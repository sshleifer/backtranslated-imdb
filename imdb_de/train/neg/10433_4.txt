The fight scenes were great. Loved the old and newer Cylons and how they painted them on their side. It was the end that I hated. I was disappointed that it was Earth 150,000 years ago. But to travel all the way to start over? Are you kidding me? People who have fought for their existence and once they reach paradise, are they abandoning technology? Under no circumstance. Sure, they ate paper and rationed food, but that's over. You can live like humans again. You only have a good doctor. What do they do when someone has toothache, it does not bother to give birth ... yes, right. Nobody would have made that choice.
