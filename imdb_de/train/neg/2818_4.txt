Genius (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical, Biblically-cited archaeologist father (William Finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks and scolds in his cell. Genius is seduced by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who rides naked on a horse, and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who familiarizes her with opium smoking, leading to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers on a snake, one Orgy and her father preaching in the background! In the meantime, Black Cult cult members behead the eye balls and slit their throats. As genius slides drugs into her tea, she faces de Sade in front of a cross, a golden woman in a green thong and herself bloody on a snake-covered bed. It is all because she is the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This normally sloppy production by Harry Alan Towers is superfluous, unsightly and pretty pointless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography, and site work are all great. At least there's always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
