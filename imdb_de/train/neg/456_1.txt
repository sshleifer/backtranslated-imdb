Add to the list of cartoons: a southern preacher and a "congregation," a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing choir, and the Mills Brothers - that only makes it worse for Negroes, who often appear in movies themselves, to parody herself and her race. Although the "Negro Comedy" may have been accepted in her day, today she is extremely offensive and I doubt she was ever funny. Although I would not have been insulted, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak humor attempts. As an eleven-year-old white boy, I might not have understood something of it.
