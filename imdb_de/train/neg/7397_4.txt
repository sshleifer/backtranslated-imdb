I've seen this movie several times at various short film festivals and I always get the impression that I've seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> Because a school film is very well produced and staged, but the story ... well, it took something else to be a bigger and more interesting movie. The character named Tim Watcher needed an in-depth approach. This is something that is missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
