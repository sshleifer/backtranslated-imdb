The idea is nice. It's great to bring so many stars into a movie. But .... too many stories, too short and really pointless. No connection between the scenes. There were a few 3-4 genius stories ... but these were 18 years old. The frame reminded me of "All the invisible children" - a movie that I really liked. By comparison, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the fascinating short story that develops - begins and ends. And the theme that connects all these children is missing. I do not find Paris enough of a subject to link 18 short sketches together. Maybe it's interesting for people who know Paris. Otherwise I would not recommend it ...
