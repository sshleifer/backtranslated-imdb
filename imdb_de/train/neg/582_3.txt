Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which are still in great resonance today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh, nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate inclination to orbit and orbit around everything, which made the viewer rather sick. It's a mystery to me why the director has not put an end to that - but perhaps he was too busy trying and somehow failing to make good performances of these normally excellent but inappropriately cast actors. All in all, a weak adjustment. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or reread) the book.
