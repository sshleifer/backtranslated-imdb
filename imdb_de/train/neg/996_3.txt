Revenge is one of my favorite topics in the movie. Moreso, "Futility of Revenge", is one of my favorite themes in the movie. After seeing Gaspar Noes Irreversible (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this topic. Instead, this film is a weak, half-hearted attempt that expresses nothing more than the film's lack of conviction and focus. came as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. The movie does not even follow that. Instead, the extended scene (whose FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape in both graphic and ritualization levels) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face, either with regret or "this didn" you can not fix anything "while the rape My rapist continued in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not a shock, but confusion about what such a graphic scene was trying to reach the audience, I mean, we feel bad for the rapist Are we disgusted by the brutality of everything, are we feeling Dawson's moment of regretful clarity, apart from this failure, the film is awkward in style rather than substance, characters are thin, dialogues are monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to shoot movies on their own terms, but Descent did not seem effective to know what that was. Thumbs down.
