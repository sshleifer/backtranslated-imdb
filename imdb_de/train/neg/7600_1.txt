This film proves that good action comes from a good direction and that is not the case in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but he is teen in it. Donald Sutherland looks like an amateur. Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is terrible and the actors look bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only imagine when it would be finished, and I turned it off halfway. The director has done a very bad job, and although I have not read the novel, he is certainly a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film tries to convey and the message and action never reach the audience. In a word, it's a horrible movie.
