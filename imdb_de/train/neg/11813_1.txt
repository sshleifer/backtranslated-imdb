Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the biggest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of budget flights, many of which were parodies of key Hollywood features. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal series of parodies in Joe Rock's smaller (and more needy) production company. <br /> <br /> Most Laurel parody movies were just a little bit weird at the time and even less fun for modern viewers who have not seen the original film that Laurel is parodying. 'West of Hot Dog' is a pretty generic parody of cowboy shooters. It is just a specific parody of "West of the Pecos", an otter released two years ago without major players. Since "West of the Pecos" has never been a great success, it's hard to understand why Stan's film unit chose this film as the target for their funeral service, let alone waiting so long to parody it after its release. And where did you get the title "West of Hot Dog"? It may be due to the fact that "Hot Dog!" was a sexual interjection that was favored by American Lecher in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the stage play 'Machinal'.) <br /> <br /> 'West of Hot Dog' was produced and directed by Joe Rock. Among many other achievements, Rock introduced Laurel Lois to Neilson and he was the best man at their wedding. Full Disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him. At that time, almost ninety years old, Rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he did not remember anything about 'West of Hot Dog', and I can not blame him. This movie is very memorable. <br /> <br /> The character of the leading actress is called Little Mustard: If that's a parody of something in "West of the Pecos", I do not understand it. There are some "impossible" gags here, including Laurel's method of climbing a horse. For a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the big Buster Keaton when he suddenly ran off. "West of Hot Dog" is similar in content and sound to Keaton's short comedy "The Frozen North," but the version of Keaton is much funnier. The plot of this film anticipates a situation in Keaton's feature film "Our Hospitality," but suffers from it again: Here, two tough Varmint brothers await the Last Chance Hall, but the previous owner left him to weakening tender foot Stan. The brothers, however, become legal heirs when Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, is such a legacy legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, all other property or inheritance issues will be his decision, not the previous owner's decision. I had plenty of time to think about these legal issues while watching this boring comedy. <br /> <br /> At one point, a gag brings with it some rough animations that are drawn directly to the movie supply. It looks cheap and is not funny. <br /> <br /> This 'hot dog' is no wine and no winner: he is just a winser. My rating: a point of ten points. Wait, Stan: in a few years you'll be half of a comedy legend.
