It has its merit; Morvern Callar is both the merit and the disappointment. She is so puzzling, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost pain that makes her so distant and incomprehensible? Or does she call her a revolutionist as a critic? Personally, I would call her dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern dissolves completely. She sent her boyfriend, not thinking of informing the family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, and she selfishly splashing on a trip to Spain. It seems to be so empty of relatively human barbarism. The only element that allows the audience to see the human side of her is her close friend, who takes her on vacation with her. Although her friend is finally dumped and Morvern has nothing to bind her to humanity. She could have killed herself as well. <br /> <br /> Although Spain has been able to look as bleak and boring as the director's recordings in the UK are great, the lighting and color make the film visually stunning. <br /> <br /> It's a pity the movie has nothing interesting about it. It's just over 90 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. They manage to make Morvern interesting to attract your attention, but do not do anything with it, but alienate yourself more from the point where you are not interested in the characters or the movie.
