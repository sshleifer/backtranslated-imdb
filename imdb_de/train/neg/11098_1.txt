Like most people, I was intrigued to hear the concept of this film, especially the "filmmaker being attacked" aspect that the case seems to emphasize, which is traced by an angry mob with the image on the cover of the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> To watch the movie and to discover, oh, what they meant by "the filmmakers are being attacked", some kids threw stones at a sign and some people complained loudly and said, " Someone should beat up these two kids. "The picture on the cover," The Persecution ", so to speak? Total Production What I suspect is related to the theme of the film, lies and manipulation, to satisfy futile, stupid children with more money and time. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me", but when "Roger & Me" Moore mocks the people of Flint. It is completely misguided and completely crazy. Impressive! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What a jerk! And it's not so much "Consider the impact of capitalism and the Western media, blah blah blah", because it's not just that their fake market had prices comparable to their competitors, it was that many people in the movie say The prices were absurdly low, someone mentioned that they should know that it was wrong how much they charged for duck. This proves nothing except that people who are poor go to a shop that has low prices, the way people hold it down. <br /> <br /> Kind of a silly joke playing in the elderly. You should be very proud. How about making a documentary about Iraq for your next movie and showing how people really get excited about a house with no bullet holes in the walls and then say, "HAHA, NO HOUSE IS THERE!" SONG TO THE MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan" Please Like Me "Spurlock has unleashed this wet fart of a movie, and it's no surprise, as Spurlock appears as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world, his weight seems behind every dumb-sounding concept, to be relevant in a world that really has no need for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague.
