The plot is about the death of small children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the film, it seems that he has problems with his daughter. In the end, the serial killer gets caught. That's it. But before you find out who does not know, you have to see a terrible spectacle of all the actors. It's unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but too much time wasted. Just do not look at the movie. I warned you.
