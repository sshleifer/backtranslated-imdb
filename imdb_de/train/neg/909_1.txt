Never consider this sad excuse for a movie. The way it is filmed, lit, traded, etc. just does not make sense. It's all so bad that it's hard to see. Lots of clips will be repeated without boredom. There does not seem to be a "normal" person in the entire movie, and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, it just does not exist. and why does this bald guy suddenly become invincible? This movie is beyond stupidity. Zero.
