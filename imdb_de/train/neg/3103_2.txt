So there's an old watchman and a guy who dies, and then there's KEVIN, the biggest wuss in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, brave and virgin friend AMY. When he returns from work to a ... random house, he finds his "friends", the sexually confusing, red-shortened KYLE and the truly disgusting slut DAPHNE. They are soon accompanied by Daphne's friend, the trigger-happy, sex-crazy macho lunkhead NICK. And there are the title creatures, terrible little puppy-like puppets that kill people by giving them their hearts. Kyle's heart wants to mate with a spooky, happy spandex woman. Nick's heart is throwing shells into a primary school cafeteria - I mean, nightclub. Kevin's heart is to hit a thin stick with nunchakus. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is a disgusting bitch, so she does not have a heart's desire. Along the way, a really vile band sings a really strange song. The hobgoblins accidentally return where they came from and exploded. "Citizen Kane" can not stick to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
