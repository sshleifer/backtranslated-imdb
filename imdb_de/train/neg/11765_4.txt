You know what you get when you buy a hallmark card. A juicy, banal verse and that will be $ 3.99, thank you. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine, who is retiring to let us know that he is not actually dead, as we thought. Poor Ernie, he's the poor soul that Ethel Merman married a few years ago, and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film Ernie jumps first in the feet and portrays the grandfather, who combines with his long-lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You like this movie, but please do not say you were not warned.
