A sexually obsessed chef has a double life: the one married as a "happy" man with a 10-year-old child, the other as a sexual friend. Most of the documentary film follows him on five consecutive days and in retrospect is told to Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist who hears his story and intelligently examines it. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only adult protagonist who does not undress. If she had, I would have rated this movie with a fat "F". As it is, it rates an F +, which means it's still a failure if you do not want to be bored. It is probably more interesting to clean the garage for 90 minutes. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that you once saw, you wish you had not done it.
