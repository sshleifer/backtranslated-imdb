Well, I do not think the picture is as bad as it is in most reviews. , , However, there is no denying that there are problems. <br /> <br /> Mostly the problems are in the script. There is an action - but not much history, and certainly not one that could be considered plausible; it trudges any number of self-confident and / or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, whatever you have and in the end it just does not add much in that department. <br /> <br I'm sorry, but I do not care what "socially ill" is what Farnsworth wants to address; There will always be a part of the population willing to do almost anything to destroy their brains, even if they have to run around corn fields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever these idiots do. As a movie, I do not call "Iowa" "important." But stylistically, the picture is more than interesting, and some of Farnsworth's decisions on showing a beaten state of a meth-head are beautiful, funny, disturbing and - I'll say - inspired /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent but that may be a victim of the anticipated stylistic reach. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but here she is not very good, so a discriminating audience has to ask, "What happened?" It's strange that Diane Foster creates a simplicity and grace that comes so close to so few of the other actors. For example, I could seriously consider what statement Farnsworth might give Michael T. Weiss as probation officer, but I doubt I would ever buy it. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> Then it's the liveliest and the moment I've seen John Savage for years. So go to the picture. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that is exciting but does not promise - and that's fine; Neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. Whether Farnsworth has another movie or not remains to be seen, but if he does, it seems quite likely that he is not a dull daddy. At a time when people are planning their lives around the last part of "American Idol," we may be able to allow Farnsworth's legitimate and undoubtedly flawed film not to be despised. <br /> <br /> What's more, we might welcome his energetic and sometimes strange, idiosyncratic imagination.
