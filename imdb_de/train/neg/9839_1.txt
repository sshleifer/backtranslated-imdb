The beginning of this movie was good. It got pretty stupid when he told people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a small town, I would be offended if I saw this movie. They made many of these people look stupid and crazy. How could these people have so little to do that they follow him all day? Many times these people told him how they could kill themselves as if urging him on. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think that they could have made a much better ending to this film. There were also some good parts in this movie. Some people may like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
