This is not a movie. It's a collection of disjointed, ill-designed and ill-posed scenes that look like the unprocessed results of a 10-year-old with a miniature DV camera. In fact, I have the theory that the extremely grubby girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, the look of the Dead Pan, the iPod and the nervous tic - probably shot herself in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you have left the ten minutes behind, do not try to bring what you have seen into the context of the European artist mentality that was praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have brought William One-Shot Beaudine to its knees. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless array of vacuum packed characters depicts what now passes for much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors shooting social traffic at the Wal-Mart snack bar?
