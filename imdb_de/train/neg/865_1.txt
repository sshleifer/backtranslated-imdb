I had the misfortune to sit all 102 minutes of the horribly bad movie in my opinion. It fails on almost every level. the cast is terrible, the actor's ham at best and the action lacks the depth, so I feel violently apathetic as to the result of one of the twisted storylines. This genre has the leeway to mediate, and I crawl in the various places where The script regularly makes its wrong assessments, somewhere in the direction of the comedy region. <br /> <br />
