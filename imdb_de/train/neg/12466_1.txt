I could not wait to get the DVD after hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing movies I have ever seen. So many characters were introduced, some were similar to others, making it impossible to follow history. I could not understand how George Clooney got a movie acting award, as he was barely involved in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up on misery after about an hour and stopped the DVD. I might have thought about the fast-forward to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion decided that chances of improvement were slim. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "comes together" in the last minute or less. I was glad that I did not give up another hour of waiting. I gave away the DVD the next day.
