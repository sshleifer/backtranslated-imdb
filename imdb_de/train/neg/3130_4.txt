I came into this movie and wanted to put it in scene. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ready for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I took this for the B-movie that it is. Nevertheless, it remained behind the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glassy and the end made me a little cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all, I give 4 a great idea, but the movie could have done much more, with a bit more attention for filmmaking. Is it worth seeing? I did not want two hours back, but I do not know that I would recommend it to others.
