Before I saw this movie, I had very low expectations and just wanted to see the cars. At some point, I even regretted leaving for that reason. Action is almost nonexistent. Character development does not exist. There were so many clich√©s in the movie and such an incredible cheese factory that I could only stare and wonder how it was even published. Without the exotics, I would not even have rated this movie as "1". The attempt at a coherent story is destroyed by the absurdity of this elite racing cult and the ridiculous characters of its members. In fact, the plot of the movie is so predictable and simple that an average child could predict the majority of the plot. Bad acting, bad action, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead to quench your thirst for fast, sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
