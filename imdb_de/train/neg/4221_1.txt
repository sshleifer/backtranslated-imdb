Quite possible. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least if he stayed in France) has managed to make a film that is so completely incomparable, is beyond mere mortals. It's not just that the characters are so unlikely, or that the movie itself is so completely lacking in the lowest form of joke: it's really physically painful to watch, an endless parade of inappropriate writing, acting, and movies you can not believe the work of experienced and talented filmmakers. For a moment in which eternity is spent before blinking and on the shelf before blinking and on the shelf, she tells the whole story. What did they think?
