At first glance at the Plot slogan, I thought it might be a decent movie. Could I have ever been more wrong? At the beginning of the film, it looks like some freaks have teamed up and decided to shoot a low budget movie. In the first 10 minutes you will not notice the cheesy acting, the awful sound and the terrible special effects, but it gets worse. After about 20 minutes, I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask this question if I did not laugh out of the sheer lameness of this movie. The lead actor has an attitude for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the movie, though he should go through love, hate and everything in between. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because I was able to watch an extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie live. Now we are in the middle of the film, where it's obviously trying to demolish Morpheus from "The Matrix," though he's only doing a terrible job. The actor talking about "Star Wars" and fortune cookie sentences is almost unbearable. At the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie because you think the storyline is finally developing. The character "Morpheus" dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie. He says a few words and the credits roll. What's this? No conspiracy, bad behavior, cheesy everything, it could not be worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT OBSERVE THIS FILM!
