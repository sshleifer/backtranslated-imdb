If I had rated this film with 0, I would have! I see some people at IMDb stating that this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. Excuse me? Do you have a cold or LSD ........? It's absolutely NOT funny about this movie. N O T H I N G! I actually want my 27 minutes back in my life that I spent with this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane and did not see this movie after 30 minutes. I fully understand that I actually saw snakes twice on the plane instead of seeing this movie once! <br /> <br /> DO NOT take a look at this movie, do something else useful with your life.
