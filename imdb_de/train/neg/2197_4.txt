This story goes back to the days of the matinee, when children who could not hang around anywhere took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings downstairs. It did not matter what was on the screen - the little kids were sitting and the big kids ignored it. Of course the adults would never see it. <br /> <br /> But they brought it to the video along with most of the creaking, cheap "B" horror flicks of the Golden Age. from television. The film's inherent and unintentional humor derives from outdated ideology (the "bad girls" that were harvested to replace poor Jan's shattered body - they had it weird) overused action (a mad scientist trying to divine God a violent, but conscientious monster (whose presence is never fully explained in the hitherto normal-looking scientist's rural laboratory, and action that polarises on wood or over-the-top.) <br /> <br /> This is a great party movie, provided your guests like adding dialogues and comments to otherwise vile cinematic exploits, and if you or your guests prefer passive entertainment, this movie is also available as a video in Mystery Science Theater 3000 editing, in which the moderator and the puppets of the cult TV series make the necessary additions for you ,
