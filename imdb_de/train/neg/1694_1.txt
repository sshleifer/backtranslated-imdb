This movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. This is below average (even below) and has no graphical representation. I mean, in any house you can feel scared and safe, a dead Japanese woman would scare the shit out of you, but what's up? Make a movie that appeals to viewers and not just shows images of scared people and a few hairs (dead Japanese). Can you say "terrible rip-off of Samara (The Ring)"? Do not let me start with the "dead child". Not even scary! So what? He has a cat and can imitate her, big crazy deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that may be hurt by the grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
