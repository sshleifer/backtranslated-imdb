I wonder when watching this movie: Did the producers of this film save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by pulling out their "before" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also come to sleepwalking by being cast in front of Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted, the film is very formulaic. On top of that, the Deja Vu viewer experiences the character of Cassie Maywether as a darker Gracie Hart with more background story and quickly becomes a nipple party. <br /> <br /> The two Bad Boy serial killers have been made (and better) in other films before. Thus, the "Good Guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence" has seen character earlier. In fact, none of the characters in the film goes beyond two-dimensional dimensions or tries to be anything but banal stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last person - by the term serial killer is the term false advertising. Murder of a person - even if it is a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer or even a Spree killer.
