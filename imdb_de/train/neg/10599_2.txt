** HERE AT SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government has developed the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and can take more damage than before. However, the government is facing downsizing, the project is in jeopardy and the supercomputer, which is in the middle, feels threatened. Therefore, he takes steps to ensure his safety. He activates and controls the UniSols and begins to cause chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreographed fights. The story is bad and soon drowned in all battles. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately, it's no fun to watch a fight where you know that part of it is indestructible. Normally, you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the battles are between two pretty same fighters. Not where you are indestructible and can not lose. Then the battles become a tool to stretch time. They wait until the last fight, when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to defeat his unbeatable enemies. In my opinion, a desperate and sure indication of a bad movie is how little dressed women are. Well, there are not that many of them, because the characters are the most men (there is at least one woman UniSol), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown with at least one bra once. The female leads can handle it, but we also go through a strip club (to use a computer) with a lot more undressed women. These moments give nothing to history and are only there to try to appeal to the youthful male audience. <br /> <br /> Finally, boring fights. No more and no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
