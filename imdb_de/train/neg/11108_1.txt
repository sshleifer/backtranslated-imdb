Where to start The movie started pretty well, but after the 30-minute mark I caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the beginning of the film was good, but then the story started. It just got fatter and stupider as time went by. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this movie, but I got a bit bored with Vinny Jones, who is always gloomy in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the movie moved on and took my word for it, he got dressed, he was getting farther and farther away. <br /> <*** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, towards the end, when skeletal monsters show up just to eat the dead which made no sense at all. It turned out that it was a kind of carnivorous cult, and the good ones die in the end. The end just made me laugh, how bad it was. As soon as the lead role is over Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> Finally, Creep made the best horror movie ever made. I gave him a star because the female lead did a pretty good job, but even she could not save that train wreck of a movie !!
