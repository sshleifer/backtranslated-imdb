What should I say about this movie? Well, it's about a couple of good students who have bad drugs and turn into delinquent disciples selling more bad drugs to those affected. Two of these people are detrimental, as one turns into a poisonous avenger and his girlfriend throws a creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's all there is and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. That's not fair, but some people like Troma's movies and they can watch it if they want. Troma movies are for me the worst there is. I just looked at it out of curious curiosity.
