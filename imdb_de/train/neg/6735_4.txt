The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's good. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances of the actor playing the handsome groom Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor, and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor, who criticizes Messing's potential outfits in an early scene, brings a delightfully absurd and yet winning quality to the process. Okay, that's it on the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more credible and expresses contempt for brass than in any scene where he tries to be either business or supportive. As others have noted, he does not seem to have an emotional investment in this business than to complete it as soon as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to wear the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. It's enough, but it's just not strong enough to do it without help. Give her an "E" for effort and a "C +" for achievement. Given the indifference of Mulroney, the only thing that could have helped Brass would have been a brilliant, earthy, irons-demanded performance by the actor who played her ex-fianc√© Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, confused and wordless. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze them further, obviously I would pay more attention than most people involved. It's harmless enough to pass the time when you have nothing else to do, and less intrusive (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but it's far better to review "My Best Friend's Wedding".
