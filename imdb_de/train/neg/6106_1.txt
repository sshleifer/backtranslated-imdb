That was just awful, the plot was just fine, but the rest was bad. I mean, come on doll and then they even tried to make the movie digital, and that made it even worse! Normally, I would prefer low-budget movies, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me return the set that came with it. I have about ten low budget movies with about 6-8 movies, and I would say that this is the worst movie of all. Also, the wording is out and they use fake plastic makers who do not even look like a real one, they could be a used one that even comes very close to a real one, so save time and money, and do not look at that horrible movie.
