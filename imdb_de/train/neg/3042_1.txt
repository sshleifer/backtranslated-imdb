I can write 1000 words about this movie, but one word might be enough: bizarre. My husband and I did not even laugh when we stared at this really awful movie. We always met with our best "What the ...?" Expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny, but that's just sick. What kind of mind produces such images and then presents them to others for film? What kind of spirit does innocent children include in this weird, crazy movie, and then packs it as if it were suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, do not let this movie see you. Teenagers can see it - probably with "What the ...?" Expressions on their faces. If you decide to add this movie to others, you may want to stick your eggnog.
