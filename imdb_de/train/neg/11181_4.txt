The film is about two stories: one is a political murder of a call girl, the other a political party of the upper class. The crossroads is the public relations Al Paccino plays as he witnesses the crime and instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is no longer terrible without decent dialogue and directing For any drama, Al's notion is memorable: how many fellows can be as convincing as a powerful and dreaded man (like "The Godfather") like here as a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco") /> <br /> Actually, the big young lion got tired. This passing of ages is very moving because the public thinks about aging too. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up because he can get his energy back in the church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's good that the movie is so horrible because it puts Al's talent in the foreground!
