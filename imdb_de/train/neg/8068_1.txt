I did not have much expectations for this movie when I lent it for $ 1 at the video store, but the box at least made a small promise with their "killer cut" of "more gore! More sex!" Can not go wrong! Well ... The box is of course scam. How did actors and actresses of this caliber register for such a low-profile movie? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunken college girl walking out of a community hall or other building like this and some of it is telling useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a steadicam follows her. Then she is followed by a guy in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. They cut their wrists for no real reason and you can see if they are "cut" that someone has drawn the cuts with a crayon. <br /> <br /> Repeat the same topic of the girl being hunted I was killed unjustifiably by two men for 84 minutes. Add in one shot. These are Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had a problem with this movie if the box had not seduced me to rent the movie. If I lend a bad movie claiming to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A complete frontal shot in 85 minutes of a chick that is clearly androgynous and bloody and would not scare a child does not cut it off. If this is the killer cut, what is the theatrical version ?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage ever came to the cinemas. Shame on the actors in this movie. I could see them making their screen premieres here because they did not do anything before, but they were all set before the release. I do not know if it was filmed before they were all set up and the studio was in the movie until they were half-sized names or not. But what I want to know is ... they really spent $ 14 million on this movie ?!
