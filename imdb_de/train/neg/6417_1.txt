How do comments like those that were the headlines of high school girls, even on this website? This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. It was ridiculous. How can an idiot sit there and say that a movie just makes you jump, it's a good movie, that's perhaps the stupidest thing I've ever heard, I could sneak up behind you and go "boo" and it would be you Jumping, but that does not mean I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, let alone "they've got everything tied up" is not a good reason for a movie to be well received. What a movie it would be if they did not tie everything together. I think that would make half a movie, not a whole movie. Basically, this idiot girl is a compliment to the end of the movie. Well, I love how the youth of today keeps the media and production companies at such a high level. No wonder the political system of this country can get away with anything they want. We have such idiots who appear in our country. What would happen if this girl would someday lead something, that's a scary thought. Get a live and watch a real movie, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront or something like that and do not comment that it was "boring" after you saw it, just use the little brain, that God has given you to analyze it a bit
