"I am a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What is that supposed to mean?! This action could not be worse, because a boy who is afraid of everything gets very brave at the end of the movie because he went to a library. The sole purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, if a cheaper and more effective method of doing so could have been a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as the so-predictable librarian, that he is a "side master") could save this pointless film from the boring plan. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy or the Hollywood God of Voices, Frank Welker as cartoon characters, do not save it. I can only describe it as an equivalent from the 1990s that matches the still gruesome adaptation of the 1978 Water Babies, because the dull animation makes the movie worse and does not improve the boring plot!
