I do not often distribute "one," but if there's ever been a movie that deserves this kind of attention, then it's "gas!" This is selfish crap that depends on the ambiance of M * A * S * H ​​and falls flat out of the window when trying. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman wanted - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's indefatigable role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the movie "Whiffs") - see here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com) / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould came closer with "Whiffs" to the brass ring than Corman with "Gas!" but not quite there. None of these films could approach the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's up with "gas!"? What is not No one is close to really acting on a level that is beyond the theatrics of junior high school. The production values ​​stink. Someone else mentioned here the magically regenerating headlights of a getaway car, and there is still more lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way it should be in this movie and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually got me to sleep. It's not a safe cure for insomnia, but really close. On the cinematic sleep induction scale "Gas!" It's somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (which was remarkable because it was more boring than the original of Mosfilm, although this studio did not seem familiar with the idea, the audience's attention by careful editing). <br /> <br /> Careful editing would have "gas!" until about twenty minutes. The result would be meaningless, but not more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Certain films are so bad that they have a convincing quality that makes them worth watching. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It is not even bad.
