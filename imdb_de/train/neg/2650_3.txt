When I was exposed to mediocrity on television, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree with this garbage? The film uses meaningless, fictional storylines to deliver thousands of garbage. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The movie was meaningless and all credibility was lost through overuse of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton made an effort to make this movie worthwhile, but in the end she has to remember the age-old adage that you can not get a damn. I hope you did not miss your New Year's Day while shooting another thoughtless TV movie. I now know why the networks began airing series on Sunday night to rid us of garbage!
