1. Seen 06.12.2009 - 4 von 10 Punkte (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from my point of view to character development from this much-praised Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There are a few good songs and a decent comic depiction of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the movie does not do the situation and the settings really well. I can only blame the script and possibly some actors for why we do not fully understand the characters and their situation. I know that maybe it's a bit too much to be asked about a musical intended for enjoying the songs and dancing, but I also did not particularly notice that part. The basic plot is about an Englishwoman who comes to Siam to teach the children upscale European things. We later learn that the king is actually the greatest student. There is a forbidden romance between the king's latest wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latino as an Arab - come on !!) and a former lover who has caused some complications but has added nothing really intriguing. Deborah Kerr, as the female protagonist Annie - is fine, but not so convincing. The king learns some things through their presence and then the film becomes less and less. This is really a tiny story with some songs and dances, but not really a great experience for a viewer.
