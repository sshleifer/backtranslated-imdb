I'll re-live the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger with the storyline Alice survived after surviving the final episode of the Nightmare series. This time, the mocking murderer beats through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "reborn" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? This movie started out really well when we saw Alice dream of being Amanda Kruger, who gets stuck in the room and raped by 100 manicans. Then she is taken to the hospital, but she is no longer the pregnant woman, but then she gives birth to Freddy again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two who returned from the 4th movie and then made new friends. '' Freddy starts killing again. I liked the first death. not as good as the other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself did not seem to be scary in this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring, really, they were not scary or scary at all. <br /> <br /> Playing in movies was okay for a fifth movie in the series, but overall I think this movie was really boring. (Still not the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
