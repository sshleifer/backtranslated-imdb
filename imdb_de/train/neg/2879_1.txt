This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas. This movie contains no truth at all. It's like they accepted the BTK name and made out the rest. In addition, it looks like someone only got $ 20. Take a movie and do not be afraid to get btk research. No one should ever see this film seriously pure dookie. The slaughter of scenes of killing and the sacrificial meal of his victims and the description of animal slaughtering BTK has done nothing of it, but the film does this for the love of God, to never see this God terrible movie. The ones made for television are much better and much more accurate
