Flat, ordinary thriller about a deceitful woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceitful Tracey, married to Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, the difficulties are not far behind him. Script fails in that it does not carefully set the promise to an effective, tantalizing thriller and the pronounced lack of character motivation, background and development leave the entire show stagnant. None of the performers are able to arouse interest in their flat characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. and can not make a conversation out of it. By the time the "secret" of the plot is revealed, you do not care. <br /> <br /> At least, Massachusetts Cinematography looks good. Also the stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
