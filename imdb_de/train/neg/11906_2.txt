Seeing "The Sky over Berlin" as a teenager in the late 1980s was a profound experience for me - "that's how the films could be". Besides "Paris, Texas" and "To the End of the World", it still has a special place in my heart and mind - proof of the genius of Wim Wenders. Unfortunately, there were later years A steady loss of quality of his work with "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" reached a terrible low. The fascinating pictures or music are over. No search or display of great insights. All that's left are characters and thinly disguised political statements that amount to nothing but stereotypes and frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to either increase it or stop it altogether.
