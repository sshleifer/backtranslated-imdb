After I had looked at that, I thought, there are either too few good authors and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a horrible movie. Terrible in a way that it's not fun, but makes you clench your teeth and make them tremble. Leave the movie "that's wrong" call. Immersion is zero. By now, most of you are probably used to the terrible mistakes / crazes in movies that computer hackers etc. contain. This movie is so in every way. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily who is brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope she gets big and makes it all worth something. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not watch that. There is not even right action in it. Total waste of time.
