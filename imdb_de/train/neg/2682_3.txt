I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time after seeing "Return to Paradise", which I found poor. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable end, which in my opinion was partly stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like Danes' character and it annoyed her at first. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything real about the movie. It could be so much better, for example, prison conditions and sheer horror could be more emphasized. It was too cheerful to be realistic. It could also give more action and excitement <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is the "tragic" end. I could not predict that. But at the time, I really did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
