that's a terrible, horrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all TOOO long. the longest movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> the stories are all too damned over the top !!!! <br /> <br /> There are actually too many stories that occur in the story line is ruined. <br /> <br /> the comedy was not a comedy !!!!! It was not funny at all ... <br /> <br /> The story is so repulsive and poorly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ... <br /> <br /> I had some Expectations of this film ......... but my expectations were in the first minutes completely crashed ...... <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is the MUSIC .... .. and of course Vidya Balan. She is the best performer and distinguishes herself among all the older actors ... she is just a freshman and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the blondes who play his love interest also help save this catastrophic film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of taxi driver. and the blonde also offers a very subtle and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> Another talented actress Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his role well, but it seemed too over the top !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only one who is not wasted is Salman /> <br /> All in all, this is a very impossible movie with Mishmashed script and TOOO Masladar that the action is designed after the stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 is four hours long !!!! Think and RETHINK before you go to the cinemas !!!!! better avoid it !!!!!
