First, the CGI in this movie was awful. I saw it during a marathon with bad movies on the sci-fi channel. In the end, if the owner of the park is killed, this is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even the night of the living dead had a better animation. <br /> <br /> That is, the movie had almost no action. Why were you special on this island? Well, it was not stated in the movie. And why should people continue to come into the realm of the cat? Makes no sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In a movie that could be called "B made for TV movie", the acting was very good. Of particular note is Parry Shen. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
