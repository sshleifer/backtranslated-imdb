What's this ? A low-budget sex comedy? Anyway, it perfectly describes the people of Spain. You might come up with a better idea, I mean, they've been making these kinds of movies since the 60s .. and people like them! This is neither a teen comedy nor a family comedy (you can not let your 12-year-old watch 2 boys kissing in bed, he'll never want to go to Spain). This should be classified as "R" since only people over 35 years seem to laugh: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is a pretty important part of the movie) /> Strange humor is terrible in movies (besides Kusturica), keep doing dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
