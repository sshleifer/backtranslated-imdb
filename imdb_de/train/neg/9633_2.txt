Is the rich, sickly Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she overreacting, as usual, or, more accurately, overreacting? In fact, both are applicable to director Joseph Losey, who moves in a bewildering mess called "boom", appropriately named, as the minds in the lush, luxurious surroundings can almost explode. Richard Burton climbs the mountain of Taylor unasked; She dresses him in a samurai robe with saber. Although great looking on widescreen displays, the picture is otherwise quite deadly. A failure that even Liz 'n Dick-Philes should avoid (the stars' collective "What the hell!" Nadir here). Pointless, confused and insane, "boom" is a disaster - though screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who has discontinued his own unsuccessful play "The Milk Train will stop stopping here", was supposedly thrilled! * from ****
