"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call it ... just does not hit the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like gangster comedies (as I thought, Oscar, Johney Dangerously, and Mafia suck too). It's probably more "witty-sharp pun" than anything but comedy. or the other reviewers) Make it up. <br /> <br /> The Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old when he started making it a running gag, it was sometimes painful to look at. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes of place or feel for the time they were in. The majority of the film was either in the "Dreyfus Club" or in various offices / Dim rooms. .. (What about this sit down gun thing that Goldblum won?) The side cast was excellent ... on paper (great to see Silva & Drago) but the characters had been shot down before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryor's cameo was a joke! The Romance and Love element of the film has also got stuck. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll come back to it soon.
