This movie is pretty shitty. I am in the army and the soldiers pictured in this movie are terrible. If you are in the military and you see this movie, you will laugh and be upset about the movie because of the way they have acted as a squad. It was ridiculous. They behaved like a bunch of normal people in army uniforms because they did not know what to do. It was a pretty bloody movie that I have to say at least. There were a few scenes where they try to jump. I would recommend it if you are bored and want to see a violent, bloody movie. It will also be a better movie if you are not in the military. I have to say that I liked the first one better than this one.
