What a fucking movie! I said I wanted to be a bad movies specialist for decades, so I decided to start this movie. It was a pretty reasonable choice. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but in this pastel mess I saw nothing of the sort. I have not really seen a lot of bad movies, but I feel that this is so bad, which is good, probably because it is so unintentionally funny! First of all there are the inaccuracies. There are action-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter are as insane as Van Dammes ass cheeks in this blue spandex. There are also extremely sticky lines, and I will not even start talking about some of the funny action steps. Aside from one particular case, there is not really bad behavior from anyone involved in this hot mess of a movie. Geoffrey Lewis looks as Frank completely pathetic, which is an absolutely stupid figure. To be honest, I was really surprised that Van Damme played the twins properly. He managed to achieve a different tone and a different mood in the two roles, which convinced me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a big movie studio, which is now bankrupt.
