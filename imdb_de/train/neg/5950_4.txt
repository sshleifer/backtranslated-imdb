After watching this movie, my first question was, "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it was not well implemented. Of course, in the boy's scenes, there was the formal use of camera angles, but much of the crucial action took place outside his field of vision. A "main character" who can not speak (evidently indicating the dumb, impotent position of a child) makes it difficult to give this character much depth. Melodrama is defined as "dramatic or other literary work" characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplified morality and conflict. "LIAM adapts this definition to a T. The viewer becomes aware of the typical stereotypes of the Catholic Fire and Sulfur Church Beaten up in the rigorous school march and the well-fed priest squeezed money from parishioners (a stereotype that gets very tiring.) What's more - the Jewish characters are lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Many of the films were predictable ... who would not have thought we would do that? Watch Theresa scrub the toilet after her mother told her, "No daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet!" I'm a fan of the British realism, if done well, in my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
