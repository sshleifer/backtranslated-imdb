The most terrible retelling of a big series. It should not have been called Battlestar Galactica because it's just the same name. Too many changes just to make changes. They have switched characters from male to female, black to Asian to Cylons to attract the female audience, if there were already strong female characters that could just be made stronger. The Egyptian feeling is over. The search for the earth is over. The absence of Cylons to return to the Terminator removes the film, especially if you make a Fembot. Granted, the original show had a lot of cheese, but it had a large following. They tried to cling to the following, but did not give the fans anything to work with and spat their faces out while making it their "own story." Changes are good when they do something better, not just to make them.
