I borrowed this movie because it is really fascinating not only because of its gay theme but also because of its roleplaying. I was pleasantly surprised that it was filmed in San Francisco since I live near SF. And, of course, it was nice to see footage of the Castro district (though the Castro is really meant for gay men rather than women). But otherwise I can not really recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me and when they finally came to the "role-playing games", I was already bored. And the role scenes I saw were a bit embarrassing to see. The action leaves much to be desired. Needless to say, I did not finish the movie. I would skip this.
