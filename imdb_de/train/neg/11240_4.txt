Shamelessly ambitious science fiction by Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a love job. Unfortunately, it's just not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock style, and the brilliant cinematography of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many sci-fi novels, series, and movies as diverse as the day Earth stood still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet of the Apes, the Iron Giant, Star Wars, and the Spy, who loved me. However, the film is not as good as any of these films for a variety of reasons: it's mostly about a love job that's all about throwing everything on the screen and creating a beautiful new movie world. Despite air battles, dinosaurs and competitions against time, there is little to no tension, atmosphere or magic here. Even the Noir elements fall off flat. However, this is a broad view of things - these elements fail mainly because nothing really feels real and so obviously wrong - the green screen only looks half as long as a video game and it is obvious that the actors afterwards glued on. The actors are not very busy either - Jude Law is made of wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - all because of a terrible script that has to explain almost everything. It's a decent experience, and some feel nostalgic, but in the end this is a meaningless step into the world of yesterday. Nice ending.
