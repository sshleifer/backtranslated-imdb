I am amazed at the positive reviews for this thoroughly inspiring film. <br /> <br /> I often pass reviews of foreign films that complain about slow tempo and apparent "absence of action," as is true of many of the best international films, the Western Hollywood model of cinematic storytelling become. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the frequent artistry and the lack of clich√©s in the foreign film arena. I'm glad that many foreign films do not tie things together in a neat, tasty little loop. <br /> <br /> That is, this movie offered no redeeming value for the time I wasted it. No meaningful character development, no exciting story arc, no opportunity to engage emotionally with the characters on screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A bunch of emotionally immature, unprincipled colonialists abuse their slaves and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the "house boy" finally gets fed up and abuses her. <br /> <br /> Although the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie will bore you as you go through the scenario. I was so incoherent that it took three sessions to finish, and I would not have done it if the positive reviews had not fallen. <br /> <br /> If you have no academic interests during this time, I strongly recommend that you stay away from this area.
