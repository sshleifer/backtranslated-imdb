The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" also applies to "Oliver". Instead of writing composers in the stylistic period of the game's settings, they merely wrote Broadway-style tunes that were historically unidiomatic and stylistically distorted. Also, the brutal brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny stuff that permeates the score. It is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a very sour undertone. <br /> <br /> The casting of the boy Oliver does not help: hesitant and annoyingly valuable, there is something less solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the melodies he is required to sing in his own way have little basis. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me" gets a severe, throaty and tense playback. The two big production numbers "Who Will Buy" and "Consider Yourself" seem to be overproduced, with everything except the sink being thrown into it. It's one thing to get out of it all, and yet another, to cross the line. <br /> <br /> The darkness, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to be suitable for such ditties and choreographies. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess that I have problems with Mr. Dickens' consciousness because his works tend to create a negative vibration. This may be due to the prolongation of his joyless private life, which was full of disappointment and remorse. <br /> <br /> Not all combined talents of this production, whether in front of or behind the camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the base material. All this leads to an unpleasant downer experience for me. <br /> <br />
