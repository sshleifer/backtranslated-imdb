I think I have to be the one to say, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this show listed for PBS last night, I was hopeful and worried. I loved "Morse" (even so much that I bought the complete DVD set) and felt that while I always liked Kevin Whatys Sgt. Lewis character, the show was John Thaw, point! After looking at the new "Inspector Lewis" (as it is billed here), I'm more than ever convinced that I was right ... which is good (though it looks awful (both badly aged as well too fat) but he just does not have the charisma to wear the show, like Thaw. <br /> <br /> And as far as his "buddy" Fox is concerned, well ... maybe the reviewers here are from England Understand what he says, but I usually can not. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... I can only say I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> It does I'm sorry to say that she should let "Morse" rest in peace.
