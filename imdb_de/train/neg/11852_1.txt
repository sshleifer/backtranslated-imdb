This film was meant to portray a young man of a lady who was willing and willing to settle down once and for all. However, I was not interested in his mission settling because I was not interested in his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women have seen in him. He had absolutely no lessons or charisma. He should at least have had a way over himself that made women in the knees weak next to his saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he's a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention that the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love with in five minutes after meeting her were outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have a shame, what? If he had cleaned up and stopped saying and saying stupid things, he would have become more attractive as a character, but his character was bland and boring. Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She might as well have been a pushy outsider with her regular speaking voice, like a faint British accent that would sometimes fade the whole movie, the fish and the frog. Now the two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both? STAT Plot holes, lack of character development, terrible drama, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a mess of a movie.
