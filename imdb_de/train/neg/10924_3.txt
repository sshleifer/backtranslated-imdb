Seeing the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes. It seemed like I had a cheaper version of the mummy. The setup was promising, in the 1920s Cecil B. Demille makes his Opus the Ten Commandments. It seems they used real Egyptian artifacts for the film, unleashing an age-old and terrible evil (not always?). DeMille is aware of what has been unleashed and orders the entire set to be buried instead of the usual practice of demolishing it. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it forever. Then we move on to the day a team tries to dig up the site (the film's first flaw, but these costumes are too expensive, and this is a sci-fi channel movie). The first sightings of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume they put in a bit of effort and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body starts. Here the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are cruelly and strangely dying get a strangely muted reaction. Once they realize that the age-old evil has been unleashed again and is on a rally, what are the leading men and women doing in the stock issue? They make the usual break for the "man who knows the truth but has not told anyone". After receiving this important information, do you share it with the comrades at the site? No, they stop at a hotel for a refreshing shower and a pleasant conversation. Actually, I'm not the most motivated person, but if I knew that a demon from ancient Egypt was at liberty, killing everyone in sight, and I was coming to me, I'd take a little care to solve the problem. After this lengthy and pointless midsection, they destroy the Anubis monster in the usual way by running around in dune buggies and shooting them down with a rocket launcher while standing next to a pile of phosphor grenades. For a sci-fi movie it was over the usual crap that they released, which does not say much. What makes me disappointed is that this would have been much more if someone had written a decent script for it.
