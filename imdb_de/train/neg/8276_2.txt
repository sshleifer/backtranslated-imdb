I knew this movie would not be great, but I thought I would give it a shot. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson and thought it had potential. Unfortunately, many dialogues of the film were very fake and cheesy. I think that Aquafresh spent some money on the production of the film because they seriously messed up some clues. There is a setting where the Aquafresh sign is directed at you and you can not help but notice it. Maybe they should focus more on writing and acting than how often we can put Aquafresh products in the movies without people getting upset about them. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
