I've seen my fair share of poorly thought-out ends and past twists about movies, but I can not remember a movie that committed such a suicide, like this one. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped that the big turn would "surprise" us all ... and it did, but maybe not as the directors had hoped. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw, either individually or together, had something to do with this turkey. <br /> <br /> The movie until the last thirty minutes was pretty captivating and I like the way the story unfolded and the nature of the movie as a whole. However, as the turn turned out, the storylines and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was unimaginable, and the way the things Bobby Earl worked out so neatly were ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse, the rest of the movie was painfully predictable as soon as the shoot turned out. Harris did a great job and Connery is like Morgan Freeman as he never performs badly, even if the movie is not great! All in all, it starts off well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.
