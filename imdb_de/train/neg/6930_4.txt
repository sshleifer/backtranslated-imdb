Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist traveling to a lunatic asylum to write about a new technique they use on their patients. However, the journalist soon learns that things are not what they seem to be and the asylum is being led by the patients and the doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are just boring and just let you fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks he's a chicken). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the movie itself bombs. The music of the movie is really weird and like something you would hear in an insane comedy, and yes, there is a scene with dancing chicken men that really made me want to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for violence and nudity.
