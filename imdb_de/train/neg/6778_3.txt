Oh sweetheart, oh honey ... For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as their A-list career in Hollywood was concerned. After solid turns in Girl Can It It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter, Jayne seemed to be on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. An obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker, however, marginalized Mansfield, namely cheap euro loans, until Fox could terminate their contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This film is really a diabolist waste of everyone's time with the exception of Suzy Parker, which is the only one in this film that is bad enough for the material. Many people blame Poor Jayne and her performance for the box office's poor earnings at the box office, and although she's in pain in this movie, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary sets the screen barely on fire, right? After a handful of very good drama and comedy phrases, Jayne, as a serious actress, takes ten steps back by agreeing (just to appear with Grant) to portray this squeaky, idiotic menace. Her character Alice is a complete comic bimbo, and though she looks good enough to eat in a cauldron suit, every movie appearance paralyzes her nerves. We all know that Jayne could be so much better than this slag, and here she's parading like a price pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Avoid the so-called comedy. It is depressing rather than funny.
