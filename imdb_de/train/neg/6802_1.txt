Words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain it by just writing. You have seen it for yourself to understand how horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend that to you. There are so many clich√©s, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that will make you cry. First of all, with the technique, there are many mistakes in relation to the aircraft. I will not list them here, but only mention the color of the plane. They did not even manage to show an airplane in the colors of a fictional airline, but used a 747 in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times, just much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I ran away from it very early. Besides, all the time I was on the side of the bad guys in the movie because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be your choice, even the "turbulence" movies are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
