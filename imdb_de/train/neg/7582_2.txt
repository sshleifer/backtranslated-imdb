High heels are tricky things. They can raise women (or men dressing up) to new heights, make a clear statement about the style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous foot pain that inevitably leads to tripping, falling and ultimately to a tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish skyscraper. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-and-daughter drama is definitely stylish, but as far as the plot is concerned, this is a tongue-tied and boring affair full of confusing complexity characters that are never completely busy or meaningful. A few moments of the comedy aside, Tacones lejanos just is not interesting. The best comes at the beginning in a macabre case of manslaughter staged by a child. From this brilliant piece of black comedy things are looking up, but then the movie comes on the heel. <br /> <br /> There are solid acting acts and there is a stylish, artistic direction that one would expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, a broken mother-daughter relationship, and a character who is alternately judge, transvestite, and police chief, this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. Instead, it is poor. High heels stumble safely.
