In my opinion, this film does not create a new idea. seems like a spear to bring me to a spear, without looking to the side! The director seems to have an agenda! Moron! I find that his rationality is lacking because there is no room for the alternative view. I'm usually one-sided, but this film is not believable because it's based on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street. If you are looking for a credible alternative to a creed that is more than 2000 years old, you will need to make more effort so that the other side can express their faith. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Christian faith. I am an infidel, but I have to consider others' beliefs and do not want them to mock them but to try to understand and understand them.
