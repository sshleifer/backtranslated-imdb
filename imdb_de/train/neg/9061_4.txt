What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days ago I had seen Lillies and that was one of the best gay movies I have ever seen. So this was not the best time to see a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the acting was fine. It was not bad enough to turn down, but there were some bad moments and horrible clich√©s. It was not very well staffed either. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you would waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made and who finances them. Instead, spend your time to see Noah's bow in the logo. I think this movie was going to go there, but it never got there.
