I saw this movie on a westbound American Airlines flight. It was so bad that the flight seemed longer. The plot had potential (who would not like to love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills any Elvis imitator she meets?), But he was screwed up a million times by really bad writing. Towards the end, there's an embarrassing scene with a band of Elvis impersonators on the rooftop of a casinos diverting the sky, thinking it would come back. A group of stars move to an "Elvis" constellation, which promptly shoots a flash of lightning at the impersonators, who let them fall through the roof. Bad ... really bad. Which is the theme for the entire movie. I would avoid this at all costs.
