Why, oh, why do not you learn it? If you have a nice, juicy exploitation game, use it! Do not try to make everything deep and thoughtful. They will just look stupid. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a bit too much of mom when she kissed Santa Claus was a kid Harry naturally gets obsessed with Christmas and when his disillusionment gets too big, he jumps out, disguises himself as Santa Claus and wanders through the city, where he gives toys to good little children and kills anyone whom he considers naughty. <br /> <br /> Simple enough and not a bad place to start. (How many other horror films based on vacation motifs use the same thing?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more "Santa, Portrait of a Serial Killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent documenting Harry's slow but inevitable collapse when I was ready to buy the premise as the opening titles rolled. You know a Slasher movie is in trouble if you urge the killer to cope with it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent into madness was imperatively in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only movie, and it shows. The action jumps nimbly from scene to scene, without taking pictures or clear views of the actors, to let us know where we are and who we see. <br /> <br /> Even with the movie running, we are still treated with much support for Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. Christmas Evil is more depressing than scary.
