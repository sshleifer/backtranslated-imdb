When asked how I would define the word "flat," I would answer, "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production." When asked how I would define the term "wasted potential," I would answer, "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production." Bruckheimer productions are almost always sure that fire is hit at the box office, but almost always critical pannings from the critics. I can only imagine that an OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN will find much recognition. <br /> <br /> Also CRIMSON TIDE was eagerly acclaimed by critics. It's certainly one of Bruckheimer's better films, which unfortunately does not say much. The problem I had is the scenario that sets the story: the Russians are fighting against the Chechens, and the conflict is spreading all over Russia, leading to an ultranationalist Russian taking on a nuclear missile base and threatening the West. The end of the Cold War may have had anything to do with it, but I thought that was not very convincing. Some geographic errors such as the French carrier Foch, which is located in the Mediterranean Sea (would the Foch not be better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or the exposure newsreel consist of family shots of conflicts in the Balkans, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Again, the adjective "very unconvincing" came to my mind. The story improves a little when the real story - a battle of will between a submarine commander and his number two - begins. Director Tony Scott does his best on the cast, but the problem is still in an unconvincing scenario. Worst of all, if the film had been made in the mid-eighties, it would have been a real possibility for World War III - no likelihood - that this film would have frightened me. However, after the end of the Cold War, the dangers of nuclear war had little effect.
