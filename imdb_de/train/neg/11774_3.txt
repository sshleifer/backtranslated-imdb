The unfortunate mistake of watching this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well received from the beginning, but that is the last positive comment I have on the film. The acting was terrible, I wonder if actually Gogo girls were hired? But it was the action that was really ridiculous, in fact, it was ridiculous and not boring, the only reason why I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Lower spoiler **. <br /> <I just want to mention some of the scenes that really made the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Push the girl into the field: Who would have thought that a child pushing another child could be treated that way badly. A true eye opener. <br /> <br /> Getting into the bus scene: The girl gets on the bus. But according to the music, the world is coming to an end. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothesline: Wow, that really demonstrates the skills of the clerk. In the room followed by raw meat and selling skills. Why should not she make her do all three sins at the same time? At least then the movie might have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> Walking the stairs of the mall: Watch as one of the girls flies down the stairs being chased by a carnivorous dhow, no wait. She just runs fast and does not try to break her nails. <br /> <br /> The blood-covered run: This is definitely my favorite scene and a fitting ending to the movie. A half-marathon in red, completed by stairs and bridges, only to be unrealistically blown up by a passing car. Not only that, but this suicide is undertaken by the film's most selfish girls, now it's up to you for the character. <br /> <br /> I would like to believe that this movie was created by a 16-year old film and her pals. Unfortunately, this is not the case after meeting the director at the presentation. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood and start laughing with some friends ... you still do not even think about it.
