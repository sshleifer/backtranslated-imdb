This could be the worst movie I have ever staged. Incoherent would be a compliment. Even the end made no sense, but it was a great relief that it was finally over. I watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could get any worse and it did. At the end of this mess I was sorry that none of the characters had survived and I did not feel much responsible for the actors either. If you want to see a train wreck, I recommend sitting at a train station. Even waiting on an abandoned platform overcomes this chaos. Apparently I did not ventilate enough to fill my prescribed ten lines, so I'll say it again at the risk of being released. This movie is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
