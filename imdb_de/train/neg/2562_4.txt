Let me begin by saying that this film has a funny point at the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm new George. Studio too cheap to pay for Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get that role? George: New George is just lucky, I think. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's the only funny part in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But on the other hand I'm easy to talk to ... <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen have (this title goes to the terribly merry catastrophe movie ...). <br /> <br /> If you're a small kid that's easy to talk to, you'll love this movie. If you are a movie watcher and want to have a good, funny movie, you will end up taking half pictures yourself.
