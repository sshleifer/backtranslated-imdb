Every now and then, a group of friends with a minimal budget but full of enthusiasm and talent will create a low-budget masterpiece that takes the horror world by storm. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and pals managed with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his comrades, however, are destined to revel in relative darkness forever when Zombie Bloodbath is everything. A lesson on how to make a cheap horror serves this miserable effort (via a plague of carnivorous zombies) as a reminder that many people today have access to a video camera, but most should not use it. That's why why they should try to shoot a full length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets has no eye for a nicely framed shot (some of his camera angles and movements are really pretty good), but rather a) he has a lousy script, b) he has a lousy cast, and c) he does not realize he has a lousy script and cast. This means that the final film is extremely amateurish and is probably not seen by anyone but zombie filmmakers (like myself) or members of the cast and crew (like those who have commentated on the movie) in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at indiscriminate Gore-Hounds, and Sheets (who currently has an unbelievable 34 titles as a director) does the favor, with buckets and gore blood thrown at every opportunity. But though these moments are undoubtedly happy, they are not very convincing and quickly get boring. <br /> <br /> So, to sum it up, this is a really bad movie that has almost no redeeming qualities. Apart from two: <br /> <br /> First of all, this is the largest mullet in the history of the movie, as played by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The splendor of his barnet (paired with a spiky mustache) is the reason to watch this movie. Second, there are "miserable stealth zombies": carnivorous corpses waiting for unfortunate victims. Walk by before jumping out of hiding to launch a faint attack that requires almost no effort to escape. Famed for lurking behind a door for hours, waiting for someone to open it, 'pathetic stealth zombies' occasionally hide behind low walls or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie This bad thing would do 1/10 for me, but to celebrate the flowing lure of Jerry Angell, I'll generously increase my rating to 2/10.
