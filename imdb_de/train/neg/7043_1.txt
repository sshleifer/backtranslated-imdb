I was ready to laugh like a mystery science theater experiment throughout the movie, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many friends who loved biker and decided to make a movie from there. <br /> <br /> It is often unsurpassed. Many recordings of bikers driving on a dirt road, playing the same music repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is hardly in the movie. Harmon would probably have revived things. Maybe she had other responsibilities on the day this was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikers terrorize a small town. Fights, murder, a cowardly bull, a dumb mechanic, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a faint attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws. The script has nothing to offer. A scene shows a biker attacking a woman and screams into the lady's face: "They are all the same! They are all the same!". We return to the scene a minute later and he again declares "They are all the same!". Could not the author come up with something more creative? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys killed the bad guys. We also hear that the wedding between mechanic Joe middle-aged and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and we learn abruptly that Joe's wedding is still going on (but with another bride). The End.
