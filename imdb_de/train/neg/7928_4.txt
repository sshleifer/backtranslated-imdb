Actually, the movie is neither horror nor sci-fi. With a very strong Christian-religious theme, this film delivers minimal content and no tension. Second-class actors read halfway decent work reading their boring roles. The only good performance is from Sydney Penny, who plays a mother role. I will not spoil the movie, either Christ or Anti-Christ. Only watch this movie if you are a Christian religious fanatic obsessed with the Apocalypse. As a non-Christian, I had to force myself to see this movie just because I wanted to write this post. It is a pity that the sci-fi channel had to broadcast this movie for the main evening time.
