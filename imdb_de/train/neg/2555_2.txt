This movie is probably one of the most terrifying horror movies I've ever seen. The length was not nearly long enough to contain a good plot. The way the foster parents died was just ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies from a fall after stumbling over an action figure, and the father is shot dead by a police officer. I can see where some originality could be, what they intended to do, but it could have been better. In addition, the cheese factory made me want to press Stop before it was over. After hearing all about Lucy's name and finding out that it was "Lucifer," I wanted to choke. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It is a male name. It should be given a male character. All in all, the movie was boring and could have used a better plot.
