Filmatography: Excellent, beautiful camera angles (I can not remember having recently seen a movie with good close-ups). Could have avoided cruel scenes with a soft camera. NY is well represented. I liked the inverted angles, in particular (another note). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. Songs are not remembered even after watching the movie. Maybe I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actor: Kamal is slowly getting rid of hard core sequences. His age and his belly are really showing. He should also avoid close romantic sequences taking place in the future. It was very awkward to see a mature / older star still trying to play like the scenes of over 20 heroes. Love can be expressed at any age; As we get older, you can still express love from afar (without touching a woman too much, for example, the love that Rajinikanth expresses in "chandrmukhi"). Jyotika appears only for the namesake in the movie. Not sure why she accepted that. Well, that's not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to outdo his other movie "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. The release of the film took a long time due to various issues. He glides in a few scenes. Even horrible things were taken from a famous director. <br /> <br /> All in all, just a good movie. Too much graphic. FINALLY not for children (and adults who expect a kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
