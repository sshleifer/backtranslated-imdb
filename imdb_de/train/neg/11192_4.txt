This movie did not really impress me. Originally it was called Sin Eater and should have stayed that way, considering that in the last half of the movie everything was addressed. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do with the rest of the movie. It was very slow and what had to do with Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say, check this if you are dealing with things that deal with the Catholic religion, but do not expect exorcist or stigmata from this movie. It will surely flop after a few days and the message will come out.
