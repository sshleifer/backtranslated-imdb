I saw this in the marketplace of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheap product - nothing wrong with it, but you have to make up for it with some sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor. Well done for the producers who allegedly captivate them. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the run-down spaceship is hilarious - you could imagine all hands of the crew shaking around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish the people who did that well - at least that's not presumptuous.
