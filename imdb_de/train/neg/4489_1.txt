"The Matrix" was an exciting summer blockbuster that was both visually stunning and provocatively curious in its "Twilight Zone" style. This is the general rule - and this sequel does not match its predecessor. Worse than that, it is not even comparable. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes in the most unprofessional way on the screen. In the first few seconds, the first impression is generally good, as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately afterwards, the movie dives off. After a catastrophic first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum as they enter the Matrix and the fight against Agent Smith takes place. However, with the 14-minute chase sequence, it loses speed and gets worse at the end of the big groaning turn. Worst of all is the extra-long 'Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the storyline, it is also a pitiful excuse for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix 'was a good match, but in' Reloaded 'they use it too boringly. In the first case, there were interesting twists, but here it is too linear to be interesting from a distance. The film is basically just a series of stylish distractions that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on the wrong principle that bigger is better. It seems as if "The Matrix" franchise quickly invaded the special effects caused by other franchises, such as the "Star Wars" saga. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is mostly bad. Of course, the best character goes to Hugo Weaving's "Agent Smith" - the only one who is interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive neo, but with all special effects there is little room to make a big impact. Oscar nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss's role as an action girl could have been much better for any other actress. <br /> <br /> The poor movie "The Matrix Reloaded" is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first barely flock there. This is only for diehard fans. Even in its own subgenre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.), this is still pretty bad. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10.
