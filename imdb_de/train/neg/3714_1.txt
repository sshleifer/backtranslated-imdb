This film is a rewrite of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie titled "Heaven Can Wait," but written for Mr. Rock's uncompromising stand-up style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before the end of his life and enters into a contract with the representative of God, Mr. King, to come to earth as someone else. Like in Beatty's movie; He chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man, just because he imagines Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) accidentally appearing in Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake, and the idea of ​​turning an old white multimillionaire into a black comedian trying to get Sontee excited does not work. Even the intermediate cuts that were used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the actual "white" Wellington fail miserably. The original Beatty storyline - which in itself did not masterfully represent the idea of ​​life after death - could have been improved, but they certainly were not found in Down To Earth.
