Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are actually "so bad that they're good," and Zombi 3 is not only bad, it's miserable , unforgivable in many ways so bad that a whole new language is needed to describe them all. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is a film attributed to Lucio Fulci, who even by his standards does not have any Has coherence, sense or reason. However, we can not blame Fulci because it was not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have Fulci's sense of style to carry the film. Mattei seems to have contributed little to the film, but amazing inability. <br /> <br /> So I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features - in a well-known genre For thin characters, faint stories, and lack of film knowledge, Zombi 3 expresses the boat, but it's even weirder than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The "action" begins when the "Death 1" gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in flight. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military believe that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and more are not answered in Zombi 3 ... After the infected thief hides in a hotel, he is driven crazy by all the green plasticines that grow on his face before he is tracked down by the army Having foolishly found the best way to eliminate their corpse, it will be to burn them and send "Death 1" into the atmosphere, resulting in ... Zombie Birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombie people !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why do not the zombie birds just attack other birds?) Then we meet our "heroes", a trio of horny GIs and a whole bunch of girls. There are also a few other people, but they are not important - here, ONE is important. It's hard for you to remember someone's face, not to mention his name, or to find a reason to take care of him. In the end they hide in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago the hotel was full of life, now it's buzzing with flies!"), But there's no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> So far you are either completely sucked in or you have turned off the damn thing. The script is so horrible that even the best drama in the world could not save it. So it's good that they have some of the worst - not just the human characters, but the zombie who plays here is an all-time low. There are no consistent behaviors of how the zombies behave - some dodge themselves in the time-honored style, others engage in fist fights or fight machetes, not to mention the zombies who can still talk (one Bauble that gives the movie to TWIST TREASURING END). They die from shots on the chest (and not on the head) and are even knocked out by a good left hook. How can you throw a zombie out? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on badly done '80s action is often a consequence of a v ... <br /> <br /> The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding and seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous areas for the chance , some arms juice will pass and get the fear of her life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water and even among pregnant women. Once a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat them? No! To push her into the water, those zombies and her crazy humor! <br /> <br /> However, there are loads of gore. Limbs are hacked, wounds gush from green pus, and meat eats a lot, and people get a face hit in the head. There is nothing that matches the eyeball piercing of the originals, but if bad make-up effects are your bag, you will not be left down. <br /> <br /> All this and I did not even mention the terrible music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose actors actually manage to be really REALLY bad, or the deterrent punchline ... In a genius Turn of the original radio station, which is overrun by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie DJ! "He went to her side!" Our escaped cry of the hero before he vowed to continue fighting the undead in a sequel that unfortunately never came to that. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is garbage - it would not be a loss to the world if every single pressure destroyed records would be erased from its existence, but somehow I feel that my life is richer because I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
