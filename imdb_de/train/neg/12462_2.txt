I saw this movie from many sources last night after many good reviews. I would like to point out that you will hate this film if you are not ready to continuously try to find out who is who and what that means. <br /> <br /> I Still Have Difficulties Understanding the Actors' Roles In this movie, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really get used to the roles. <br /> <br /> For political curious and those who are interested in corruption in other world governments, this film is probably quite good, but for the average film observer this movie is awkward, in some places very boring and you will Cinema confused and upset that you have paid the entrance fee 100% on every detail or policy interest that interests you. Do not see it, if you really like watching movies.
