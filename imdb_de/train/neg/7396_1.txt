Unfortunately, I must agree with the criticism of halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film, the cinematography, costumes, sets, tone, cut and everything else are very good. This may seem surprising at first glance, but I was told that the technical crew who worked on it consisted of professionals, so the quality is expected. The problem is as usual in the story itself. <br/> <br /> The thing is, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the cinema, show a story), you need plot and conflict. They need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason can not understand. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural being who observes humanity. That's it. What we have here is pure representation. Instead of being shown a story, let's just learn about this Tim Watcher individual. Given the nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is of course difficult to convey enough background knowledge about him, so the film uses voice over narration. In this case it is used in the worst sense, ie to give information that we would never read about otherwise. If the VO was not for the VO, we'd think the character was just a crazy old man walking around looking at things. In addition, the VO also explains what is happening on the screen. The pictures we see are just a trinket for the text we hear. <br /> <br /> I could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something, but because the pictures do not sound. It is impossible to say that. What's left is obviously a measure of the crew's technical abilities (not unbelievable but good), but it's not entertainment, entertainment, thrills, or at least a story.
