I had expected something really good in this matter, but after the damage that affected me so much, I'm just glad to think. It's hard to believe what the filmmaker (HA!) Was for a good movie. The stories, and I loosely use the world, are incoherent and make no sense at all. It's just stupid things that happen by accident. Acting, if you can call acting, is terrible. I saw how the dough works in toy advertising! I know it's a low-budget garbage bin, but it's not as it was tried. Will after stopping thinking I feel very sleepy and # yawws # do, I'll lie down. <br /> <br /> WARNING: Do not attempt to drive, walk, read, or look after CHILLER'S OTHER SIDE INFLUENCES MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ONE OR ALL METAL FEATURES.
