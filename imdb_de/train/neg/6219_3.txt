When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at the Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to believe that it would be as heartwarming as some of the first Lassie movies. Not. <br /> <br /> The story was miserable, the songs of the Sherman brothers were far below their usual level, the characters were uninspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both had seen much better days br /> I was also interested the contribution of ALICE FAYE, since she was not on screen for so many years and was always so vociferous in her previous roles at Fox. Alice too was disappointed by the stupid script and unflattering photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original, nothing that is accessible to an adult remotely - and of course no magical gift for everyone. You can skip this without missing out on anything.
