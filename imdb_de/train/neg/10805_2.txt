The only reason I was able to digitize this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq now plays basketball for us and 2. I've always heard how awful it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were good as well as everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just got twisted and could not look at the screen when Shaq started raping and we kept wondering why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But it's terrible that we just could not stop watching it, the story drew you in, like a black hole or a quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the laugh and just to say that we actually saw "Kazzam".
