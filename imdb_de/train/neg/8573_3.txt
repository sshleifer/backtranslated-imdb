I do not like Sean Penn's direction very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it is colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian dichotomy that sincerely spoils most of Penn's work, his latest work even more than the earlier ones. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seems to produce such a fundamentally banal product, supposedly in some fidelity to honesty, but they are mostly glorified pro-wrestling matches and almost as moralistic when Hallmark Cards are a series from Hell's Angels regards, and I longed for the days of salvation, which is a good movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much more credible here than the ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's it. The film is dead, meaningless and seems to be an exercise, a set of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, who proves that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this crap of the Indian runner.
