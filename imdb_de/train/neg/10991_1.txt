My brother is an avid DVD collector. He glanced at the cover (two models on toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him and watched what turned out to be probably the most scary movie (I use that term loosely) that I felt compelled to sit through. I did not dare to seek eye contact with my brother. I was sure he must have cursed the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the entire movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in a scene that the "filmmaker" decided to show every take (about four in total) throughout the movie. In fact, the whole movie follows this suit. The fact that the DVD contained deleted recordings was a shock. (I left without going to bed though). Not surprisingly, I found this CD about a week later without housing behind the TV.
