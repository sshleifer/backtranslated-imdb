From the thoughts of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of film slime. Probably based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only resemblance to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (although there are dinosaurs in Africa that our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes! ) some characters with the same name. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) search for a treasure armed only with a medallion and land exactly where the treasure is pure chance. On the way they meet a colorful assortment of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a scream. That's the only reason I did not give a 1.
