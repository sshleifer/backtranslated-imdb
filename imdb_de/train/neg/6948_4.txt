An interesting idea (four African-Americans avenged under the shoe soles of the company taking revenge on bank robbery) is ruined by the terribly slow direction of F. Gary Gray and a tortured screenplay (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments , Instead of giving a sharp commentary on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men brutally abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford, and Lanier prefer their unsuspecting audience to high-profile performances of operatic drags to beat. It's melodrama in its worst form. Gray lets his actors linger over any tired line, and John Carter's lazy cut refuses to catch up on the slack, instead focusing his camera on the puzzled faces of the performers. And they are amused: Although actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have a raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand than Gray's to lead them As a result, they appear shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Control clearly.
