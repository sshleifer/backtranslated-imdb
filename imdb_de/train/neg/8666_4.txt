This thriller produced on television does not speak much. It's hard to put up with its intricate plot, but the writing is so messed up that the show is still cloudy at best. In the end I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. There is a quasi "Ten Little Indian" scenario, which, however, is favored halfway in favor of Sally Field and revealing a murderer. Field is acting with a cruelty that I rarely saw of her. The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly goes off course and is eventually exaggerated. Much hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects (which does not add anything). A strange mistake of the producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. Could they no longer give us all that talent as a script full of red herrings and Sally Field hiding in a closet?
