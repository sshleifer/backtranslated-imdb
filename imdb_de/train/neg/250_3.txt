After seeing three other versions of the film, I fear that this is the weakest by far, mainly due to the rather dull and leaden performance of Scott. His feelings are so mild throughout that it's hard to get involved in the movie. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at its center, it does not feel that Scott says dialogue with much conviction, and if he undergoes his metamorphosis, he is similar unconvincing. I can not think of any actors in this movie who match the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and, frankly, the Muppets) picks it up better. Very disappointing.
