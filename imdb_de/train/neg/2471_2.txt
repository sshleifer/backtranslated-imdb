I remember when I was little, when I was in the camp and we would camp under the stars. There was always someone who had a good story to tell about the woods that surrounded us, and they would always sneak me out. When I found Wendigo in the library, I looked at it and hoped to be one of those films where it was supernatural to persecute people in the woods, much like the stories told in the camp. Well, to my great dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three drives to their winter lodge, which looks like a normal townhouse and is nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they encounter a deer. Well, it looks like the local rednecks are chasing this stag and are pretty excited at our townspeople. The movie spends far too much time tracking the family's daily activities instead of getting to the point of the movie. Only in the last 15 minutes did we really have something to do with "Wendigo". My suggestion is that you keep this movie very far. You will leave your one and a half hours.
