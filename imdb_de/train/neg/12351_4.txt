A recent post by a woman referring to a military background contained the commentary "A woman's life is no more valuable than that of a man". <br /> <br /> This mantra of the politically correct does not apply to history to show biology. The societies have managed to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes at astonishing speed. Germany was ready to wage another war in 1939, despite the war from 1914 to 1918, during which more than two million of her men were killed. In South America's Triple Alliance War (1865), Paraguay took over three neighboring countries until virtually all of its male population was extinguished, but remained in the Chaco war of 1932 against the much larger Bolivia to a stalemate. No society has or could, however, the loss of their female population to survive. Only when the life of the nation is at stake are women sent to battle. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but ever since, despite the popular image of the Israeli soldier, it has never counted on co-combat units for its forces. "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood fluff.
