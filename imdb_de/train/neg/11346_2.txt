Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" on THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to view this movie. The story is very thin, and once the Air Force friends return to the States with a Cobra curse, the action is just a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
