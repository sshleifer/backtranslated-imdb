Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orchestra ... come on!). Acting is ... well, there is no acting! <br /> <br /> There is a man who actually goes to the forest to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> The killer is a fat man , unconventional clown who could not escape a turtle! <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is stupid and the director effortlessly puts all the clich√©s of the Slashers films into the film. <br /> <br /> The end is the stupidest thing ever made. Think about it: The guy (Ken Hebert) whose acting abilities play roughly the same role as he (he is the head behind the flop) invites a colleague and two of his friends into his cabin for a weekend and kills them , On Monday morning he goes back to his office as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert is trying to make us believe it's a family affair that lasts for the generation (his uncle is the clown killer). <br /> <br /> So NO cops will question him after his colleague is missing ... <br /> <br /> WHATEVER. <br /> <br />
