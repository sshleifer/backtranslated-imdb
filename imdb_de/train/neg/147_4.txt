"Valentine" is another horror movie that can be added to the list of stalk and slash movies (think of "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," "Scream," and "I know what you did last summer "). It's certainly not as good as the movies I've listed, but it's better than most rip-offs that came out after the first "Friday the 13th" movie. One of those films was the Canadian "My Bloody Valentine" in 1981, which I hated very much. "Valentine" is a better movie than this, but it does not say much. The plot: A nerdy little boy is annoyed and insulted by some of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the movie moves years later, when these classmates are grown up, and then individually recorded. It is believed that the killer is the boy who is now very mature and looking for revenge. But is he? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a dull script does not really do them justice. However, there are some scary moments. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
