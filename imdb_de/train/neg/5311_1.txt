This is almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently removing the rug for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called "Cheepnis." It looks like the space scenes were about to be demolished in a 50s power plant. The music is really shitty. The acting is made of wood and ham. The characters they represent are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is obvious and obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the direction begs the faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if you only know what one of the biggest waste of a tiny budget has to be. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!
