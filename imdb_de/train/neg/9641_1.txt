If you see this movie, you're either a Fred Olen Ray fan, you found it in Suncoast's $ 4.99 shelf and thought, "What do I have to lose?", Or you turned your eyes closed in the video store and rented the first movie you touched with your finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has everything a horrible movie needs: a script with breathtaking dialogues and intriguing detours in the plot, crazy science with psychic aspects and other dimensions, continuity seemingly flowing through wormholes in space and time, actors not just made of wood but also made of wood seems to border on a confused, unfounded nudity (not all that you would necessarily ask for) and of course a 5 'monster, played by one I suppose is Fred Olen Ray's child , <br /> <br /> Below, however, there is something that resembles a heart - as if Mickey and Judy had decided to bring together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct! Yes!) We can use red color from my movie Johnny's dad hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can trade in it!). <br /> <br /> Watch the Blooper roll over the credits - you'll learn why the final movie is cut so shitty. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... the Alien Force is also worth a look, but it does not. I have the same pleasantly crappy veneer as this one.
