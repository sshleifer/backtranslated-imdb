This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I am not joking. It was done badly and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could put together on their own. The case in which the movie came is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It seems as if the director or make-up artist has taken a look at the eyeliner black eyeliner and called it a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the film take almost 20 minutes. Which was the reputation of the credits was the best part of the film. This was a horrible movie, honestly, and I could not believe how bad it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes you were like, "What's up?" The audio was awful and the action footage looked like a couple of teens making a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> IF you want to rent or buy a movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how horrible it really is. I wish I had seen it before I rented it.
