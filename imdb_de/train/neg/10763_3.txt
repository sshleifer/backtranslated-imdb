First of all, what's good in the movie? A pretty actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh during acting (would I have if I had been in their situation)? I dont know. The plot is simple: A Catholic priest doing abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest in his youth ...). I'm afraid there's nothing to learn or a bit of serial killer, art or religion to think about here. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "Profiler" (the series) with substitute actors and unbelievable coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who could have a baby with the priest, the girl who lives in the house of another victim, etc.) , etc).
