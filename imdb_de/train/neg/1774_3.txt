Okay, I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago at 9am on Cinemax and thought it was an award winning one. This movie has bitten the big one. I mean, the monster's mother shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I go "That's it, why does not she show it a little earlier in the movie." The act, which is mother and son, enjoys the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they just kept going, you know, a killer spree killing like a couple of young women, then finding the sheriff or a cop and finding the old ones to kill the monsters the young woman save young women and have one or two more people killed? I think that would be much better this way. It's shit, too, because the son is the main character and he's killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? And how does she have this power at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said it herself, she was too weak. What the hell was going on with Stephen this time? I can never rule out the acting of an actor in any movie, after all they try their best. If it was not a good acting, I would have given this movie a 1/10. 10.3.
