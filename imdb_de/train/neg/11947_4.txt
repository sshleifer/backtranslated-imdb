An interesting change from the first one. This movie had more puzzles than the first one. Even when it ends, you wonder what happened, who the killer was. There are some good parts in the movie, the first half starts slowly and in the last half the tempo starts to pick up again. All in all, the movie is pleasant. The story is 22 years after the events of the first film. Norman Bates is out of the asylum and back to Bates Motel, but when a woman shows up claiming to be his true mother, things go awry. Perkins plays well for an old Norman and the scene at the end was excellent, he swung this spade terribly hard.
