I saw this movie in the middle of the night as I was leafing through the canals and nothing else to see. It's one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but after twenty minutes or so, you can not turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies somewhere in between is so bad that it's good and so bad that it's good, just BAD. Great in the middle of the night, if only for the fabulous tennis track. Do not even wonder why nobody can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously male because the logic is not correct.
