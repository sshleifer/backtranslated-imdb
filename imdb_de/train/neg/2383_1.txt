This is a candidate for the most disappointing movie experience of my life. Cool title, excellent director (I've seen "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before) and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you be wrong? Well, that's a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after seeing this turkey. Disjointed and inglorious in an attempt to be unmoved, this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. The critical lambasting was earned. You have one of those rare movies here that does not contain any quality of redemption. Zero out of ****.
