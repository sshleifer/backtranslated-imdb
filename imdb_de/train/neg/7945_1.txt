The film confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that at no level does it lead to coherent arguments against the death penalty. By presenting the legitimate execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film turns the parental murderer into a martyr for Christ. According to the conspiracy, God is somehow outraged that society has decided to free himself from a fanatic who killed his own parents by setting them on fire while sleeping helplessly in their beds. But the same God has no indignation over the murderer's deeds. The lead actor, a non-religious pregnant, suicidal woman, gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully rescue this convicted murderer. In other threads of underdeveloped conspiracy, Jesus returns as an impotent and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern, lackluster incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes him, but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions. Unable to influence mankind forever, he skeptically walks the boundaries of life, waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself, with little help from Jesus, able to reincarnate herself into her newborn, soulless child who saves all mankind from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpreted that as an explanation to support abortion on some levels. This film, which attempts to interweave many religious themes into a thriller, does not claim a religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it never tries to answer. She disregards the religious values ​​of her audience and tries to present an incomplete version of her fulfillment. Stupid
