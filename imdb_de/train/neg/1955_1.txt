This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and gets ridiculous. I actually wanted to see "Darkness Falls" and thought that this is the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I reeled as far as I could and still could not get rid of those boring moments. I just envy the people who were paid to star in this movie or work on it. They were actually given money for this crap. Is not that amazing? I mean, in this movie a man is killed and chopped into small, bloody pieces in a wood mill, and a few minutes later mother and child talk quietly at the table while nothing has happened and drink coffee. You're welcome! Come on! Who gives money for such crap films? Oh, and the "Tooth Fairy" was lame. Not scary and it was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made makeup.
