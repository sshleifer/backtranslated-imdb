I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy it. But I do not really understand the point "Envy". I mean, it has a boring content / theme, and it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> Although the show is generally good, it's not enough that the movie is at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So if you want to rent a comedy, you should definitely opt for it. Unless you want to get bored, and I can see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, even Jack Black apologized (look at Trivia).
