Wow, a movie about NYC politics, apparently written by someone who has never set foot in New York City. You know there is a problem if you expect the credits to run and the movie will run for another half hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous and the plot moves between boring and ridiculous. A terrible movie.
