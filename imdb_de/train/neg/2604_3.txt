Doppelganger has his moments, but there are very few. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a mix of pop psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is being persecuted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered and was the prime suspect in at least one case), or has she just a really bad case with multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is her new roommate, and most of the action is about him. <br/> <br/> Newbern's character is quite likeable, and both he and Barrymore do decent work (though not very well). The mediocre to (sometimes) totally disgusting script and unassuming directing seem to forget the rest of the performance. Leslie Hope's character is memorable but so irritating that you want to forget her. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually breaks down into a bipartite (narrative narrative is psychological realism, the other is a supernatural horror) whose climax is so poorly conceived, acted and photographed that it accounts for most of what the Film had previously achieved, effectively counteracts. Overall, the film has the feeling that the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first could be a bachelor class. The acting and the script for the two leads are just good enough to take care of her a bit - at least until the film completely derailed. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your lookalike, but avoid a first step-person encounter
