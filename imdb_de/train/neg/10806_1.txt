If you are a fan of really bad movies and find fun, you will be the great spectacle of Shaq. First of all, professional players rarely put in movies. Shaq was the worst actor I've ever seen, alongside Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad movies. Anyway, this movie is also bad because of the vile child. I would give this a zero, but that's impossible.
