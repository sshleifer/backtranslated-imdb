I saw this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb and even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie". I wanted to like this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was pretty bad. If the story was about a young man who fell in love with a girl who had parasomnia, it would have been a better movie. <br /> <br /> The support center extended credibility far beyond the borders, in fact it was pretty ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse walks into a room for the routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without escorts), drops the tray and runs screaming out of the room for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the villain of the movie) is fully clothed standing - apparently for years? None of that makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The movie even had some actors that I liked in other things, like the detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
