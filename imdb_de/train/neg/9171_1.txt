What can I say? I ignored the reviews and looked at it myself. Damn the reviews were so right. What a waste of money considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Well, I've seen Kill Bill after this movie. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, Crossroads would be! br /> <br /> Conclusion-- I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this crap.
