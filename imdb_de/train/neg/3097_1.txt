There can be no question of spoilers for this movie, the director has beaten us all and spoiled the movie in so many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant rip off of things like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to regain the humor and horror of these better-made films. This leads to a wasteful waste of time, in which bad actors lead bad dialogues in front of an idiotic director, occasionally throwing stuffed animals at them. They wrestle with the toys in the same way old Tarzan films used rubber crocodiles, shaking them as they screamed and tried their best to make it seem threatening. It's painful to look at and not supported by the mental fashions of the 80's cast by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been caught by an aging watchman in a film lot, after a long time finally free years of captivity, and start turning around telepathically with people's minds. The new recruit of the guards, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, brings his group of friends from the '80s together and they set out to do little adventures as they try to retake the Grem ... Hobgoblins , <br /> <br /> All life is here, with a gang consisting of a Knucklehead jock, his' 80s slut girlfriend, the cool and squeamish girlfriend of the hero, and the young hero who lacks self-confidence and he wishes his girlfriend would get out anyway. First comes the infamous fighting scene, in which the former military jock shows how he was trained in the army to become a tyrant who pushes the nerdy hero for hours at the wrong end of a rake. Then some run around and end up in a real pie-fighting style that ends in a seedy nightclub and uses comedy hand grenades to shoot everything but the people in the air. Then the movie ends and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. It's like seeing a train at the wreck, you can not take your eyes off it, it's so bad. Perfect for the Mystery Science Theater, but terribly you should try to watch it alone and uncut. The fashion police still have a number of outstanding warrants for occupation, and I dare everyone not to laugh out of ridicule over the rake fight. On a good day, a maximum of 2 out of 10 points are achieved.
