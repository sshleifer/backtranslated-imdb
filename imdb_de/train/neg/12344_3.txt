A torn comedy, a sketchy revue that was initially a vehicle to present the former radio star Jack Pearl, but which is best remembered as America's introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are charged alongside Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his three Stooges. Although in the minor cast Jimmy Durante (who is completely wasted with idiotic material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only spectators for the film these days are Stooges addicts, and even they will not find much applause here. Incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far Hollywood has had to go to achieve a degree of slapstick sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
