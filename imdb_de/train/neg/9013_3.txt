It's hard to praise this movie very much. The CGI for the kite was well done, but lacked the proper modeling for light and shadow. The same footage is used endlessly with the kite stomping through corridors, which gets a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to have seen "Marcus Aurelius" in the actors, and wondered what a former Emperor of the Roman Empire would have been Empire has made in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg," it must be an alias, and you can blame it for appearing in that stinker. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the acting is shallow and the direction is boring. If you MUST see this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk - it's fun.
