This is a movie that shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, in the thirties, the spectator was treated to lots of beautiful scenes of Los Angeles - I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram going up the hill - but in a sense, this is fine Camera self-destructive, because it creates a mood that "something will happen" - and does nothing. Also, the script always acts in the direction of a conspiracy, an action or a trauma - and again and again not. Not even the (I suspect) theme of the movie, the inappropriate role of the characters. The lead actors, who were both too pretty for their roles, did not bring repression or agony, and the script did not tell us. <br /> <br /> Well, Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well trained, so perfectly played, that I wanted the camera to follow him.
