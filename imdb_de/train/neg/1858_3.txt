A serial killer dies in a blizzard and is mutated into the evil twin of Frosty the Snowman. Then it goes to a murder rush. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. When you are five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw it on the cable and am glad that I have not paid any money for it. It has all the charm and style of a low budget movie that can become a cult movie. I am sure that it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not there. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes that I found amusing. Like the bathtub scene and the post-explosion scene with the Picasso reference. It was also nice to see how many heroes try to kill Jack and he just does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie horror.
