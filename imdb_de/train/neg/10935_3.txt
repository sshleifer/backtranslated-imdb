I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. As a Mormon, I always felt that the sense of humor in the LDS community was too exclusive and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I had hoped that this would be the fresh breeze, the Halestorm movie that I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought Since this had B-list talents like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), this would have to be a bit funny at least. In addition, the basketball in the church is ripe with potential for many funny gags and the like. But I have to say, throughout the movie it seemed like nobody knew what they were doing. Every joke failed, and every opportunity for a really funny gag was ignored. The dialogue was boring and the movie had one of the worst character developments I've ever seen. Every single character except Wilson's was less one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that after nine rewrites, the film was still as staggeringly stale as the train I've experienced. I can not put into words the anger that made me feel. My friends and I were allies in the last game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I have to say, I avoided any contact with him after the show. He was waiting at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that not only did his movie tear away one and a half hours of my life, but it also left an unpleasant, painful scar I'll never forget. <br /> <br /> Here I have had some specific problems: Between the janitor and the chubby pianist there was a little love story, but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care for, leaving my friends and me Ever wondered why we should do that to take care of these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were plenty of subplots that appeared from time to time, and everyone promised the audience the chance to laugh, but everyone came and went in a cloud of smoke before he could start looking after them. That's how the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a big flop and I feel bad for anyone expecting the first really funny Mormon movie. True, the jokes in this case are not too exclusive for Mormons. On the other hand, it's hard to say what a joke was and what a loud ringing in my ears was. <br /> <br /> Please do NOT watch this movie. Keep the imagination in mind that this movie is hilarious. Spare yourself the disappointment that I went through
