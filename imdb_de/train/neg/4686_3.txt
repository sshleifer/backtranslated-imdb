There were good performances by Robin Williams and others, but the film was boring overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a serial killer who bored people to death: an abandoned guy Ugly clothes chasing his victims around food courts, Oprah quotes, reciting his medical history until they implore him to shoot. <br /> <br /> I think the film is especially appealing to ego-nomes who think strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers to want a break from the customers.
