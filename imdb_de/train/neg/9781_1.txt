I do not think I'm too far from the grassroots and say that this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I've worked on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai" (all black and white), all good deeds, rich characters, and great acting. I've seen better dialogue and acting in student-written High School One Acts. However, the plot is not a bad condition - only poorly implemented. It's a bit of a traffic accident, I could not turn it off! A movie does not need big money or big sets, d. H. "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is no excuse. What did they think?
