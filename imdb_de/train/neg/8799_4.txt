Kudos to Paul Muni, who spent hours every day in the make-up room to see Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today - except classic movie fans - know about it at all. He was a giant in the industry for at least a decade. He could have won the Oscar for this achievement, which would have given him two consecutive years, having won him for Louis Pasteur the previous year. My own opinion is that even though he tended to do a little too much, he still thinks he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Whatever role he played; They were tied to the screen watching him. <br /> <br /> Contrary to Pasteur's role, I thought this story screwed up a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: Overlapping a Liberal Hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its contempt for the police or the military, and it should be noted how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers simply love when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this movie is way ahead of its day since we saw this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it must be pointed out that the facts support this story. In no way does it diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer by eliminating certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that than focusing on a process.
