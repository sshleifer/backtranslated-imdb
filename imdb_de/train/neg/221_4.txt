I was gifted with this film because it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women who fell in love with one who fell in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Fascinating. <br /> <br /> NOT! I hurry to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive and conspiratorial and want to pull each other down. Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not go wrong in my book before they saw this. But here they are handed a bleak script and the action between slapstick and screwball balanced, which does not work well if the women are all known in a very small town professionals. <br /> <br /> And for smart women they spend a good deal of time complaining about the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that with a decent script and more excitement, much more could have been done, the lesbian negotiation went nowhere and those smoking / drinking women (all three in their forties) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screwed that up Baby, give me a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame for waste. 4 out of 10.
