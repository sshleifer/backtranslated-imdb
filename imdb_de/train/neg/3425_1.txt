I'll spend as much time on this review as the authors do the script. This is easily the worst sequel ever. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. The performance of Mark Blankfield was not just GOD-AWFUL, but everyone else! The physical comedy was forced to be flat and predictable. The script appeared to have been written by Mongoloid monkeys with the pseudonyms Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to express such vile cinematic exits is unclear to me. They even managed to make experienced actor Ray Walston look like a talentless buffoon. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes of my life spent in this daredevil memory of a brilliant comedy to convince everyone involved in this cinematic atrocity.
