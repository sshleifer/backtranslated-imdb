This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is absolutely no story, the gags are just for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that makes this movie worth seeing. Throughout the movie, Fredi (oh my god, what a weird name, Ha ha) DOES NOT ask himself how he got on a plane to the middle earth. There are many stupid and completely listless characters whose names should sound funny. e.g. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam means Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile during the whole movie. The gags seem like they're made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is locked in the door (this happens about five times), maybe this movie is for you. Another funny scene: you try to guess the codeword for a closed door (do not ask why - never ask why), and the codeword is (ha ha): dung. So if you laughed at these examples, you might like this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and look at "Lord of the Weed": it's much, much more fun.
