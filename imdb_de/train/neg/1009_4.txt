*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie on Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman with it. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a would-be journalist who stumbles across a case that can lead to corrupt police officers in Edison's police force. LL Cool J is Deed, a police officer in the armed forces of a special party called F.R.A.T. (First reaction tactic). He has teamed up with a bad policeman named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we see Lazerov & Deed attacking some bank robbers, but at night they'll beat up some guys who use drugs. I do not want to give away too much, but it will be bad for the people who are taking drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a trial with Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects a bad game and performs with the help of Ashford investigations, which are ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), all within the F.R.A.T. Team joins forces with Ashford to try and bring the corrupt police to justice. <br /> <br /> You can say right from the start that the performance of Freeman and Spacey is pretty lackluster. The only person who offers a complete performance is Dylan McDermott. He is an absolute nut case in this movie and made me believe. LL Cool J is awful in this movie. He says every line in the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. He was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with a nice action, then pulls it through the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
