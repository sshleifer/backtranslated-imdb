and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the author had never seen a horror movie and did not know that everything he wrote was a cliché and a curse word and was parodied to perfection in films like Scream and Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> Between the scary bits is the BANAL and BORING dialog that has ever been written. Stupid "we go to the prom" garbage. I wanted to scrape my ears off. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There really was no need to do this movie. The senior lady is uninteresting and I always thought, "You? Really? The guy is obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All characters look stupid, including the police. (Cover the square in groups of two! Front and back! Not a sleepy policeman sitting in his car and folding the window down, just waiting for his throat to slit.) The serial killer is just hanging around murdering everyone he does want, without the slightest problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). No one has any protection, or the slightest idea, to fight back (or beat the security lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like mentally handicapped sheep. <br/> <br/> If you are a fan, you will be disappointed too. All killings are kept off screen and - um - made tasty. (Boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is the least interesting. Most of the time they had already happened when we found out. <br /> <br /> The only cliché that was missing was the cat that always pops up in this kind of movie. "Oh Kitty, you scared me, I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And in the end, when the killer dies - let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snoring. <br /> <br /> The audience laughed and talked to the screen all the time. It was too stupid to believe and not really scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy filmmaking. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way - no coronation of a final king or queen, no tiara, no bucket of blood.) <Br /> <br /> So save your money and hire "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (each of them) to be scared of some original twists.
