This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw it at the premiere on the SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said so at the premiere. This is a drama, but people consistently laughed at how kitsch the movie was. That's never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Liviens roommate / bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took themselves too seriously. The cheesy discarding of the Beatles lyrics was simply absurd. The soundtrack, however, was excellent and was probably the best part of the movie. If you're not one of those crazy, daring Dominic Monaghan fans, do not worry.
