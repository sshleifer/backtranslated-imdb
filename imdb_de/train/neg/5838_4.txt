With an absolutely amazing cast and crew this could have been a classic. Instead, it is a repeated paraphrase of all the conspiracy theories that were plagued in 1979 about the assassination of JFK in a vague incoherent conspiracy over the murder of fictitious President Kegan in 1960 - enough to do so - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example are asked to go over the top - John Huston. However, Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to convince themselves in very different ways. <br /> <br /> The photography is great, but does not justify one and a half hours of your life or buy the price from the DVD.
