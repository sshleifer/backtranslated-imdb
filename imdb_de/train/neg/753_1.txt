Wow ... <br /> <br /> After reading online that it had been published earlier, I picked it up at the local Wal-Mart. I have been following this for some time online and just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think that what I really noticed was the cut or its lack. Again and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can switch between someone leaving point A to show that he arrives at point B. It is not necessary to show almost the entire journey! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I actually felt sorry for the actors involved. They do not seem to get instructions on what to do in scenes, except to look anxious or happy, depending on which action should be added at a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> Why it was decided to do almost all effects with CG is a mystery to me. Even ILM sometimes uses miniatures. One of Greenscreen's most distracting uses in this film is the constant running around of the same group of people representing the citizens of different cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these people come and go without regard to the angle of the shot or the distance they have from the camera. At one shot in London, at least two men seem to be over six feet tall, running just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). I have not seen such a fake facial hair since GETTYSBURG. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why did Timothy Hines talk about this movie the way he did it? It's a turkey, plain and simple. On the positive side (at least for me), it has delivered some of the most sincere laughter I've seen in a long time.
