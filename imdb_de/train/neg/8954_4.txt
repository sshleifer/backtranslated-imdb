I had high hopes for this movie because I liked the book so much. However, I do not believe that I would have understood the premise of the film if I had not already read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of the people trying to break the bonds of over-powerful government, but the book describes the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have a comfortable, almost luxurious life, while ordinary people struggle to survive for the bare essentials. Perhaps most people will feel that way towards their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are actually oppressed or oppressed or not. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. Several years have passed since I read the book, but in the media and occasional conversations there are frequent references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak. Many people who use these terms are unlikely to know where the terms come from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.
