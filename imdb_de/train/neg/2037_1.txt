If I could give it a zero, I would change my mind and give a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible movie without a movie plot, makes no sense for what happens. Just boring. Please do not waste your money on this. You're welcome !!! This movie could have worked so well if it had really portrayed the story of the Animal Killer, but well, I felt nothing but disgust when I saw him. Do yourself a favor and borrow some classic movies. It's better to watch a movie you've seen 3-4 times than this crap! I do not understand why people even make such films when they know that things are not going well. Zodiac Killer should instead be called 'Boriac Killer' !!!
