In over 70 years of film watching, this was one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have done some very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the run. <br /> <br /> It is irrecoverable from the beginning to the pinned scenes during the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, whom I usually like, must have needed her paycheck. She absolutely has to relearn her craft. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is) needs a better director to show him how he acts. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is not up to her role either. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find another character, he has made that same person a few times too many times. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard I started years ago as a top-notch actor, not as well as I used to. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent about what I can say about this film comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (from 4) points 25 (from 100) IMDb 1 (from 10)
