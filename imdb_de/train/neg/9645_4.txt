It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases and a huge hype that turns out to be a dud at the box office. London Dreams is no exception. Let's take it apart ... It's about chasing your dreams and how far you will go to reach it. Sounds impressive right? But unfortunately the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to grow up one day. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 spectators calling his name. He is accompanied by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a gorgeous Priya (Asin). Together they make "London Dreams" their dream band. After impressing the boss of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, whom he only wants to disclose when he reaches his destination. Then Arjun brings his boyhood friend Manjit Khosla alias Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirt who has no ambitions in life, to his band. Mannu is a trained musician and a true talent that later made Arjun jealous of Mannu's superior ability and affair with Priya. Arjun wants to plague Mannu with the help of Zoheb. What happens next forms the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> When it comes to technical aspects, we only feel the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha, whom we admired in Namaste London. I felt like he just visualized the script. In short, a glorified cameraman. Screenplay of Suresh Nair dull, though it has its moments. The script was defined in a predictable way, and you became too stiff. The camera work was fantastic to capture the beauty of London. It's the only entertaining part while watching songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are buzzing while others are passably loud. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he bothers you. Asin is forgotten and I do not know that she will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is absolutely OK. Brinda as a slut is what we have seen in countless films. Ompuri continues the process. I do not want to think about the shortcomings, as this will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me put it succinctly: London Dreams is a soulless movie that you can enjoy on DVD.
