This is a high quality cheese flavor of B-movie kung fu flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course let's show you short clips of Bruce and close-ups of his eyes. If you quint at a proper angle during the winter solstice during a certain time of the day, it looks like Bruce. They reverently laugh at the fact that film splicing is not very good, but some cool, deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by an arrow while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think that this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, even though his character should be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very BAD). See how Bruce walks one-to-one with the cowardly lion. The prop department has visited Kay-Bee. Bruce also does not mind brutally beating a crippled man. Towards the end, the director decided "Let's throw a flashback" for a scene that was shown just 3 minutes ago !! You must have thought that only single-celled organisms with attention deficit syndrome can fully understand this movie. <br /> <br />
