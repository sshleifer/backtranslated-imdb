this movie has its good points: hot chicks dying people <br /> <br /> the problem ... the hot chicks barley gets naked and you do not see many of the people dying, mostly just a lot of fast movements and screaming, though there are two gave good kill scenes. <br /> <br /> Even for those of you who see this for JENNA JAMESON, she's just a minor choreographer with a very minor role and minor-nude scenes /> What this movie needed ... script and story would be nice, but I will not complain about it. Simply put, it takes more nudity and better scenes to kill, because we have to look at it. That's why we watch those movies ... <br /> <br /> I would not waste my money ... and if you have to, wait until it's on the OLD shelves of your local video store
