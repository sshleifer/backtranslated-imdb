This is a decent job, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a little bit in the dark, which makes a zombie movie cool. No, they are not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually, I'm not sure if it's a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they're talking about. Anyway, instead of wasting your time animating a stupid ass, just throw more zombies and more action. 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs and some guys screaming about something. And to make matters worse (boring), most of the deaths occur outside the screen. I realize this is all too common for no-budget movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, kind of) that asked me why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) was up Concentrated the beginning of the epidemic - It's short, nobody cares anyway.
