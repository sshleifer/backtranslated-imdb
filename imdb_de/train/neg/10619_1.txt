... but a lousy movie. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... TOo serious! The plot is stupid and slow (something about old people who inhabit the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the movie is all talk speeches speeches speeches speeches speeches speeches speeches I've actually fallen asleep a few times! The movie is so boring! The Cast Sleepwalks go through this with the sole exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but that was probably a love affair for both of them (they often complained about too much horror movies ... well, that has NO power!) Avoid at all costs ... unless you have sleep problems ... you will be put to sleep!
