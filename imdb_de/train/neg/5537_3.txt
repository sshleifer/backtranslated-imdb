What? You did not know that Scooby-Doo fought zombies? Well, you may not know about this little movie staged by Victor Halperin, who shot White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably be the second zombie movie. No, do not look for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and do not even look for such brains are eaten. That's 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> What you will see is typical of this era - much talked about. <br /> <br /> You see Dean Jagger (Twelve O'clock) Clock and Bela Lugose's eyes, but that's about all. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!
