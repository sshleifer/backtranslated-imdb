Designed only to annoy (or amuse) intelligent individuals with self-esteem. If the director had the intention that the viewer does not like the title character, that would have been okay, but I know that there is no Hollywood director who criticizes any criticism of America's pro-Marxist movement of 60s no filmmaker from the 70s. There are so many idiotic dialogues here that sometimes I wonder if I did not actually see a comedy. You would not be guilty of believing that this is a satire? So naive is the movie. Spacek was in her share of Leftist films, which brings me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the Redhead Hick is one of those liberal idiots in Hollywood. But I mean, are not they all? Beautiful breasts, but shit for the brain.
