I may have seen worse movies, but I do not remember. Or possibly blocked. Who knows if I should undergo hypnotherapy, I may remember that as a child they were kidnapped by aliens or other traumas. If so, I'd like to share these memories with those I have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give some credit to the film: it has caused an emotional reaction. In fact, I got angry at scenes that have faked other movies and TV shows that this travesty soils them with associations. I am afraid that I might like films like Strangelove can not watch again, without this movie fluttering over my mind's eye.
