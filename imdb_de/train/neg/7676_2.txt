I was really surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad that I could hardly believe what I saw. There are no characters, just a few clich√©s that run around and get killed. The extent of character development gave each character a name and a profession, and that's it. There was no real action and none of the characters seemed to be motivated. In fact, many action scenes started on their own with a thundering techno track. As I watched this movie, I kept asking, "Where did that happen, what's going on?" Acting was high school drama, with stiff wood delivery, as if the actors were reading cue cards without understanding their lines. Your problems with providing lines have been made even more apparent by the awful sound design. ADR sounded like it had been recorded in an open space. The actors were always eager to meet their markers, looking almost robotic. These listless machines go through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without transitional scenes. They were here, now they are here. That's what happened, now it happens. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching. Definitely not worth nine dollars.
