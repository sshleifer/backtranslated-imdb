I am all for the idea of ​​a great epic of the American Revolutionary War. That's not it. (And by the way, it was not the Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT, but I digress.) <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie on an ad in the old MGM Studios (now Sony) came out. The audience had high expectations for this costly piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon and starring the esteemed Hugh Hudson (by CHARIOTS OF FIRE) starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it did not take long for people to squirm on their seats, and whispering, hideous comments on Pacino's terribly misunderstood accent - he was supposed to be an American Border Crosser of Scottish descent (!) - and Nastassja Kinski, who was recently emigrated to England (!!). Then the story started and it went downhill fast. <br /> <br /> Motivations were confused, dialogues were gruesome, events had no historical or political context. What was conspiracy wavered because of absurd chance; The second or third time that the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski had collided, it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an undisguised performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was also everywhere on the map. I suspect there were no English actors. <br /> <br /> Many people are left. Those who stayed tried to suppress the giggles, then laughed openly. I held it - I thought that at least the fight scenes could be good. I was wrong. For some inexplicable reason, Hudson decided to film them with handheld cameras, not even Steadicam. The jerking conveyed an inappropriate "authenticity" that worsened the scale. <br /> <br /> There was a semi-famous television reporter the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could see that he was upset by the behavior of us all. And, of course, the next day in his TV segment, he gave the film a '10' on its infamous 'Franklin scale of 1 to 10', while bizarrely talking about the spiders that had disturbed the movie the night before and the one clearly I did not know art when they saw it. What a buffoon. After this disaster, Pacino played no other film for almost four years. Hugh Hudson's career has never recovered. You can not say that I did not warn you.
