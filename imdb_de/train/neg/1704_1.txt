You would not expect such a movie to be good, and that's not it. It's a budget-less, ultra-violent zombie movie shot with a poor-looking handheld camera ... and it's weird. The actors have obviously never acted, as evidenced by their terrible, witty readings. There is no conspiracy to see. The little conspiracy that I could find seemed to be that a government experiment had fled and a group of zombies seemed to terrorize a few families. The gore effects are among the worst I've ever seen. It seems as if the gore effects are invading people in a butchery for all body parts, and many scenes include zombies that dismember people and eat their organs. It's a funny and sickly movie, and it's about as bad as you can expect from any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 min.
