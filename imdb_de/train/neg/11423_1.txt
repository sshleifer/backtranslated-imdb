What happened in the making of this film, so that it became a total mess? Only a year after "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant film with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire" (who looked more in the latter and acted as if they were still in high school Mavericks First.) But without the grip or discipline in the presentation of their roles. <br /> <br /> Was it the director or the writer? Since it is the same person (Joel Schumacher), it must be both. But then Schumacher gave us that. "The Phantom of the Opera", "Phone Booth," "A Time to Kill" and two that range from good to great directing Batman movies "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever". Something went wrong on "StEF" It has no genius, no comedy worth anything, and is very far removed from what is really valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Example: The figure Wendy (a rich little girl with a heart that does good and help the less fortunate, which is played by Mare Winningham), Billy reveals (a stubborn bitch, his wife and cheats on his friends and too much drinking) and has no feeling alright in his life, which is appropriately played by Rob Lowe), that she is still a virgin. Billy really sees a challenge and possible conquest, but Wendy "is not ready". Wendy is indeed not ready, it's hard to believe she's in this clique of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, whose wife left him, took his child and married another, he somehow pulled the strings of his life together. Billy travels to New York and leaves parental responsibility for his little daughter. He convinces Wendy that her virginity is the perfect gift for her. And Wendy, who works as a social worker to help broken families, does not seem to be graded at all by this despot. Give me a break. The only thing she can give is giving her to a loser who leaves his family and friends. Schumacher framed this scene as a wonderful and touching moment. <br /> <br /> There are many more examples where a complete separation between the real and thrown overboard the value is, and act the file as a virtue. 'I suppose some might say "those were the 80s," but I remember that the men, were made in the 80s responsible for the children they had fathered, whether in or out of marriage /> < br /> I think this movie is so bad because it is out of sync with what is really valuable and right. <br /> <br /> As for technology (not history), it was terribly good. It is incoherent and feels like a 3-hour movie edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and time jumps just do not make sense. Pick up what's in the cut room, put it back and the movie would probably run much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was over the head when writing or perhaps writing the script for St Elmo's Fire this group of actors set and went their own way - in my opinion that really happened.
