I also have some advice for the people who made this movie. If you make a movie like this, make sure you have the f / x as a backup. Do not be fooled by a bunch of Z list actors. Another thing, almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so do not copy it blatantly. All in all, this movie sucked, f / x, sucked, unoriginal story. Let's talk briefly about acting. The Carradine, whose career peaked in 1984 when he made "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). He is not exactly a Z list, he can act. He should have just said no. He should have done what Mark Hamill had done after the "return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made a name for himself as a "nerd" and that should have been. I understand he has to pay bills, but that hardly excuses this S-T bag. Did I call this movie that? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a bit hostile, I apologize. I wasted only 2 hours of my life, I could have done something more productive, such as: For example, when painting, and I feel betrayed. I will close on this point. Thanks for your time.
