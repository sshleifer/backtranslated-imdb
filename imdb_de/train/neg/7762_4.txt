Given that John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I probably had too high expectations because I was pretty disappointed. First, they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of ​​presenting his amazing knowledge to the public in a public space. After this scene, I was worried that it was just entertainment. The problem, however, is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story less intriguing. I was also a bit disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I realized he was not doing credible John Doe. Another problem was the police history. It really felt like Déjà Vu and it was not a pleasant sensation. This leads us to the worst problem in the group, the episodic format. I could already see how the fillers came in succession. So on the whole I was very disappointed and recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I now understand better why the show was canceled. Somehow I have the impression that it has missed its goal by developing characters that help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The production quality was also pretty good and the casting was correct. But I'll never know if it got better, probably not because I do not intend to watch the next episode.
