Chan Wook Park is nothing special. I AM A CYBORG, BUT THIS IS OK, is full of amusing little technical bells and whistles with some ingenious ideas strewn in between. Park tries to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), an imaginative, carefree story that represents a radical departure from its usual morbid price. Hardly any mistake can be made for his ambition or vision. It's really unexpected to see that all of Park's efforts add up so little over time they subtract of themselves, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are abundant and unusual humor, but it fails miserably to make a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and are played with enthusiasm by the performers, but I try to be interested in anything Park was a little too spoiled, but still managed to show some of the director's unique torches Following an impressive filmography, he was easily forgiven. None of the confident trust that COMMON SECURITY or SYMPATHY FOR MR has provided. VENGEANCE is obvious here. I'm a CYBORG, but that's OK, so completely disengaged me that I occasionally instinctively rewound myself (more regularly as the movie progresses). I gave LADY a 5/10, and that probably does not deserve more than a 3. For the sake of the old days I will be generous: 4/10
