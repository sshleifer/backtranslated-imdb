Well, without Ethel Waters and a seven-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (calculated here without the Jr.), Rufus Jones as President would be one of the worst portrayals of African-American stereotypes I've ever seen from the early Talkie era and would not be worth seeing been. Mrs. Waters is excellent here and sings "Am I Blue?" and "Below Our Harlem Moon," while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood showbiz experience prepared him for his adult superstar status. He is standing so well that for a while I thought he was a small person with decades of experience. So, if you're ready to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones should be good fun as president. P.S. Today is the fourth time that I saw and heard the song "I'm glad you're dead, you Rascal You", this time on film, this time from Davis. Must have been a very popular song at this time.
