Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I am hungry for some good television and welcome TNT for providing these "opportunities". But unfortunately I'm in the minority when it comes to the movie Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing is, the irony is that it just does not translate well to the screen, big or small. With a few exceptions (very little), the King's experience can not be filmed with the same effect stories have when reading. Many people would not agree, but I'm sure they have to admit in their hearts that the best-filmed King story is just a faint memory of what they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the mental landscape of the characters in the story. It gives us insights into their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or unreal perspectives. In short, King takes the reader to places where you can not set up a Panavision camera. As viewers who see the filmed king, we have less than half of the information the reader has access to. It's not too far-to-say that you become a character in a King story you read, while you limit yourself to petty voyeurism of the same character while filming. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to record everything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of whether or not to do so. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes incredible talent and prudence to create the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is similar to the transformation of lead into gold or a mysterious Zen championship. Well, good luck next time.
