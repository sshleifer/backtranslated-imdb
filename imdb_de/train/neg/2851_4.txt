There are often poorly matched pairs (in the general sense of the word) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Mr. Allison" "Roots of Heaven" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (The title ) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese stuff was trendy at the time, with works such as "Sayonara", "The World of Suzie Wong" and "The Teahouse of the August Moon" testifying. Huston's trouble could be the worst of this rather bad amount (with the exception of "Susie"). John Wayne fits perfectly in Ford's world, in Hustons he's like a bull in a china shop. His Japanese partner is totally bored Dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are totally in love with Hustons every single piece have to choose between all his other great movies.
