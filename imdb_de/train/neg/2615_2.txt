I do not know why, but for some ill reason, I believe, I have decided to see 102 Dalmations. The first movie, which was a remake of the Disney classic with Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, seemed to be a sure hit, but it was just a bombshell. I think the reason why these movies do not work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to both children and adults. That was not really that funny, because it's adults walking around trying to behave like cartoons, rather than just human beings. I understand that they are trying to make sure they appeal to the kids, but it's ridiculous to see how these actors behave in the movie. And Dalmation's story is not really good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but things change when she has proven that she now loves animals and is a pleasant person. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy singer, but she buys a dog shed and is suddenly loved by all, and it looks like she has changed. However, when she sees the Dalmatians of her probation officer, she goes crazy and starts to see stains, and she loses them. She's back to avenge puppies and is still determined to get the coat of Dalmation she always wanted. Glenn Close is such an amazing actress who is undervalued, but she chose Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's be honest, this movie just made the funny villain a stupid nut case. As cute as the puppies were, they just work more for the animation, they sound silly, but they just are not that believable without the cartoon and its personalities being in the mix. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
