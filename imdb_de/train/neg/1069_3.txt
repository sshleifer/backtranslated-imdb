I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most viewers, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I did not. It features Lucas Haas (brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Confidential Art School). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a good job in this movie about three friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. All this takes place in a house on the lake and looks beautiful. The film wants to treat its theme first as a comedy and then as a drama, and I thought it had to be the other way round.
