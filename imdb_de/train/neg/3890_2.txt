A really unpleasant movie. Although the special effects of Rick Baker are impressive (when the stomach turns), they have no other redeeming features. As with many films from the 70s, one has the feeling that one has to take a long shower and cleanse the mucus of oneself. The characters are uniformly uncomfortable and the action makes no sense.
