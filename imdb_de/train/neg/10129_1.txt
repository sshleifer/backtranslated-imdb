I can barely find the words to express how completely horrible this movie is. I was sold for the action pledge, with Segal and stealth planes that usually provide an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say that I prefer to stick my eyes out with a cocktail stick than see this movie again. The spectacle was so horrible that it was almost funny. The story was incredibly weak, with the holes so far apart that you could fly a F117 through them. The script was so bad when I found out that a 10 year old wrote it, I should not be the least bit surprised. The direction and the production is so amateurish that I would not even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies for the wedding video. Exterior Exterior Drivel. Those responsible for this film have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed. Steven Segal should never show his face in public again, I can not imagine why he starred in this, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
