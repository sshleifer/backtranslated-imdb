This series is interesting to see as an MST3K feature, but for today's audience that's all. I was really surprised when I saw the year 1952. This alone makes this a solid (low) 2 in my book. The cars used do not even look contemporary, they look like 1930s. Basically, it's Cody (the salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh talks about insulting everyone else, like the military). Anyway, it's Cody in his nipple ring, who is wearing Graber and Daley, two stupid stooges, the handguns and occasionally a Ray Guns, flies pretty lame, enjoy it. If you want to see a really good show, you see Flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other, and a good evil nemesis and also good-looking women, that has NOTHING. And Flash was made about 15 years before this crap, so you can have some game. Something from 1952, so bad, deserves a 2nd Nuff. If you think of it as an MST3K episode, these guys have a lot of fun with it. a tweak of the nipples here, a tweak there and I fly! And as an added bonus, I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song, as originally sung by Joel, and its two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the love satellite for episode eight, The Enemy Planet: <br /> < br /> (singing at the beginning of the credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR OBSERVING CODY ...
