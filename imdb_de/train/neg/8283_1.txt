This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything needed for this joke. Personally, I do not care about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever so many people are fascinated by her in one way or another. Especially as a film, this is something that would not even exist in film school. The script is a mess, acting is cruel and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") did that makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did "Old School" because he screamed loud! This is not even in the same condition as my "Old School" DVD! Please DO NOT VIEW THIS FOR ANY REASON! I see there is a comment that this is so bad that it's good, but honestly that's too nice. When do we stop seeing singers who obviously can not continue acting? I hope it ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As for the plot, almost non-existent, and so badly written and written (yes, I know, it's another cleanup), I doubt anyone will remember anything about it. Whatever you do, do not waste time, but if you do, you regret the ACTUAL actors involved in wasting their time on this bomb. Jessica Simpson, you're pretty, but keep singing, even though I'm not a big fan of it. And whoever made this movie, I would not include that in your CV. 1/10, because you can not give zero.
