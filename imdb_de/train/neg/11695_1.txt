To label a movie like "Thinner" bad is to call the earth round or Pauly Shore not talented. No news, but how did they get that people want to know. <br /> <br /> So far this movie .... The book was good, even if it was a small derivative of other stories from the movie "Be careful what you wish for" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (Constantine from the room "Room 222") to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why is the gangster (Mantegna) involved? Why fire so many automatic weapons? Why should you make something so dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle effects of weight loss crazes, illnesses, death, gypsy knowledge and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, that should not be. Remember, this is Stephen King, of whom we speak. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a bit too talkative. In fact, the entire movie speaks too much, he must explain every attack. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thanks. <br /> <br /> A star who has at least tried to make a reasonably decent make-up. The rest of the movie is left ... say it with me ... "thinner".
