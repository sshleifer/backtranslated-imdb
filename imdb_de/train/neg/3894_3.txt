The Incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a bit lousy, but I found it impossible to somehow dislike it. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a while to actually melt, but if he does that, he's pretty impressive; We also have an imaginative death scene with electric shock. Also noteworthy is the music, which is insane - a cheese-elastic mess of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Remarkable highlights: <br /> <br /> * Admire the slow motion sister who jumps through a disc for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibalism that melts humanoids. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed when our hero takes a break from the hunt for the Melting Maniac to eat a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. It's just over 70 for me to hate it. It's cheesy and trashy, but I thought it was very funny. They could do a lot worse.
