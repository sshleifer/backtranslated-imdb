OK, I saw this movie a little over two years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to see it again, and I have to say, I actually think this movie is good. This movie was a blast when I know what you did last summer 3, similar to Final Stab for Scream 4, and this movie is not that bad. I mean, it had flaws and of course it would be ridiculous to release this in the cinemas, but still for a midnight popcorn movie, this movie is not half as bad. It has some fear and some really hot women that I could add. It also shows Joey Lawren's new, beefy look, though he obviously has not won any major Hollywood roles ... I feel bad for the man, he had such a flourishing career in the early and mid-90s, Some Disney Joey Lawrence was a bit of a player on the sitcom scene, but like in a 360-degree round, his career was all about low-budget movies like this one. > <br /> The movie also throws you in the towel, it makes you think between the crew, there's really a secret that someone knows, just to be disappointed, to find out the secret. It also throws you off who the killer is. I had an idea, but I would not believe the killer was who he was, but his motives in combination with the mystery were a huge failure. Was there a secret left out? This movie could have been one of the better rated movies. But I'm also a fan of college subjects, and I've been in college for spring break in a mansion-sized beach house that's similar to this one here, so I just felt like this movie felt so-so-slasher- Movie. Good for a midnight movie.
