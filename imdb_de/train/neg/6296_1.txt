This movie looked interesting; I had read the book a few years ago and was told that the feature came pretty close to the action sketch. I actually did not bother to see it all ... immensely annoying - bad performances, bad acting and immediately unpleasant characters left a bad taste in my mouth and put me into a downer for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this feature.
