This Italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R", but "X" was on the actual cassette inside. The latter makes a lot more sense, because in the end there is a short scene that was shocking. Even in the dark you could see the Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers, who made all this sex with this guy - and yes, you could see his penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time that a "lead actress" had done such a thing on the screen. Detmers parries naked in several scenes, but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly. A real waste of time and despite Detmers' looks certainly not recommended.
