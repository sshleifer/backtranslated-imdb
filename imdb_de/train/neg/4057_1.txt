This is an extremely boring movie. If you grew up during the Vietnam wax, as you did, you've seen and heard all the footage and arguments here a hundred times. But what makes this movie really boring is the story of director Carlton Sherwood. The bulk of the film is filmed as Sherwood speaks directly into the camera as he talks about this contradictory period in the history of our nation. If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then win Here I find nothing new. There is no new evidence condemning John Kerry, or new evidence worthy of any other documentation about Vietnam. Younger viewers interested in this topic should see George Butler's excellent movie Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly a job for John Kerry, but it fails miserably to achieve that goal.
