I can not even describe how bad this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much of a start. Let's face it, a PG-13 Slasher movie is intended to miss the ummm ... cut, so nobody should be surprised at the lack of Gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© that was shown in all other aspects of this film that really blew me away. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is just so useless that you are interested in evil. And here is an overview of the books ... IT DOES NOT CHANGE - and thus against the principle of basic screen writing - the character development. If you think that the poor little girl will turn around at the end of this movie and finally kick her ass, think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we may receive the least intriguing (and definitely the scariest) killer who ever made the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scary villains than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for tensions or tipping is removed from the incapable (and apparently thirteen years old) director, what else could be left to fill 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Cabinets, that's what. <br /> <br /> Many, many cabinets: large cabinets, small cupboards, mirror cabinets, cabinets for Narnia, so many damn closets that you do not want to dress for another year. In fact, this movie should have been called "CLOSET" and on the DVD case was a picture of an eerie wardrobe. On the back there could have been a photo of the falling asleep of the audience and a quote from Roger and Ebert - something to the extent, "What the hell, wasting our time just watching!"
