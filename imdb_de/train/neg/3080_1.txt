Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it costs a lot of time. I remember the day I saw this for the first time at MST. The sun was shining, it looked like a good day. then I saw this product by Rick Sloane, which was made up of awesome plush dolls that messed up in the crappy mainland of the 80s. Kevin is an insane guy trying to impress his girlfriend, running a watch, fighting rakes, and more in this very bad-looking series of pictures. No action or story is needed. Of course, no acting is necessary, as the film proves. An army guy and his crazy girl will make you jump off a cliff, and the awkward friend who gets his kick phone sex will let you say, "He has some nice red shorts." Besides, I really hated the old guard and wished he had an accident in his cart. If you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I recommend you, after watching this movie, a good month to regain the senses and the mind. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick in the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called hobgoblins.
