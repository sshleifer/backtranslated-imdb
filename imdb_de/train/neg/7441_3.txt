To quote the film, "It's better not to know it, better to forget, it's best to be given up." Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical sophistication of a Hollywood horror movie, but horribly bad dialogues after the first quarter of the movie The Beginning. <br /> <br /> It's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogues could be summarized by bad cop and a Jerry Springer show. Maybe for a movie like The Hitcher, not for a horror movie starring in Russia. The result is that a potentially great backdrop and some potentially great Gore scenes are wasted and just become silly, not scary or meaningful.
