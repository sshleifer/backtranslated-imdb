The real philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman to entertain troops coming from an air force base near San Francisco and entering the Korean War is Warner Bros.'s all-star greeting to patriotism and song. Many celebrities are guest appearances as a love-hate relationship develops between an aspiring star and a sorrowfully green and meager Air Force Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he's about to deliver newspapers from his bike). Apparently, the Corporal has made the actress believe he would go into battle, even though he is part of an aircraft carrier crew flying to and from Honolulu (they would think she was glad he was not in danger but instead it acts just like most childlike women in the movies of the fifties). Doris Day can be seen in the first thirty minutes, and her pronounced laughter and happy song numbers are very enjoyable. Roman is also here and looks glamorous, while James Cagney enjoys his movie personality, and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in a recapitulation of a hospital following Doris Day's lead, wondering, "Do not they have any more sets?" For undemanding spectators an interesting look back on another time and place. However, due to the low production costs and the appropriate technical aspects, "Starlift" is a strict successor. * 1/2 of ****
