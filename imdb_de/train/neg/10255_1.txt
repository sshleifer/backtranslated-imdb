There are Christopher Lee, there are huge banks of computers from the 70s that cause teletype noise when letters appear on the screen, there are radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark, but also emit pulsating drone noises, it has volcanoes ! evil aliens disguised as nuns! Tidal waves! Earthquake! Cars explode! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax, the entire planet blows up. How on earth did this movie manage to be so unbelievably stupid? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of the film consists of recordings that are mostly long tracks, pans or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three who do nothing but do something for the crew. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out, driving around, running around, looking at things, getting in cars and driving ... I just sat there staring at endless parades of nothingness in stupefactionem mumbling. "Please say something to somebody, just say something ... do something ... anything! ..." <br /> <br /> The dialogue, when it comes, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours." was a typically pointless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world through stock footage, grounded in Lee's speech as a head alien: <br /> <br /> "Planet Earth has triggered a plethora of diseases that contaminate the universe Light years away from here will suffer if they are not destroyed! "<br /> <br /> This is the writing of Neanderthal SF scripts. This is the kind of motivation found in Japanese fifties monster suit movies geared to 7-year-olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most terrible line from an English-language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. That this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters is unappealing. Lee, who has always thought of me as a smart, useful actor with a secure knowledge of his limitations, delivers his lines as if he were killing his agent for bringing him into this pile of dreks. I do not blame him.
