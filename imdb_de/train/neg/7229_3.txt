This film seems to begin in the middle, presents peripheral players as if they were significant, and presents main characters with no substance and paper-thin and / or impenetrable background stories. Almost no one has a credible or recognizable motivation for his actions in this film. The plot does not move and eventually goes nowhere, the dialogue is chunky and banal and the director has little idea how to get the most out of his actors. It almost feels like there is a first half of this movie, but it was never done. <br /> <br /> We've been told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York City and that, inexplicably, Central Park has become an arctic desert. None of this seems to have caused a sensation in the general population and is of minimal interest to the government. <br /> <br /> Eugenics introduces us to the "evil society," but that's just a convenient imagination to populate the universe with a few power triggers. The whole "Eugenics-is-bad" double-duckender is clumsy and never really swings here. We should take care of the central characters, but we never know enough about them to know why. So much of this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it appears as a one-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape. <br /> <br /> On the "groundbreaking" digitally animated world that was all created here I can say that at about the same time this movie was made, several other directors did the same with more seamless and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending the time to show this film the most burning question that still exists in my mind was "something like that?"
