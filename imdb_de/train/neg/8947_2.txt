The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film could not have adopted a futuristic technological vision of the book. Damn it, Total Recall was released a few years later and it worked well. Even a clockwork orange that appeared in the 1970s worked well for a futuristic world. The dark German Expressionist colors, the black-and-white shots of the screens, there is no reason for this approach when the film was shot in 1984. The main character is in an office worker, but he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. This film chooses a pseudo-communist approach to design, atmosphere, and theme, but the novel does not necessarily force a communist theme that practices the worship of the humble. This book must be seriously adapted in a modern context, as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not see more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, the film seems to deny a sense of realism or credibility, if this is exactly what is needed to hammer the messages of the novel to the audience.
