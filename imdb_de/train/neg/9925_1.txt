This was brilliant on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, but not so. Nowhere have I seen the name of Mel Brook and can imagine why he has so much more sense not to connect with this pilot. My rascal, who would find that funny. Sure, there may be a race problem, but for me it was just not funny because it just is not funny. It's as if the authors did not even try to be funny, just to make money when they're connected to Blazing Saddles. Did you expect that this show would take several seasons when they made this pilot? They did not care. It was a fast cash cow that thankfully did not pay. I think it's only useful for historical purposes or just to show how stupid and uninspired Hollywood writers can be.
