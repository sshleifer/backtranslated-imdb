You probably should have called this movie The Map, because most of the whole dumb movie revolves around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots the map has. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that build up on the forehead of our main character. This, of course, was the filmmakers' way of showing us how incredibly tense it is in the Immortal Hills cemetery. C'mon, could not you just have shown us one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about everyone on the map dropping off like flies but not seeing anything. Just as I meant Bury The Living to get my attention, I was quite generous with the rating I gave it, but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. If you do not have a deep fascination with cards or sweat, I recommend you hire a better I-movie, for example: B. I spit on your grave or I drink your blood.
