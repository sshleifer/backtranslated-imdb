From start to finish, this is the emotionally most reworked movie about NOTHING I've ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the title character and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The racetrack as a metaphor gimmick is so dubbed that it borders on clich√©s, but director Pollack treats every hairpin as if it were something very important. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is a value for some MSFT3000 replay from some of the scenes, as Pacino, who comes into contact with his inner wife, have an incredible value. But even such random humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
