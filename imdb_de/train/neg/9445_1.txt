Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was horrified. <br /> <br /> Do NOT bring any children to watch this movie. The humor is absolutely inappropriate for children - and they will be bored and disappointed. Sure, we've all read Theo's wonderful children's book and we certainly have expectations ... but that's pure garbage. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and would never have given a thumbs-up on such a devastating attempt to use a classic. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth a "free" ticket review. <br /> <br /> Stick to the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual representation - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on the cable by the day of Saint Patty.
