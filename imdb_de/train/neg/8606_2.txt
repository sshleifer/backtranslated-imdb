I love Killer Insects movies that are worth seeing. I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. I met him and wished I had listened to him as this movie was horrible as he said it was him after he said that I was still going to die to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: People die mysteriously and cruelly and nobody has any idea what the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only health expert Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer clubs is laughed at by the authorities. <br /> <br /> Only when the body count starts to get up and a slug expert from England starts snooping around does it look like Mike has the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most overreacted movie you have ever seen! Slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and it looks like they're fast-forwarding the scenes! <br /> <br /> This movie is not like the book at all, the book was ten times more scary, ten times more bloody and had much more history to offer! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! Since I'm a big fan of slugs, the book and the second book are called a hatchery! Both books are great. <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the movie. Maybe you want more than me. Give this 2 out of 10
