If you study Welles and see how far he has fallen to Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse to turn the protagonist into a self-proclaimed fool to explain how he might end up in such a half-baked scheme can not explain the absurd court theater and ridiculous conspiracies of the plot. Do not be as impressed by the high rating of this movie in the db as I am; I can only assume that there are a lot of hard, old Welles and Hayworth fans.
