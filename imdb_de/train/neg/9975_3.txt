I remember seeing this movie several times as a very young kid, and there were parts of it (many actually) that I did not understand. I think I once saw it as an adult and then understood those parts. The only problem with adult viewing was that it did not entertain me at all. What kind of film is this? Is it a "children's movie"? Not hard It contains language and topics that are not suitable for children. Is it an exaggeration of what each parent goes through with their own children? Maybe, but why not focus on John Ritter's character rather than Junior? If a movie has a 7-year-old lead character, it should be a movie for the seven-year-olds to be good with their audience, otherwise older people will have no opportunity to relate (even 8-year-olds do not want to film) I'm pretty sure this film did not go well at the box office, and the reason for that must be that he has not found a gap in the market.
