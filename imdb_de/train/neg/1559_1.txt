This could be the worst movie I'll see when I'm 100 years old. I think a group of first graders might have had better plans than a class project. I'm stupid to have seen him, and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film. <br /> <br /> And after I finally turned it off, I actually had the urge to vomit /> No one had any idea of ​​photography when he did this. Nobody had any idea about acting. Nobody had any idea about anything. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X occasionally shows this crap. The only time I saw it was on one of the Starz! Channels - not even the main channel. And it was about 3 o'clock in the morning.
