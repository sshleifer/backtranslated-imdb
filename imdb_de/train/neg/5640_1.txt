I'm a big Willem Dafoe fanatic and I really chose this movie (I had to get a Region 5 DVD from China!). But it's really one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting (except Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed this (though he is not a director) and they have NO recognizable talents for writing or governing. (Stay tuned to Willem, Giada leave the store, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. Apart from a series of completely unconvincing, completely without credible motivation, these two persons (who have just met) act in this house. Colagrande sleepy, I do not care that the expression NEVER changes. And the sex scenes are almost lame. I jumped twice with one of them. Yuck! They are definitely not a bit erotic and yet the movie is the only time you do not go to sleep. Then it's busy pushing you off. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
