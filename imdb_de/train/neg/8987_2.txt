The only redeeming quality of this movie is the real plot ... Otherwise this movie was awful. The drama was ridiculously bad and the set design was kitschy and very cheesy. The story was decent, but hard to see because of the terrible acting. I would not recommend watching this movie ... The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the actors were a bit attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the star of soap opera. Part of the editing was done well, but there are continuity mistakes everywhere ... I'm getting sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon?
