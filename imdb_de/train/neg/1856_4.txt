I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to the films produced and distributed by A-pix Entertainment. Without exception, everything this company is dealing with is pure crap! First, and that's very important, never look sober on this movie! Why would you? In contrast to many other offensive bad movies, this movie was purposely made bad in my opinion. I just can not get over how fake the snowman is, which is why he is always shown only briefly. The way he moves is the best! This movie is better than Waaaaaaaaaaaay Michael Keaton bitch, because the film is also a good movie, and this version is just as bad.
