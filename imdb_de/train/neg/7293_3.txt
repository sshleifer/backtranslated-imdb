Aaron Spelling produced this for the television Western, which becomes terribly plotting for a seventy-three minute film. It plays like a probably failed pilot. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is US Marshal Dave Harmon, who is going to Yuma, Arizona in time to kill one of the brothers of the local Bigwig Rancher on a trail trip. <br /> <br /> Walker brings the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican child sleeping in jail. One night, Andres slumbers as a villain and another man dressed in Army Blue brings the remaining brother on the street, kills him and pinned the murderer to Walker. Not good for the first 24 hours in the job. Walker visits the local army and equips the commander's chains. The Bigwig hears of the death of his brothers and rides back to the city in time to scratch his chains as well. The native population, which is converted by the army shortly to beef, is also avenged in the chain area. With all these chains, Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The murderous Army guy is dead, the local livestock buyer is involved, the Indians are talking hesitantly and the climax leads to an unlikely showdown as Walker has to prove to the town that the vicious cattle buyer had a boss. Someone we suspected that he was too helpful all the time. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-subplot that brings the death of Walker's family into the hands of Army Raiders, and I think that would be the power behind the series if it had been picked up. Instead, the movie ends abruptly and I've been waiting for scenes from the exciting episode of the next week. Due to the fade-outs for non-existent commercial breaks, the pace here is everything and the story jumps in attacks. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, tough and has a deeper voice than a fountain. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you've probably seen in other TV movies. Much of the action is quite lame and the violence is lukewarm. The first brother killed gets a gun and falls on him without scratching. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is the wrong movie to teach kids about the evil of guns! Speaking of children, the Mexican child goes very quickly from "sweet" to "aneurysm that causes trouble". <br /> <br /> If you do not like western, you will not like "Yuma". If you like western, you will still not like Yuma. I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not rated, but includes physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
