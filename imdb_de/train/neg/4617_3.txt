Eight Academy nominations? It is incredible. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even for Hollywood proportions. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leader, I would probably have swallowed the bait and looked at it anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I clearly feel betrayed by it. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy, right? Can someone tell me where the humor is in Prizzi's Honor? It's certainly tasteless (shooting in a policewoman's head is just a supposedly comic interlude in that intended farce about mafia life), but with the exception of a joke about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (for which I do see an old joke to Americans who were officially banned from buying Cuban products for 50 years.) I did not discover anything comic - and I tried. There's a lot of mafia cliché, but cliché is not a humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a kind of romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so unbelievable and flat that in Gigli they are equivalent to Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez. <br /> <br /> Is it a nifty parody about the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply pointless absurd and not comically absurd and it usually just feels like a really bad (and cheaper) mafia movie. It feels more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and little humor written for them, the actors remain dubious accents and make faces. Well, it's not enough; even if the face is pulled by that weird-witted master, Jack Nicholson (repeating with bloated upper lip ... now that's supposed to be a parody of Brando's padded cheeks in The Godfather? ... Oh, worry? ... all that I know is not funny. <br /> <br /> Throw in a slow, hard-working direction (this movie takes 2 hours), some hopelessly stupid and clichéd dialogues like; "Do you remember the Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll track you down wherever you are, "cliché manners, and you'll reach for the fast-forward button before you can say" capiche. "Prizzi's Honor is far removed from Huston's" masterpiece. " It's more of a work from the canon of the great director who was supposed to get a concrete coat and throw it into the Hudson River.
