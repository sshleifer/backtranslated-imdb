If you sit down to watch a comedy starring Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer, you have high expectations. These expectations are further strengthened when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic note was so obvious in DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE, among others. In the first five minutes or so it seems that these expectations could be met and then? Nothing. What should be a light comedy plunges into leaded, hard melodrama, and no giggle is to be expected. <br /> <br /> Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance or In this movie, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wooden, Parker seems unrestrainedly unfair. Not even as bright a light as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fate of this meandering, dreary and utterly meaningless script, which lazily draws and captures the viewer's interest and patience. </ Br> <br The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keeps trying to breathe life into the trials, but the terrible script goes beyond the revival. The desperate, insane attempt to elicit a half-hearted laugh from the stunned audience in the final moments of the movie serves only to offend the injury. This movie is a big disappointment at all levels.
