Like a hair shirt. Positive, absolute and without a doubt one of the worst films ever. Pure torture. Zero of ten stars. A long, boring, tedious, overbearing, self-confident, theatrical and artistic scene after another. Dreamlike and impressionistic thought, the soul bared, it is instead morose porridge. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son sound and whisper like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. Alright and now? <br /> <br /> More than once, the son repeats the line allegedly lifted by "Saints' lives". "The love of a father is crucified, and a loving son can be crucified." The parallel to God and his Son, Christ, is cumbersome, irrelevant and bombastic like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some references to the theme of Russian childishness: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Sons"; and of course Dostoyevsky: "The brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> Credits in English indicate the intended international distribution, which means that the excuse should not be used, that you have to be Russian in order to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is not nearly as accomplished or captivating as Sokurov's last "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son", an equally powerful lack of sleep, some scenes are shot from distorted mirrors, if not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic and is picked up from beginning to end by beige filters, stunning it both visually and dramatically. A soft-focus haze only contributes to the feeling of the drug. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack is blaring, never closing like a ribbon loop. An old radio is constantly playing in the background. Russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "Tchaikovsky themes". Of course, the presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means that all these irritating little sounds, radio statics, sounds, distortions and the like are "design". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as the traffic, as if it were improvised by bored actors and jumped out of nowhere into nothingness. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to label the thing without being the thing, so what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell , just the idea of ​​a shell. Could one demand a better definition of decadence?
