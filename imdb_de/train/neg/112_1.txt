This movie is just awful. John Ritter makes Pratt cases, 75% of the actors deliver their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, bad editing, awful soundmixing (dialogues are hard to find in places because of background noise), and an action that's really true nowhere goes I did not think I'd ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she was not dead. Even Bogdanovich's children are terrible (the oldest definitely reads their lines from a cue card). This movie is really terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until four years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV programs, cancel the cable. If a friend suggests it, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to see it, it's better to find another soulmate. I would rather prick my eyes out with grass arrows than sit back through this piece of rubbish. If I could sum up this movie in one word, the word would be Suckotrocity
