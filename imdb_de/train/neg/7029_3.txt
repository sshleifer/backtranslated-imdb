Phantom of the Mall is a movie that fits best in the easy-to-forget category. It's a lousy version of the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea in itself, but the plot and production of this film are far too weak to give this story a decent homage. On the good side, Gaston Leroux does not have to lie in his grave. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many unnecessary flashbacks and far too many boring sequences to make it memorable. In addition, the script writers wanted to give the story too much draft, as necessary. And though there are many secrets about the character of Eric, the basic action is ordinary and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** It's about a young couple brutally torn apart because the boy is killed in a fire. This fire was triggered in his home because he and his parents had refused to sell their house to make room for a huge mall. The boy survived the fire and he hid in the mall to seek revenge. Meanwhile, he guards his girl, who now works in the mall, and tries to forget her loss. **** END SPOILERS *** This fairly simple - but pretty effective - conspiracy is thickened by many pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. It was supposed to be just an entertaining horror movie, but desperately trying to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what the fans are looking for. There are a few innovative murders, but they are not satisfying enough for people who want to watch a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used a bit of humor !! This entire production - including the cast - takes far too seriously. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to cope with some positive aspects ... like Ken Foree !! Hard horror fans will surely recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! This is like the horror milestone that still needs to find an equal. Although his role in this film is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was nice to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she is an outstanding actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is there too, but I do not like him ... so my opinion about him may be biased. Finally, a small praise for the lead actress named Kari Whitman. She's an extremely beautiful girl and has a bit of talent ... too bad she never made it to the top. Actually, this movie is their biggest achievement and that says enough about their career ...
