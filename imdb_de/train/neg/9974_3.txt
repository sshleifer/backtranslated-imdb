I have to admit, I caught this a couple of times on the USA Network. The sheer stupidity of this strip simply has something to offer that makes me want to look at it whenever it runs. Yes, you're right about subordinate acting, the act that only a seven-year-old could enjoy, etc. But I can not help being sympathetic to some fellow actors. On the other hand, some of these actors volunteered for the even crueler sequel.
