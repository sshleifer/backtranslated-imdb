I have watched horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then I've seen good horror movies and bad. The actors did everything they could. The plot was just idiotic. Plus, it was just bloody. I can stand a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes a figure is stabbed on the back of the head and swallowed with his gut! Just stupid! Another problem with this movie is that it is boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end is just stupid. But then it goes with the rest of it! In the end, when the girl frees herself from the cannibal / ancestor, she receives help from an old lady. The old lady makes tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She became a cannibal! Retarded film
