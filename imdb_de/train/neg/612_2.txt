As far as B-movies are concerned, SCARECROW is one of those who are so bad that it gets incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser student, who is constantly being sought by classmates and rejected by girls, runs to his trailer garbage mother, who has sex with a drunken redneck. Then he chases the boy to a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the child's soul was put into a scarecrow who then walks around and kills the thugs that torture him as well as the teachers. In addition to being a brisk one-liner for each of its victims, this scarecrow can also make matrix-like flops through the air and kill people on sidewalks in daylight. Why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Just like the two unnecessary sequels that followed, this is not even worth laughing.
