After seeing the poster from the movie Smother, I knew that I wanted to experience one of those unbearable movie experiences that made me want to let my eyes out. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought wanted to save the movie. Unfortunately that did not happen. Mother is a terrible movie, but not executable. That's the best thing I can say. <br /> <br /> The script by Smother (written by The Same Types of License to Wed, which declare that they have anything but talent for writing films), are full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I did not even laugh when I saw this movie After the large amount of garbage she was involved in (such as the monumentally cruel and vile Because I said), some people believe that Diane Keaton's career goes down. However, I can not forget the excellence she has brought in previo for decades, in films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom. With Smother, she struggles a lot with her performance, but her character is so terribly written that she can not do anything with it. Max Shepard made a good impression with his solid impression in the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy. He does what he can with his figure. Mike White is also making a good effort, but he is not getting too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown in movies) like The Good Girl and School of Rock, so I would have liked to see him as one of the screenwriters of the film, rather than just acting on it. Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the aforementioned actors: waste. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Smother is to be absolutely boring and listless. His script is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we've seen on sit-coms. Stay away from this crappy comedy.
