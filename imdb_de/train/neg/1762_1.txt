This movie seems to be a rip off of many films that have dealt with the same topic in the past. Let the future viewer be aware that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the movie. William Baldwin keeps appearing in movies, and one wonders if he has a great agent or if directors and producers love his unusual stupid looks, complemented by the strange hairstyle he wears in most of his films. The only good movie in which he appeared is "The Squid and the Whale," in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading actress, is not feeling much better. There is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A film that can be seen at the viewer's own risk.
