I was really horrified by this scary movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a scary music. Really promising! After ten minutes you really start to sweat and feel uncomfortable, because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare, and what's worse, it all comes out. I spent an hour and a half trying to fight with total boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a really frightening picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and especially for your wallet, because the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for a cheap amateur home video is the biggest horror.
