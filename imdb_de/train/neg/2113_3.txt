Brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. No one knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that every bride wore a weird orchid and goes to her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) to conduct an interview. Now Dr. Lorenz a mad scientist with some weird habits, including sleeping in coffins and the syringe of his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the liquid of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short term that should not be boring. Although it starts out pretty well, it unfortunately gets stretched halfway through and gets boring due to clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and excellently brilliant; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, polite, reserved and very spooky countess. and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters also convinces as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It has a bit gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But on the whole it just did not keep my interest in the whole picture, and for that I have to rate it badly.
