I really do not know what this movie is about. It's like a college student art project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. The little dialogue in the film is as indecent and nonsensical as the pictures. A black woman enters the apartment of the main character. Somehow she gets pregnant overnight, then she is shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon, whereupon a white naked woman appears. I've never been so excited about how bad and meaningless a movie can be. To be honest, I want someone to see it so they can tell me what they think about. But I would not want anyone this level of hell.
