The first point that draws attention in "Forever Mozart" is the lack of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple, since there is no story, no script, no plot, or whatever reminds of the minimal structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated directors in the cinema industry and this pointless crap is one of his most hermetic films. I think nobody understood what this story is about. But there are intellectuals who justify and explain this messy movie, and it's fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
