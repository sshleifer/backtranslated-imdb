Recovery from Soho (1950) (London) and the up-and-coming people. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more and no less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can not really act is one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking about? Besides who are the spectators? Who cares about a book that has been well remembered? The usual London story of how the chancer takes his chance. <br /> <br /> What could really take this movie further down? Oh, I know, third-rate songs that sound as if they were made locally. David Bowie repeats the movie title again and again and that's the highlight. The soundtrack album is made of clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> But there is a good thing. Good rest of the period Soho. Too bad they could not think of anything to put before them.
