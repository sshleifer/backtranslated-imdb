The landscape is pretty and the dog is cute. Apart from that, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is pleasantly awesome as always, but the script is so horrible that he himself comes across poorly. The plot makes no sense, the dialogue is mute and there are many minor mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
