I really enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride', and I was thrilled that there was a movie version. A woman appoints a policeman friend for her own murder, and his buddy, a former cop and journalist, tries to clear his name by examining the dead woman's crazy girlfriends. It is fortunate that the film script corrects Mrs Atwood's awkward plot by focusing on the story of these two men who are the victims of women who have committed themselves to planning. Heh. Okay, you got me. When these people are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're made perfect for the movie, I'm eating the protective cover of my hardcover copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the film. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting if we do not see how they happen to a man, and a man's life is messed up. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - a man. Because it does not matter if a man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them being pushed aside for a man's story. Usually, I do not look for feminist views in the media and have tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I had not read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie more. So if you like the police and the ex-cop and want to know more about it, you're out of luck. Read the novel if you want to enjoy a magnificent prose and characterization subtly arranged in an action. It's the same story: the film dug it, ironed it and sprayed it with male fears. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
