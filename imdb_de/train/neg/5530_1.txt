Of the many problems of this film, continuity is the worst; and edited many years ago on VHS for a college cable channel, I tried to figure out exactly what went wrong. It seems like they actually made a much longer movie and then sawed it for ordinary cinema. For how much longer? Filling all the gaps in the storyline that we have would require about three more hours of narration and character development - especially given the fact that the movie we have is just so slow and takes itself so seriously <br / > That's breathtaking; What could the Halperins have possibly achieved here? Her earlier film "White Zombie" was a successful attempt to duplicate the early Monster studios of Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and was therefore quite close to popular zombie mythology that the Americans would know. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the uprising of the zombies seems to be an allegory for the politics of modern warfare. This would not only explain the opening and transformation of Dean Jagger's character into a megalomaniac, but also why the zombies in the movie actually do not do much, stand apart, look scary and wait for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we all love and loathe in zombie movies The movie should be entertaining at first and later perhaps also educational. And definitely - a movie about zombies should be zombies. <br /> <br /> Really one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood's history, but I can not recommend it, even for historical value.
