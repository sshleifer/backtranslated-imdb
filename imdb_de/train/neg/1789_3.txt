Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film particularly scratchy. Maybe because I came from a different time and country, but I found Crosby's constant references to the good old US pleasant at first, after a while banal and finally annoying. Do not get me wrong - I'm not an anti-American at all - but it did not seem like the English could do any justice and / or need that brave, oh-so-smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a "fish from the water" story, but unlike most movies of its kind, this time the "fish" is the upper hand. To be fair to both me and the film, I have seen it a few times every few years and always get the same impression. <br /> <br /> (I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, gave me the same reaction, and to my surprise, even my wife, who is American, felt that Too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) <br /> <br /> As for the film's premise, it is unique enough for its day and the minor cast Of course it is very good. The scenery and the music are also good, as well as the great costumes - though I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig of William Bendix looks awful (picture Moe of the three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All in all For me this would be a much more pleasant picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby, but since he is in virtually every setting, it is quite difficult to get through this movie.
