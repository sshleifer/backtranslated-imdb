From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this kinky story of political intrigue and murder. The story, almost like a comic tells, is hard to swallow. All-star cast, this bad effort is not only the fault of cast and crew: The novel was afflicted with the same flaws. It seems as if the story sometimes mocks the earnest effort being made in "Manchurian Candidate". A disappointment in all respects.
