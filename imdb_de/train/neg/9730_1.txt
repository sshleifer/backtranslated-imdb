I stopped this movie because Brad Dourif was there. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except for this movie. And I think that was just because he understood how stupid the movie was and did not struggle with a good performance. This movie is an unwanted comedy. Some of the lines just rip me off. And there are some lines that do not make sense, and it seems Tobe Hooper is throwing in rows without thinking about the plot. Oh! By the way, the action is bad! But it's one of those movies that is TAHT BAD, which is actually PAINFUL. I recommend this only to BIG Brad Dourif fans or fans of the other actors because the plot is pathetic.
