This movie is awful. The story is about a woman trying to figure out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, from noir / thriller to eroticism, with horror elements thrown in for good reason. The film has a very confusing structure, for example, with frequent use of flashbacks, without involving them in the story. The plot is poorly developed and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish who was who and what role they played. In many films, there are some implausibilities, but the scene in which the lead actor escorts a virtual stranger to his home agrees to go upstairs alone (where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun that she had brought. Calling the police was too hard to believe. Some of the cinematographs are very bad: we saw on a 42-inch television. So how anyone who has a smaller set can figure out what's going on in the scenes that were taken in almost total darkness is completely inexplicable to me. All in all, a messy mess.
