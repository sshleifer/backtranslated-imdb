A warning to you not to be misled by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is useless and incoherent, and often made me think of a sentence by Twain, wishing all the characters drowned together. When someone talks about the "Worst Films Ever Made" category, I'm not thinking _Plan 9_ or _Attack of the Killer Shrews_. it is as it is. What a complete waste of time - my own and everyone involved in the film.
