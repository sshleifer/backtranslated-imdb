When I first heard about Down To Earth, I was pretty excited. I'm a pretty big fan and Chris Rock, he was especially funny in Dogma. This movie, however, proved to be a disappointment. The performance of Chris Rock was nowhere near as good as it was in the past, and the film was very poor overall. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a stand-up comedy routine. Of course, that works well in the scenes where he's supposed to do stand-up, but in the rest of the movie that's not the case. Even when talking to another character, he seems to think he is trying to make a room full of people laugh. He has some fun moments, but they usually come during the stand-up scenes (no wonder they've decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much just there to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them are outstanding. <br /> <br /> Also the movie was badly directed. The film basically has a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. I prefer movies with more than a joke, but that could have worked and was pretty funny. The problem was, we've seen too much of Rock and not enough of the old White. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy who tells Chris Rock's jokes, but most of the time we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly so funny. The few scenes in which they show that the white man speaks like rock are indeed funny. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier. <br /> <br /> Overall, a few moments of laughter can not make up for the fact that "Down To Earth" is played poorly and badly directed. This was a pretty big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
