****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> Unwitting radio quiz show presenter Kyser and his mediocre band apologize to Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre for picking up a paycheck in this sober room , sporatically observable haunted house parody. Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to drive out the property of an heir; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes counterfeit media, but it turns out they're both conspiring with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his 30-year-old band "Kids" reveal the truth with as little humor as possible. None recommended, but the absolute horror fullness.
