One of my sister friends lent me this game and it's too damn hard! It seems like a breeze, but you have to learn how to make tons of complicated moves that force you to turn your hands into all sorts of uncomfortable positions, and you need to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your "score"! You also need to find those incredibly hidden pieces of the puzzle for which you have to perform almost impossible tasks to get them! And I'm only up to the third level !!!!! If you have no life, you may be able to stay home all the time, you may enjoy some of it, but otherwise you stay away! And it is definitely not recommended for children - they will pull their hair out within the hour!
