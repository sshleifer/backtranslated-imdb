Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once made the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976) and now only seems to make Hollywood thriller "by numbers". <br /> <br /> This is very light John Grisham material, crossed with the action of a television movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a stubborn and independent investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo. Not good if two unbalanced college evildoers (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild geese hunt - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene and Chaplin can not make sparks, we also have some go through boring, overly melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Cass's story. Then of course there are the frequent shots of a log cabin where undoubtedly the end of the OTT is set. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See every episode of CSI instead. It is to the point and much more exciting.
