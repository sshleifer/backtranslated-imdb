Anyone who has studied physics or cognitive sciences will leave after 40 minutes, as my wife and I go out in disgust. The ignorant masses could be drawn from the real science by the hand-renouncing arguments and the absurd "conclusions" (without even attempting a logical reason). I am offended by this nonsense presented under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the authors found a quantum physics book, did not understand a word of it, then looked at The Matrix about a thousand times and then wrote that movie. <br /> <br /> For example, the crime experiment in Washington DC was conducted by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A quick search reveals the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
