This is a cheap Roger Corman horror / creature strip. A DinoCroc is created when the manipulation of prehistoric genes is amok. A technically manufactured crocodile kills one's own first, then it gets the taste of a man and becomes after the escape to a fast growing terror. None of the characters have a depth, but they are not the focus. We only get some insights into the huge two-legged dinosaur offspring and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a moronic figure trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becoming self croc food. Nothing on the pier, except ankle. Without really outstanding roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most miserable is Matt Borlenghi and a disgusting professional crocodile hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed by the seductive Joanna Pacula, as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeemed as a lot of cucumbers.
