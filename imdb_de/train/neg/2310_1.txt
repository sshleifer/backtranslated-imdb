This was a really bland movie. The performances are third-rate, and the dialogue is so stilted that sometimes it was just turned around and died. My reason for renting was simple: find a movie with screenwriting. I needed some visual help for my presentation, so I figured why not use a clip? Boy, I was wrong. After searching my local video store, I found out where the name "Starstruck" was suspicious. I thought, "What the hell", and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very dissatisfied with my results. There may have been a scene that I could use, and by now I've fallen asleep for the banality of the movie. So ... I took that back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie that I can use as an example. On the other hand, everything would be presentable compared to the "Starfucker".
