Boy, this movie has deceived me. I honestly thought it would be a camping horror movie with no humor whatsoever, boy, I got a cold shoulder then. This movie was, and I'm honest, damn good. It was not scary at all, but the hassle and smart humor made this movie really interesting. Some of the terrible drama and clich√© murders were so painful to see that I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The murders are all vague about snow sports and Christmas, which made things more fascinating. The POV camera angles were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The film is about a viscous killer who was killed in a car accident with a chemical truck while being transported to jail. It is later revived in the same chemical, with snow spun into the mix. These ingredients have been selected to make the perfect killer snowman. He takes revenge as a snowman against the police officer who has sentenced him. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that was funny. I'll say that I'm also rather disappointed that this movie was not horror, but a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good story, but it was not done right. All in all, I like the movie first, but now it's really annoying. But this movie is much better and darker than the sequel.
