I can not believe how horrible this movie became. I feel magnanimous, even if I call it a "movie". Acting was flat, the cut was awful and the plot leaves many important questions unanswered. The premise was fine if it is not original: A small group of aliens lives in the US and is trying to take humanity slowly. From there, it goes quickly downhill. How could you convince a "human being" to accept an alien as his wife to make them an alien-human hybrid they need? They show a larval alien, but never show what it does. You have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect-looking skin on an industrial scale. They are throwing in the obligatory giant alien monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to see. I suppose I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has anything to do with it. How could he say to the huge alien monster with his teeth, "Get away from him, son of a girl" with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
