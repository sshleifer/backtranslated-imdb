Holy God, that was terrible God. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought I was going to undermine my eyes at Oedipus Rex mansion a lot. Dear God. This film does not deserve more recognition than anything a film fan of middle school did. Please save money, this movie can not offer you anything. Unless you enjoy side shows and sleep in cinemas. You know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. You'll be the only ones anyway. F @ ck this slideshow. <br /> <br /> You are warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend not to look at this. <br /> <br /> Hello. <br /> <br /> how are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> this comment was a hundred times It's more fun to do than to watch this Daym movie. that's sad.
