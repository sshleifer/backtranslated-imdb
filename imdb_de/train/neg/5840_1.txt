Well then. I have just watched a lot of films - all with different quality. I was not sure which one I wanted to check first. Then it hit me like a sack-a-rat: Rodentz. Warn the people of Rodentz. This monstrosity shows no one and is painfully boring. And it's about mutant rats killing people. Yes ... real crazy original. "Eating the gods" or "Willard"? That was better than that, and that does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Okay, here's the story: Inna Lab, the scientist and his brave assistant experiments on rats and theirs Labor's in a shitty neighborhood and a crappy building, and the brave assistant's feeble-minded friends are drunk and all become food for the crazy rats and almost everyone dies, and there's a huge rat that looks crappy, but it's killed , the end . Everything in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! The second we all realize that there is a huge rat, we all know that it will eventually die. ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> - Well, I've looked at it for free, but for everyone else ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Did not hurt, did not help: <br /> <br /> - Um ... well. the blood was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> --CG rats are not as bad as they might have been in some settings ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - .. In other settings, the CG rats looked pathetically cheap. If your movie has a small budget, you may not want to rely on CG. Take lesson to heart. <br /> <br /> - Acting is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> - The characters are uninteresting - we have a mixture of clich√©s and none of them are done so well. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Better - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - Giant Rat looks like a fat man in a poorly designed bear costume - that was sort of funny - but not funny enough to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> --Retarded, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All college student rat chow people drink tequila from huge plastic milk jugs - and yet they do not seem to be drunk for more than a few seconds. So you stay with continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Just terribly worse than you can imagine. It's not even ridiculously bad, like "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these movies are crap that you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The end of the lame action movie, complete with uninjured heroes and explosion. Because it did not feel like the rest of this monstrosity at all - but still crappy. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Make-Up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I occasionally took care of my son during the movie, so maybe I missed him, but was supposed to be there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (time average) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Just look at it when You love rat and bugs-based horror movies. Wait ... Check that. Do not look at it. It is crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
