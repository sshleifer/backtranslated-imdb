This film suddenly tried to do too many things: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbusters, juicy romantic comedy, promo for family values ​​... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably for everyone, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the very end. <br /> <br /> Although I have the spirit of WAR, INC. Guess, it pushes me to see something like awkward effort, especially when it's taken off its targets to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than just the bad spelling, direction and production of that particular movie. <br /> <br /> There is a critique of the corporatization of the war. But making fun of oneself diminishes the true cruelty of the action. Reminds me a little THREE KINGS that trivialize a real cause for concern.
