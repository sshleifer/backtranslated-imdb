Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headaches causing jerky zooms, maximum characters running around in the woods doing nothing. Until the time of 12:01 clock flashes on the screen, you can quickly see-and overlook nothing, because there are three hunters, of which we know nothing, if you do nothing. To be honest, the movie has some interesting string music, so maybe a music video would have been the right way to do it. Unfortunately, that should not be, and what should have been twenty minutes is unbelievable. Forget "Trigger Man," I know I'm trying. - MERK
