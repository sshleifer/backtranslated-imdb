What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions will be made to "Hollywood Special Effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or an improved sound. Facial expressions are usually covered in thick beards, and the Spanish language is a strange monotone sound that sounds the same in battle as well as in battle. I talk by the campfire. <br /> <br /> I saw these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to talk about. It is quite long and boring in some places. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that, given the lack of any land development, it is not very instructive either. <br /> <br /> It's also difficult to pick up any story from the film dialogue - it's a good idea to learn a bit about the story so that you can understand the context of what's going on, as the director does for some reason Reason did not think it appropriate to inform the audience Ches Band moved as they did. As a result, groups did not seem to be walking around in the woods and being shot for any reason. <br /> <br /> I would have loved to give this movie more stars. Somehow I generated more empathy and developed character depth, but somehow all the characters were still foreign to me at the end. The stars that get it are for realism and show the rigors of guerrilla warfare.
