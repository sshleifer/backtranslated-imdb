The command has a deadly mistake - except for some insane action - that the character simply does not resonate or even react. Two examples: A priest who goes through a graveyard late at night is suddenly attacked by spirits spirits. After fighting her, he goes on quietly as his buddy shows up. "Something is not right?" Ask his buddy to have seen the attack. "Just a few demon spirits - nothing I could not handle." No reaction, no surprise, as if he had changed a tire. His buddy is equally carefree ... must be a standard priestly training ... ["And then you put the wafer in your mouth, do you have any questions? Ok, keep going, Demon Spirit attacks ..."] <br /> <br /> Example two: In one place, the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something that has already taken care of it) could deliver it. As? Why do you have to ask a dying man! So the demon has hung an arbitrary person in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the stunning, panting man. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "That's not nice!" would have been more realistic than her answer. They never ask that they let the man go or in fact stop. The reaction closest to them is the least. They ask their question and leave. <br /> <br /> I had to turn it off at this point. My brain began to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (a star of four) <br /> <br />
