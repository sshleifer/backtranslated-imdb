If you read my review of SyFys "Dino Shark", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget blow that can offer these TV movies. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they somehow make fun of being "so bad, it's good". So I still cursed with guilt because he liked the "Dino Shark" undeniably hot (and recommended), and sat down to "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", a SyFy original film about a half-human, half-hammer exemplary monster that people terrorized on an island. With the safe prescription of the SyFy channel for the creation of B-movie creatures and a cast that William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo belong then how could go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the target ... not much, but enough not to recommend me. Why? Now, first of all, be Titularmonster, the dreaded Hammerhead-human hybrid, leaving a pile of Faux Military bats that actually become the primary villain of the film. Although the hammer head shrinks the body count, he comes (or or whatever you call that thing) only briefly before someone gets nibbled and goes directly afterwards. The rest of the film is a filler that puts our heroes against the above soldiers. That's just not as convincing to me as watching a walking hammerhead eat people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full report in my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
