I saw this movie in the movie theaters and was shocked when I came into the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! That told me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was awful. Ben Affleck plays a man who buys a family for Christmas. It's a very predictable story in which he falls in love with the girl who hates him. His acting is OK, but he is not very good at the comedic aspect of the film. The plot is bad and the comedy almost does not exist. <br /> <br /> But there are some good points. For example, the family falls apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review prevents other people from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room !!!
