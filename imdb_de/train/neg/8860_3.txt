OK, as everyone said, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a bloody sexploitation movie where a lot of material was cut out (or darkened almost to the point of invisibility) to avoid the X rating of censorship; But the movie also has many other mistakes. <br /> <br /> At first, the scriptwriter seems to have mixed his werewolves and vampires. The bad guys in this movie are furry and do not like silver, but in every other way they behave like vampires. Now you just can not do that with a crappy genre movie, you have to stick to the rules of the genre, or the fans will get confused and annoyed by suspending the unbelief on the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but makes no sense in a werewolf movie. Second: The werewolf costumes are the poorest I've ever seen Everyone in the werewolf movie business should know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are critically judged by the fans, but some of those werewolves are just stupid. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things. I really liked the score. Others have mentioned the tits of Sybil Danning. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if there is such a thing) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan to attack the fortress of the werewolves. There are so many horror movies that rely on stupidly restrained characters, but in this case, they first acquire a very reasonable and effective arsenal against werewolf and slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have pretty powerful firearms these days. Should not it be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in a typical style, this movie goes far beyond the borders and adds a few other very crazy and amusing anti-lycanthropic weapons.
