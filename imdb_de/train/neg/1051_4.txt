Although the songs of Frank Loesser are among the finest that Broadway has to offer, they are influenced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's lethargic staging and uninspired presentation - when it's over, it hardly feels like you've seen a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's sophisticated yet moody tunes for maximum impact: For example, one of the best numbers, the show-stop Adelaide's Lament, ends in a chaise longue when Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) finishes sitting; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual 'Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat 'sits on deck chairs just sitting there. Mankiewicz taps all the fun by letting static scenes through for too long, and his dialogue (adapted to Abe Burrows's playbook) has none of the joke his films have like "All About Eve." Part of the blame must be on the leads, almost all of which are misunderstood: Marlon Brando looks confused as to why he's in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a much too nice guy and has no advantage that makes him so essential (Die Songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way Shirley Jones could. Only Blaine, like the lovely showgirl Adelaide, directs our attention like a Broadway pro. The colorful Art Direction was created by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol designed the eye-catching sets.
