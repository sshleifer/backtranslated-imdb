Breeding Victor Vargas fails terribly because of what he tries to be the most: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and unreal. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad Director Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems as if Mr. Sollett has read somewhere that it would not leave an authentic impression if you do not light his film. Not correct! There is only a bad feeling. Even shaking the camera does not give your film a documentary style, it just causes headaches and distracts from the screen's content rather than improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what appears on screen is so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the sole purpose of trying to show and show his Sundance buddies "hip." how "nervous" a filmmaker is who he is. <br /> <br /> All in all, the only lasting impression This film leaves you with a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about some writing and lessons?
