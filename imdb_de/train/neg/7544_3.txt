At first this movie was not so bad. It was entertaining ... at least for me probably for all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of this weird Christopher Reeve movie, Village of the Damned. The two films have different actions, but the eerie, disgusted feeling and the unwanted comedy exist in both. The Wicker Man is probably a mystery / thriller / men. Please do not upset the women's movie. I do not know that the whole pagan thing and the victim were aloof. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad-self, goes to a remote island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long, lost fiancée claiming that her daughter was taken away and hidden by other islanders , <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer. As a tired policeman he goes to the semi-unknown island and leaves nobody who is in the real world, his whereabouts. Stupid. <br /> <br /> It gets weirder when the big Amish women who populate the island growl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancé is no help, which seems to be clumsy and tired all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter, and he is the lucky man who came to this island as a victim during Thanksgiving Day. In this movie Men It's not so good. A sick, twisted representation of feminism? <br /> <br /> I sometimes found the film ridiculous, especially when Cage beats women and walks around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women locked up on an island without caring for men quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women were a bit hurt and angry, this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned off the film disgusted, if the roles were reversed. This movie may only be shown once or twice. It is NOT a thriller, it should only be classified as strange.
