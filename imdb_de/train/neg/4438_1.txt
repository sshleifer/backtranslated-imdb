I borrowed this movie from the library and I think it could be adorable. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to see the scene with her. She's a pretty girl, but in this movie she's not at all seductive, but I have to testify her clumsy attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It is so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so presumptuous and lacks the humorous fact that makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Total failure.
