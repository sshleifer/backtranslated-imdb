This movie is one of those that I regret to have invested 90 minutes of my life in which I will never return. The premise is really interesting - essentially it's a zombie movie from the perspective of the undead (let's not split our hair, if they are even split are actually dead or not) Unfortunately, they do not deliver a compelling story in this frame Although unbearable monotony of the life of the central characters may increase the realism of the film, but the entertainment value does it all harm If they had tried a little more to occupy the viewer, it would have been much more likely that they had driven the social commentary home.
