I had seen "The Eye" before I saw this. I really liked "The Eye", it was one of the best films of the latest Asian horror movie. So I chose this "Bangkok haunted" because it was the same director and it was kind of popular here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok haunts" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts etc. that are not scary at all, not even disturbing (like "The Eye" was) ... nothing. I can not even fill out the 10 lines required for the comment. <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 2/10
