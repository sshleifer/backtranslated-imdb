I like a movie that has at least a trace of history. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes without cohesion. <br /> <br /> There are scenes in which a person collects cane cans. A woman with a blond wig never takes off her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never know why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in a fast food scene where the "California Dreaming" is heavily overplayed by Mamas & Papas (I liked the song). The dialogue is mostly about food (pineapple, chef salad and drinks order). I assume that most of the actors gained weight during the film because a lot of fast food was consumed. This is supposedly a romance - it's nothing like that. I'm just wondering why I did not hit the fast-forward. I always waited for something important to happen? Maybe that's not the only consolation for this movie - the scenes changed so fast that they convinced you to assume there would be a revelation for all the nonsense.
