I got the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's over soon. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, what I expected from a movie with Shaq playing a magic, knocking ghost coming from an old ghetto blaster (that was there) probably a good reason in which he plays there was caught). The boy in the movie playing Max is weepy and a terrible actor. He is bullied by neighborhood children, which I do not blame because he is a small shower bag. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and extremely clich√©d. About a boy whose father always works and is never around, who finds a new friend who improves his life and finally helps him to reunite with his father. <br /> <br /> At the age of 8, I thought that was a stupid idea. It's a surprise that all the people who worked on this movie made career after stages because it's embarrassing and should never have been done. I could tell you more about how this movie crap, but you should know it by reading the story.
