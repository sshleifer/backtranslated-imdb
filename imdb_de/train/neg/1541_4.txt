I did not like this movie and did not like it that much during the scene where the loyal gang was shot by the British. The film effectively accuses the people of NI as the cause of their own problems. It suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and had nothing to do with the division of Britain and the rule of its history, that is, NI was founded by Britain in 1921, irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. </ Br> /> The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, though I despise loyalist paramilitaries who fought for one thing - to uphold their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a well-known fact that during the war, the British secret service collaborated with loyalists to undoubtedly keep Catholics at bay and to demoralize republicanism. The values ​​of the nineties about machismo, masculinity etc. are transferred to the 70s Belfast and are presented as part of the supposedly unique Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. The stupid song of the woman in the club - old Ireland from green fields ... bah ... blah ... - gets a symbolic stature, d. H. Poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Laborious, ahistorical, cheap and ugly garbage. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
