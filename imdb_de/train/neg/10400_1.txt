Enough is enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making films based on a concept that's long gone. The first Tremors movie was great. The second was ridiculous. The third was disgusting. The television series was depressingly terrible. And this movie only drives the stake deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry. Now we have set the series in the Wild West (1800) and are fighting with Graboids. Like a replenishment of the first, they must learn to beat them again. Easy entertaining, I suppose. Otherwise, this direct video release just as much as Tremors 2 and 3 goes too far. Oh, and I keep asking myself how there's never been a record of these events. Did you just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think such a thing would be rich in history, so that our buddies in the first movie would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Films like these that ruin the original just make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
