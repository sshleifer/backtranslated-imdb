Envy is bad for a variety of reasons. Yes, there are unlikely characters. That is not the problem. They are unlikely and we do not care about it at all. "The War of the Roses" had unlikely characters, but due to appropriate introductions, we found at least an interest in their fate, while in "Envy" the introduction is thin, the characters are never credible, and the plot just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply disgusting in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller sat down for the release of this video, and now I can see why. The movie suggests he's "best friends" with Jack Black, but for the first five minutes we get footage suggesting that Stiller hates black. I thought this would develop into a kind of one-sided relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but it never does, instead, Stiller insists that he is his "best friend" and I felt confused when he was black seemed to treat with black. "Poo." The plot of the film is ridiculous, but does not matter, because it is supposed to be an exaggerated moral history. Unfortunately, the message is confused. Walken performs well, but black is inappropriate and annoying (and I usually find him very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the worst movies ever, but it could be a lot better his . I wish there was Va-Poo-Rize - so we could make this movie disappear forever ...
