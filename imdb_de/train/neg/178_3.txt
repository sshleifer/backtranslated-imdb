This movie was made for television. When I think about that, I'm not going to go in as hard as a movie. The script is sub-par, but manages to be mildly humorous in places, whether it's supposed to be or not. Acting is usually over the top, but that's true for a lot of movies on a smaller budget. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie I really hated was that 90-95% of it is filmed on film, but in random places 5-10 seconds are shot where the footage is shot on video. You can tell it because the contrast is lower, the colors are less vibrant, and the footage is a whopping 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second of film. I'm not sure if these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they did not have the money to shoot in the movie (I suppose that's why), but it's disorienting and makes the movie real Shabbier than it looked. Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I would definitely not say I liked this movie and I can not recommend anyone to see it.
