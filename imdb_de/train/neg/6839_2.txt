Twin brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) twenty years later to avenge their parents and take back their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact lasts for two hours and basically adds no real attitude to the Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme's plan, while the evil twin brother is embarrassed as a good twin brother. Also, the action sequences are not so exciting this time and Jean-Claude relies more on shots than his martial arts. The minor cast is wasted and after two hours the film is just boring. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
