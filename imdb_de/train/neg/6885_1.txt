... in an otherwise terrible, misunderstood, supposed oedipal comedy. <br /> <br /> I was the only victim tonight at a screening of 7:20 am (3 days after the movie started), knowing that the moviegoers were paying attention to the warnings. <br /> <br /> The flower is in front of Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin is not his fault; but his geeky kid shouts warming up in another bad wig just does not work. It would be another crime if this would be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton is likely to survive after taking this paycheck - basically because so few have seen her in this worst vehicle she has voted on in the last few weeks (even laughed) Whenever Daniels was given the freedom to do the single three-dimensional character of the film. He really belongs to our best actors. <br /> <br /> In summary, even Jeff Daniels' work can not live up to this image.
