From the first time I saw the film's box and the extended photograph, I thought this guy, that friend of the 'black', must be 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches long. <br /> <br /> Not 5 meters high. That is not his fault. <br /> <br /> At each review, I shot the movie of a cool evening in Tucson, on the second story deck with a good cigar, and let it roll. At that time my wife had an affair and things were going downhill for me, so I needed a good distraction. But as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot too, I could admit. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie a lot. I always feel good about it !! It's not that trying to be cool is "too hard" or that "it's so close" to getting an action movie ... it's hectic. And then really unaware. Then hectic again. It's the best of the best when it comes to a slow chase scene. Impressive!! I never felt safer in my life. Warm and happy too I was grateful that they saved on gasoline during the hunt, because less was produced in the summer months ... no matter in which direction newly choreographed and tense, the sound was not affected by the delivery, it just kept going , the other way. The "locals" of the village they were in, more like the city, were "out of line", they also did not seem to follow what was happening, they would look into the camera and even "stare". Like a deer in the spotlight, only a few of them glow with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because 'Columbu', which I am just betting on, has a good heart and a caring spirit, both for the people of America and for its own countrymen. <br /> <br /> "Baretta's Island" is very lethargic and unbelievable. I still like it too. My now x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, I'm pretty discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even "love". All in all, I like Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> As a movie that adds an adjunct, if you'd like to kill a couple of hours of really fun watching, directly to Video B movies or "bad" movies for your small library collection, if you can find them look at 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar .. you know the big guy from' TANGO & CASH '. "The Big Sweat," a bomb of a police story with no real discovery and action that is so lame, it could just as well be "on crutches" and at the end of "The Big Sweat" I think they run out of money because they run out of money had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and burned it during the credits. -Have fun. <br /> <br /> But all in all, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave a '1' and an overall rating of 'terrible' for a terribly good B-movie. I'm waiting for the sequel, maybe like "Baretta's revenge on Montazuma" (Franco is on a Mexican holiday and then gets sick on the water, declaring war on the water.) Or "Barettas Powder War" as if he's getting off a big drug investigator in his Land and chemical gene splice and produce a hybrid superbug (insect) that is bred and dropped into the cocaine fields, the coke eats and forms a chemical reaction as it passes through the bow, which turns the coke into pure powdered sugar. Then he would have to have another sequel to save the adolescents from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a large toothpaste company to support the project and partly finance it with careful product placement in the feature. Law?(*)
