How this piece of garbage was filmed, I do not lie. The only actor I know of is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production. Rotting tomato price, this movie really makes B movies a cinematic pleasure. A car drives on the highway with the police in tow, and nobody knows how to stop the car, yes, right. <br /> <br /> The script must stand on the back of a cigarette box. Most TV movies are awful, but that defines the word new. Look at the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.
