Portly nice guy falls in love with a luscious blonde; She likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. The little noticed black comedy of the writer Pat Proft offers very good performances of Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but has no lasting effect. It's just a quick throw, led by Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins. Also on the level of B comedies, the somewhat similar "eating Raoul" is the better choice. It's definitely an amusing setup here; Unfortunately, the picture has no place in his second act. An interesting experiment, which fails, however. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
