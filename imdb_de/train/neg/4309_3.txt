A high school student (Keenan Wynn) with an inferior basketball team inadvertently hires a trainer who is not only a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby), but also a catalyst for her new successful ways. Are you really surprised? On the way, a romance between the coach and the star player Jack (Michael Biehn) expands. The police will never be notified. <br /> <br /> Together with other Crown International Pictures packaged as a Grindhouse movie, this movie really does not provide any service. This can easily be turned into a TV movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as a trainer for Randy Rawlings, especially in her tight outfits, but I was more than joking with a R-rated movie. A side plot hypnotizing a dorky center for his teammates to think he's former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's recent success, not Cathy Lee. Too much teasing and too little sour make this a big disappointment.
