This documentary is a reenactment of Betty Page's career (Paige Richards). The Tennessee Tease was the most famous pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work was created in the 1950s and consisted of fetish photos, bondage and cat-fight "Girly Flicks". Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in his Movie Star News told Betty what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or "deer films", but nevertheless, Klaw was accused of distributing obscene materials and ordering them to be destroyed to avoid persecution. It's no surprise that Betty had a cult at the peak of her career. The girl next door, with jet-black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figure wearing fetish clothing or not, would be fascinated for decades. After all, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and is second only to the world's most photographed image, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie could have been much better; but good enough to keep the interest. Miss Richards is amazing by itself. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not hurt their image in the least. With in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be warned that this movie can change your heart rate.
