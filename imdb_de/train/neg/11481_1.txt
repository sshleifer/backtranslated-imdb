If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they get other actors than people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw down the wise old wise man when he was never in danger? It forced the old man to mask the injury out of pride, and so the young man would feel guilty and leave him with a life-long disability. I think that's why the main character rejects the money and the old man treats him as a dog, even if he volunteers for extra work. If the D-Bag friend is a bad guy because he's a long-distance friend, why is a soldier better? He has a good reason to be jealous, a good reason to get her out of her hometown and go over the protective, controlling manipulative father. All the characters that should be sympathetic are not and everyone else is the "bad" friends. How did you even meet, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
