A low budget effort from Texas, which is at least well filmed, but that is no consolation. Bad drama or, if I should say, bad dubbing, a pretty slack plot that's nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It seems some young people are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year it looks different. Has a long, extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying, but definitely fills in the vacancies, of which there are many. Foul, puerile, definitely avoidable, at any cost.
