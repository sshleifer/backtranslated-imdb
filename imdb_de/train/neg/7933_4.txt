I'm a big Randolph Scott fan, but this movie is a doodle. The whole thing has a felt, fake soundstage feeling with a really awful rear projection. It has a good storyline idea that the scriptwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script, making it impossible for the audience to immerse themselves in the action and really take care of each of the characters. The direction is pedestrian and just emphasizes how bad the script is, rather than improving it. I have seen many thoroughly enjoyable "soundstage productions", but this is not one of them. All you do is appreciate all the hard-boiled Scott / Boetticher movies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, trimmed, and shines with that million-dollar smile. He is always a pleasure ... even in the worst movies. Apart from Scott, the main reason why I wanted to see this movie was the fact that I really enjoyed Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie "Rocky Mountian". She is just as beautiful in "Man Behind The Gun" and it can be said that she is a good actress, but she had to say some pretty fools and the blockage she was given by the director was really awful. I just saw Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific," and he plays exactly the same character here ... an arrogant ache in the butt you want to knock into unconsciousness. I think that shows that he is a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic relief that in my opinion only distract from the movie. Although there are many elements to knock, I have to say that I really enjoyed the two Spanish songs that were sung in the musical numbers. But that's not why we're going to Randolph Scott's movies, are we? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse Scott films, and this film is certainly not unbearable, but it can not be considered mediocre.
