No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing of the release was terrible. The gong show was "jumped the shark" at the time the movie came out. So who would pay, just to see a few of the censored clips from the original series? And the show clips are just a tiny piece of that pathetic, 90-minute whine of Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as a moderator of the show. Did he really expect us to regret him and his confused life as a millionaire? Did he really think we wanted to know anything about his life? (Of course, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA employee.) Did he have the gag to have everyone everywhere he would audition for him for 90 minutes? Or the network manager who persecutes him at every opportunity? This could have worked as a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the Unknown Comic again (although the film was "spicy", it contained only its worst routines). And as someone else has said, this is Phil Hartman's first major film part (though it only takes a minute). Note that his name is written in the credits as HARTMANN. This is the name he was born with. You can not miss his voice and his expression, even though he is much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny role; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
