This movie is like any other Dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies like Turkish Fruits and the little blonde Dood. Then you may agree with that (though these two have much better stories and actors). Zomerhitte starts hard enough, but even this good scene has nothing to do with the plot. There's a lot of nudity (but me and others just could not find this girl attractive), the dialogue is ridiculous (since we've done a lot to annoy other movie watchers), and some scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional case Comedy as Everything Else (like a random scene where an owl pulls out one's eye ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once in a sentence and says, "Did you hear what happened ... "I was there.") The only reason I've given him a 2 is because some of the places she's in look nice ... that's it, and the reason I've seen was that we looked at the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a weird sneak preview system, you pay less money than for a regular movie and you do not know which movie you are) all you know is that it's a new movie that's not in yet the cinemas is. My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie, temmink or zwartboek.
