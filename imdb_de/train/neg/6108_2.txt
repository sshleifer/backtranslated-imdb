Tarzan, the Monkey Man, is a 1932 remake of the film, and is unlike the earlier film with Burroughs' literary character. But while the Tarzan was reduced to "Tarzan - Jane" from 1932, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or growl. He does the Tarzan shout a few times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier movie. No, Tarzan plays Bo Derek a second banana than Jane. Or rather as a third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and right breast. This movie has no point in showing Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes of the movie are shown in slow motion and are really bad. Further evidence that nobody cared. <br /> <br /> Tarzan strangely has an orangutan kick in this movie. Maybe he has pooled a car from Sumatra with the Indian elephants, also exhibited.
