I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, acting is a mess, the special effects (if you could call them that) look like something that would not be out of place in a school game. Some of the characters in this movie are so stupid that they startle the moment they appear on the screen. Forget it for a story. This is a warning, do not waste money on this movie, it must be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If you like this movie for some reason, you probably also see Troll 2.
