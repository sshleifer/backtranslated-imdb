When exactly does a good movie go bad? When does a movie change from "watchable" to "where is this & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF switch"? Luckily for DVDs like these that can be borrowed for free from the library! Thanks also for the fast forward on the DVD player. I'm sorry for the people who were fooled at the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot exactly when it's all just a blur now), our "hero", Luke Wilson, starts through the traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. At this point, I gave up when I realized I did not care if he found his way or was run over by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last movie was interesting as Luke Wilson climbed out of the dumpster, foehn in hand, and first the "heroine" Uma Thurman. This scene ended with a helplessly dangling criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far above the leaking hatch and Uma. That was the last time that the movie was funny and when was this scene? Ten minutes after the movie? <br /> <br /> Every time the movie became "funny," he could not. Every time the movie approached "excitement," it came in the opposite direction. If a score might have helped to push life out of this fool, the soundtrack remained empty and mute. The sex scenes were not required and were incomprehensible; the damage to sets and props is unnecessary and childish. When Uma turned into a crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt like watching The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction. I realized there was no going back because I did not like "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction" at all. Luke Wilson's buddy Rainn Wilson (also starring in the dreary "The Last" Mimzy) adds only injury in this terrible movie, and Rainn Wilson, the king of television boredom, should stay with this equally awful medium, Hey, Rainn Wilson! Leave full-length movies alone! Each time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, appeared on the screen, I expected Jason or Freddy or a monster to jump out of the scene with horror as she watched Anna Faris in "Scary Movie "See, that's all you ever see, no matter what movie, no matter what medium, the character played by Wanda Sykes was just awful and so out of place in this movie.
