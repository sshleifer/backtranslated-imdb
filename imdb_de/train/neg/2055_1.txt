There is absolutely no reason to waste your time on this "movie". The original said everything and still holds. Either read the book or research the story, and you'll find this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! In Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where history is set, the sets and locations did NOT look like Kansas. The original is intriguing, from the filming to the filming locations to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and Cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is now available on DVD in widescreen format. Let this turkey die a quick death.
