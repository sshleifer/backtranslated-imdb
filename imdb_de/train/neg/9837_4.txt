This early John Wayne Lone Star Western has a little more to offer than the usual watersports Wayne had previously made for Lone Star. For one thing, it has its old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, a much better actor than the usual Lone Star villain, gives the environment the much needed professionalism instead of the usual hesitant line readings that are often made in these Oaters. The conspiracy of false identity, wage theft, and murder is as banal and superficial as one would expect in a 1930s low budget Western, but Wayne's tighter looks, carefree charm, and a slender path go far to make it more enjoyable. The chubby, bald-headed Eddy Chandler is not really credible as Wayne's female "partner," and there's a gag when something happens when Chandler and Wayne get into a fistfighting tiring. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest plays none other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the early "Little Rascals." She is now 20 years old, blond and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's leading ladies in this Lone Star / Monogram "B's" were pretty boring and colorless, but Mary is cheeky, cute and, yes, sexy. There's a scene in the shop where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic" that happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to take a ladder and climb up the shelf. Wayne caresses her little ass as she climbs the stairs, then, as she comes down, and a few minutes later, when he asks her to climb and get him another bottle, which is surprisingly racy for a 1935 film. Try to hide the fact that he is definitely checking her butt. Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The last shootout is not handled very well, and Chandler gets a bit irritating after a while, but all in all it's worth a look, if only to see the cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
