My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie fans. We've seen almost EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now we have seen many good zombie movies and many bad ones. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The drama was not only terrible, but the special effects, graphics and "zombie make-up" were the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eyeshadow around the eyes) This is the absolute proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Because the cover of the film is the only sweetie. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so stubborn about this movie that I went so far as to put a sticky note inside the film before I returned it to the movie and said, "This movie is shit, do not waste time, return NOW" hahahhaa, me Who wants to waste a good movie night with this POS movie! I do not even know how it got the ratings, it should be negative
