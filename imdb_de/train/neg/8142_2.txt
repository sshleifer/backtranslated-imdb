After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerated transformation into a man-bat creature. His wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him, it's all about rabies or anti-rabies drugs. The local police officer thinks John is responsible for several cruel murders. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a hell for a horrible movie. The script is deadly boring and there is no slip roll or nudity. This pointless piece of crap is so stupefyingly boring that you scratch your head in disbelief after you've endured it. Even the design of a man-bat creature by the young Stan Winston is utterly pathetic and imperceptible. Avoid this stinker like the plague of 10.
