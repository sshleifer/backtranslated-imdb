The main flaw of the film is the uninspired screenplay. It commutes between the vignettes of Bettie's story and the new creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw novelties have been done well, it is not necessary to recreate them in their almost complete entirety. While Richards is not an amazing actress, she does a decent job overall. And sometimes she has a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also noteworthy is the attention to detail. Costumes and clothes well done, as well as the given direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel like a step, but feel the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette has been well thought out to give the overall picture a vivid retro feel.
