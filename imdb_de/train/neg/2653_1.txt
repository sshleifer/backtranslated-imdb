I could not believe how horrible this movie was. I rarely watch commercial television, but thought "well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching". I am correct. Everyone involved should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I realize there are not big roles for women at a certain age, but the script was so incapable, clich√© and confusing, that I'm surprised it ever got underway or that Mrs. Keaton thought she could make a silk bag out of that sow's ear. None of the characters was incredibly believable and so incredibly unlikely. The acting looked like exercises in an INITIAL CLASS - I stared open-mouthed amazed by most of these questions and wondered, "What did you think?". Very, very sad that it came to that. Do not waste your time.
