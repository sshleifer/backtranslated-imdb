When you see this show, you are not sure if the story or the drama is more annoying. First, the plot of each episode is very predictable, the authors must have used every possible clich√©. Not only can you guess the general storyline, but also the arrangement of the scenes and the lines of each character, making the show appear in some form to a collage of every police line out there. At the top is the "message" of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good will have the upper hand and we shall all love each other, man and man better citizens, all in the most apparent way , The actors in charge of this message and nothing else will use a limited number of acting skills: the smile "I am a good person", the concerned look and the "posture of victory is our" baddies have the "I am a Bad" frown and the "You Got Me" look, followed by the "I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society" general evolution of each show). True story or not, the show is garbage, further proof that the producers are not worried about the audience, that we are all considered idiots. Well, this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brain out of you.
