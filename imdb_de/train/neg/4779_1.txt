I liked it in 2004. Then it became very stupid. It implies that children are brainless. It offends children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He succeeded in being interesting and imaginative in children's programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like adding 20 spoonfuls of sugar to your sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in making money instead of taking children's ideas and making money! Lately, my kids are voting the old shows (sixties) to find something interesting. In the absence of originality, television may look back on its past and reuse children's programs from earlier times.
