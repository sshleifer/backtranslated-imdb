You know that you are in trouble when the movie you see has many alternative titles. In general, this means that they have tried to hide the turkey in different markets. One such turkey is The Brain Machine, which has seven different titles. <br /> <br /> It's about a secret government project that is supposed to be able to use a computer to read people, but instead people are made to kill each other or themselves or something like that. It's full of B-level TV actors who sit in paneled rooms with lounge chairs trying to play a script that makes almost no sense. <br /> <br /> It is an unattractive type of turkey. Avoid it.
