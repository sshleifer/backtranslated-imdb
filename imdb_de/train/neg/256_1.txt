What? Is Jamie Foxx funny? Does he really think he is funny? Well, it's funny when he considers his self-confidence funny. The man has no identity ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he's really trying to imitate them in most of his movies. The only problem is that he makes it bad and irregular, and what comes out are some parts that he looks like Denzel with those machos. The hiring and then it abruptly goes to Martin Lawrence, the funny and awkward comedian. There's no personal connection to all this, I mean, he does not contribute to the personality he's trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say in person. He really is Mr. Dull-Boy personally. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping to have Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better off into a superstar, like Don Cheadle, but maybe The Poor Jamie better represents the generation remixing the old one.
