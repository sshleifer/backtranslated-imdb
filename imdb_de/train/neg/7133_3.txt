I felt like I saw the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a different story. I will say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So if you like fast cars, you'll probably find this movie entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from the days of our lives. She is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her so bad songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you have here on the radio. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to give that story a little lee, but in real life I do not think an average Joe would find such hot girls like Nadia Bjorlin driving a race car and fixing a car Be a motor and a singer. It's all very stupid. <br /> <br /> Another side note: Anyone willing to spend $ 25 million on a car race is a nut. But in the end, it was a bit cool when Natasha stopped in front of the finish line and screwed Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car enthusiasts. So if you like fast cars, I would recommend that.
