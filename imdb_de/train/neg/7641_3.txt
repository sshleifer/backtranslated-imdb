This is one of the movies that tries to be moody and tense and instead stumbles upon itself. After seeing it at a queer film festival, I was intrigued by the report "Young college threesome who went wrong," but overall, it was rather disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's hard to criticize a "true story" because there's not much to do in the plot - but I found this incoherent, melodramatic and utterly depressing, it's dark and almost scary It does not work - some scenes that are so kitschy that my listeners did not stifle the audience with subdued reverence, and their eyes wiggled miserably spiraling spiraling creepy lightning from the seventies with impressive music and jerky close-ups.
