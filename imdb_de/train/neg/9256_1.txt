Senselessly short over a bunch of half-naked men who hit and hit each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see that. It's turned in black and white, and tons of half-naked men are running around beating each other to terrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no action and really - the violence that comes with it became disturbing. Homo-eroticism is also played here, but mixing with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material may like it, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid, and (occasionally) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay short films and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go under 1.
