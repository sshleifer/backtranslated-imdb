This movie has some nice sets and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh as a daughter is too nervous and Olivia De Havillands far more nuanced, more sophisticated rendering in The Heiress (1949) is no match. The feminist bias of the film also contradicts the rigorous conclusion of the novel Washington Square, whose author Henry James brutally parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature I found this movie very disappointing.
