I saw this movie in a pre-release release at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As far as I remember, the producers and the director of the film were present, presumably to judge our reaction. Many scenes elicited loud laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy It was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not afraid, it was the filmmakers. They delayed her release by one year. Out of curiosity, I saw it again to see if they had recut it; As far as I can tell, they had not done so. It was the same lousy film, only a year older. <br /> <br /> It's almost described as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
