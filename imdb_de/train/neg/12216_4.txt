Do not get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the show as much as the movies, but it's enough: Death On The Nile. Everyone did that! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used this great talent in another novel by Agatha Christie. I will say that the acting of all the actors was excellent. The sets were great and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised how 'terrible' he looked. I hope he does not look like that in 'real life'! I honestly can not remember other films if the end was the same. I do not think so. I thought that was a pretty brilliant note, whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way. I would prefer that this end be wasted in prison!
