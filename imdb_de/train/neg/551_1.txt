I've gone through the AFI list of the 100 best comedies, and I have to say that this is really one of the worst. Not just from the 90 films on the list I've seen, but from all the films I've ever seen. Drunks are sometimes funny, Dudley not. Liza almost deserves it, but unfortunately ... look at Arrested Development if you want to see her well. Seriously, is Dudley laughing and drinking funny? I would recommend to almost every other movie on the 100 best comedies of the AFI for more laughs than this one. If you want to see a funny "drunk," try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general will kill any Marx Brothers movie (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
