I just saw this movie in HD on TV. I'm in a wheelchair for a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first I found the main character something noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the lifetime he has spent on recognizing the disabled and integrating them into the mainstream society's labor market is great. And my problem does not affect the real person who did these things. He was a great man. However, this film is completely hypocritical and resists exactly the message it preaches, and I found it offensive. <br /> <br /> First, they did not give anyone a title role with an actual physical disability. Sure, they were competent actors, but it seems absolutely spurious to preach to people with disabilities and then not really RENT for anything in the movie. In addition, in a scene in the middle of the film, a man with crutches is seen walking on a podium and seems to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so obvious that it's shameful. What? You could not find a true amputee for the movie anywhere? For a 5-second shot, it made more financial sense to make CGI effects than just hire an actual amputee. At this point in the film, I found it so fraudulently and completely against the message it tried to convey that I came here to complain and moan about it like the pathetic cripple that I am. <br /> <br /> Find out.
