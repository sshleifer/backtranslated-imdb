This is the kind of movie that you see in splayed silence with your claws open, and yet he keeps looking fascinated, as if he's ruining a train in slow motion. And in the back of his mind, the thoughts wavered: "Who illuminated this garbage on EARTH green?" <br /> <br /> Some of the previous user comments say things like, "A great way to introduce kids to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to kids everywhere. That children need a training plan to love slapstick comedy shows a deep misunderstanding about the nature of children around the world. Others have commented on the fidelity of the characterizations of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy, to which I would respond: So WHAT? You might think that the rash of the BOMBS based on popular series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, Ad Nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that just can not be recovered. The films by Laurel and Hardy are available on video: Why bother? <br /> <br /> As far as F. Murray Abraham is concerned, a good actor for stage and film ... Well, all I can say is that he has to be in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go away from the TV when this garbage shows up!
