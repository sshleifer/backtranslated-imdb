I'm not a horror movie freak, but my wife's nieces and nephews are. So I saw the first movie. It was cruel and tense but not my taste. Still good. For similar reasons, I am at this moment a continuation exposed. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is absolutely absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exist. I can even buy that the events could be so strange and strange that the military could decide to get involved. It's unlikely, yes, but I'm ready to expose my beliefs. However, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military team reconstructing such an area can not fend off the mutants As a member of the US Army, I can assure you that fresh recruits are the experienced ones Eyes and the experience of combat soldiers are missing, but these recruits are integrated into a capable squad. A troop of armed soldiers are not taken out by a few mutants with knives. That's how it works. Squad movements, far superior firepower and, of course, radio support would provide nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you will not have casualties, but once the terrain is classified as hostile, military training would have priority, and no one would set out to use the restroom themselves. <br /> <br /> And if it turned out that the area was so hostile that the squad could not handle the threat, they would turn it on for backup. And believe me, their radios would not be pinched. If there is a possibility that ordinary radios would not do so, the squad would have a military satellite phone. Chances are, if they can not check in every hour, a search is called. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous of the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, competent soldiers. Knife-based mutants are far below our ability to handle them. <br /> <br /> Since the entire film's performance depends on the unimaginable, the film can not deliver. Instead, it is expected that our soldiers, sailors and airmen will not be able to handle even the most mediocre of threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film insulting.
