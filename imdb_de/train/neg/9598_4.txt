Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known around the world as a worldwide television reporter. Less well-known, but equally tedious are his achievements as a full-time philanderer. <br /> <br /> I saw "Vivre pour Vivre" in English dubbed "Live for Life". A Living Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a mistress on the way out, one on the way in and the betrayed woman at home. It helps that Robert is a happy liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'm calling you tomorrow" and "My work took longer than planned." He spends a lot of time and money with planes, trains and hotel rooms for the sequence of his connections. Wondering when this guy can be caught with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some may find his life exciting, but I found it boring. His companions, including his wife Catherine, are all attractive and coveted women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceiving, you wonder if he enjoys it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to boredom is considerable material that does not promote the plot. There are extended sections without dialogue or only dialogue with French. We see documentaries about wars, torture and troop training, which are interspersed with the live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait for the plane to land and drive to the airport terminal. Annie Girardot is the outstanding performer in this film. She was the most interesting character and she played perfect. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can not find out anything about Yves Montand's performance about an amoral bum. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the novel techniques of Claude Lelouch. In a hotel room scene, the camera pans in the room while Robert and his lover argue. We see them briefly each time in the room. In another scene playing in a sleeper of a train, Robert lies on the upper bunk while his wife lies on the lower berth. Robert gives some important but worrying news to his wife, but we only hear parts of it because the train noise rattles. I sensed that his wife could not catch every word because of the shocking news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of these scenes and scenes in Amsterdam was outstanding. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project in the Library of Congress. I have named the project FIFTY: 50 remarkable films that have been forgotten within 50 years. As I can best see, like the other forty-nine I have identified, this film has not been broadcast on video, television or in the USA since its original release. In my opinion it is worth to be made available again. <br /> <br />
