This movie is just bad. It's not even worth making fun of it. The crazy professor is just annoying. Even if you exclude unbelief, to allow invisibility (which I like to make good bad movies), and allow extremely dumb victims in a horror movie, this movie demands even more. If you're looking for women's locker shower scenes and casual sexual encounters, get a porn, if you're looking for a good-bad movie, get something different. If you just want to waste your time with an annoying bad movie, rent it.
