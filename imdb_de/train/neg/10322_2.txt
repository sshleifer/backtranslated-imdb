If you are either offended or amused or looking for both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not even thought-provoking if you rework the usual stupid stereotypes. At the end of the second episode, I was a little embarrassed that I had actually been sitting through the thoughtful mess. Behind the faintly veiled gimmick that attracted initial attention, it was just another lame, harmless and antiseptic attempt to generate commentary and entertainment that usually accentuates the CBC in producing. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" The hustle takes off its welcome, the show is likely to end in the ether of denial, because it is so flat when judged only by its merits. I am easily amused by the smallest peculiarities on the subject. I really can not understand how LMOTP not only satisfies the curiosity created by the hype. Other exhibitions have dealt better with the problem of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never be among them in terms of entertainment or insight.
