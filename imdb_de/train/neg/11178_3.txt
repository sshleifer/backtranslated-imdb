First, I have to admit that it's not a good movie. And I would never see this movie if Pacino was not there. <br /> <br /> The film is about the strange 24 hours of a publicist. And he is overworked, dizzy, sick and sometimes regrets like the character at all. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. Just for the money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am an enthusiastic Pacino fan, I bought this film People I Know from the year 2002. If you have not bought it yet, do not think about it, it's just a waste of time.
