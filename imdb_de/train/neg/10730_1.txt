The movie starts with 3 people meeting in the bar. OK. They talk about their imaginary life, lying all the time for no reason. Still ok. From time to time they even make you laugh. Interesting. Actually enjoy the first 30 minutes! But then ... things get worse ... nothing happens for a long time ... and then, when something happens, you can only see naked old "ladies" touching each other! Not OK. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the film, but it's all but that! Film does not make sense, it is boring and sick! The strangest thing is that this movie (Belgrade, Serbia) at the FEST (Filmfestival) after researching was of course the most popular movie before people looked at it! I even thought (before watching): "Hay, that might be interesting, even though it's a Russian movie!" But, God, no!
