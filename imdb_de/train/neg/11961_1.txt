Those who could find redeeming value in this bitch should have their heads examined. We have the submissive, heroin addicted, part-time whore woman with lacerated wounds all over her body, who were sustained by repeated beatings of an abusive son. Now she's squirting mother's milk all over the kitchen floor, and so salvation has become like Helen Keller putting her hands in running water. We have the husband who begins to patronize a prostitute who happens to be his daughter (she is upset because he came too fast) and ends up killing his colleague, having sex with her corpse and then hacking her , We have the child ruthlessly bullied by his classmates and comes home and beats his mother. You see, it's all round. Deep, right? The only decent moment in this terrible triangle pile is when the father murders his son's tormentors. It's a good thing that this turkey was shot on video, otherwise it would be a waste of expensive movies. If the guy who thinks artists are interested in this slopp is really serious, it's no wonder most people believe that artists are crazy. We saw this lousy movie and then released "Zero Woman, The Accused". Oh my god, it was a call which was worse. What's going on in Japan these days? Ill, ill, sick.
