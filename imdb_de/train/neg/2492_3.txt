I think I saw worse movies, so I give a 3, but it's hard to remember what they could have been !! It may be Xtro (evil & boring) or possibly Creep (just boring), but it's hard to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man who's the bottom line. Jean Claude Van Damme, an even poorer man. The only redeemer was seeing Casper Van Dien - I've always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Based on this website, he got stuck in the TV movie Hell. !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just fell over and there is a reasonably decent movie called Criminal Law ...... now I'm starting to really annoy the last 1.5 hours !!!
