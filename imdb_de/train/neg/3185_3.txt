This movie was just forced by MST3K and for good reason. First of all, because it's a "cop" movie with Joe Don Baker, whom we all know is as good as a cop actor, since Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical police film devices harbor their ugly heads, bar brawls, kidnapping children in shootouts, bad drama, lame police chiefs, bad drama, revenge / justice, endless thugs and of course bad acting. Do not look at this without an MST3K filter.
