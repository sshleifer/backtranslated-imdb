Despite pretty bad reviews I just had to try this movie? after all, it's a star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovers as a team of all-action burglars. That's worth it? Well, while baby festivals are going on, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is of the highest quality. Shu Qi looks just as fantastic as ever, and Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang were particularly noticed by the other girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if you want to judge this film for other possible merits It is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action low and the special effects pitiful. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and more. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you see this movie, it's better to watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
