After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is all in films like El Segundo Nombre, a TV-like production that was poorly written, but did worse and directed. I did not read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll, who ate his mother, did not have much to do with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you are looking for a quiet, sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2.10
