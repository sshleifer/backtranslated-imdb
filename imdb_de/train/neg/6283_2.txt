What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> They gather some friends at home, all of whom are incited by the follow-up work of Sean Ellis. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes pass and you tell yourself it's going to pick you up, at 25 minutes ask yourself if you should just go to sleep and save it for another time, if you have the expected, nonexistent subtle touches fully appreciate. After half an hour, you realize that half of your hyped audience is already asleep, and call it a day. A few days later, when you use up all the other material to see how you return, in the middle of the day, this time with the hope that your mood will keep you awake. 10 minutes later you will be transporting the incredibly and unnecessarily long crossings and pictures forward. I would have given up everything else, but there is cashback and his legacy. But this legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of boring filmmaking. Imagine a short story that has been extended to a novel with pure descriptions. This is what it is. Decent Casting Wasted There is no camera that leaves you in awe like Cashback. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately, this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final words, stay away.
