Oh dear, what a disappointment. I have seen old Westerns on British television for decades and until yesterday I was unaware - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years and usually pay off again. <br /> <The rich colors and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments. I felt like switching it off several times, and eventually I did it halfway, something I hardly do. Scott seemed unusually greasy if he charmed the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and also the Mexican bandit boy. And I have the feeling that the uniforms of the army were 20 years too modern, not that it bothered the makers of many other westerns Has. <br /> <br /> Maybe it got better in the second half, but I could not bother to wait and see.
