My friends and I rented this movie last night, and we had one of the biggest laughs for some time. The movie should not be funny at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism. First, Phillippe (forgetting his character's name and I do not really care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the terminals with the highest security. Not only is this miserable, but it is also surpassed when his tremendous efforts make him find the frightening lego room that houses the supercomputers. That's just funny. The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoiled by the childish-looking space. The end, like everything else, is very cheesy, especially when the bad man's lawyer shows up "on time." Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you want to make fun of something, you will definitely see it.
