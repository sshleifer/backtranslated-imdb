I did not really enjoy this movie <br /> <br /> I saw him in a camp and we did not praise it, we laughed about it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the drama is terrible, the effects are terrible and the whole movie idea is awful (now, I know, it was based on a book I did not read, but I hope the book was better as that, because I honestly thought that this movie is very bad and boring, as I said, I went with a few people from a camp and we were excited to be there, and I got a caffeinated drink, but the only thing that kept me up (apart from my fear of being embarrassed after waking up) was the shots, which were pretty pointless, I just did not like it.
