(also known as: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television, though filmed in English and was never intended as a sequel to earlier DEMONS films. It was supposed to carry the title THE OGRE just as director Lamberto Bava had released it. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl descending into the old wine cellar of this mansion, encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It glows and is covered with cobwebs and has something that looks like spider or insect legs. It drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course the husband does not believe any of this. The villa is just old and creaky and makes strange noises in the middle of the night, and she should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in a kind of 16 centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it, and the scent of orchids attracts them. <br /> <br /> The movies are not really that bad and at least the dialogue is reasonably intelligent, without the ridiculous awkward phrases that sync brings with it. There's no real thrill save some skeletons rotting in an underground pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself simply disappears after being run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I looked at was broken. The picture went black after a half hour in the movie for a few seconds, a mistake I hope Shriek has since been corrected. Extras include a brief interview with Lamberto Bava, explaining that this was not a sequel, etc., etc., as well as some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases. This is pretty normal stuff. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
