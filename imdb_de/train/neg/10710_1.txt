Dolph Lundgren plays a role as a Templar who comes to New York when an archaeologist finds a key to deciphering the anti-Christ system. Of course, the demon is just a few miles behind Dolph and is not easily killed when it changes body to body. Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is totally unsurpassable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I always try to watch his movies whenever they are on TV. I caught The Minion and the boy was ever disappointed. This movie is absolutely terrible. With such badly staged and poorly edited action sequences, you can hardly make sense in the arena. The worst part is that Lundgren's unsatisfactory perfection as a tough priest (!) Makes it all worse that the movie was such a rip-off of traps (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad but better than this) overall Film is the worst movie I've seen of Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend. It's awful and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out Of 4- (Awful)
