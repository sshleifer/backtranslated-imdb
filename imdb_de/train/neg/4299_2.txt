This is one of the terrible, sex-driven B-movies that could not have been played near a theater. Women walk around in lightly dressed "bunny" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes, and they all work in the restaurant of a dirty old man who has a strange son (Jim Hanks, of course) Tom's brother) the man wants to "lay". Hanks is actually good, but this movie is not going anywhere and has no meaning. You have to wonder why it was done at all? Due to Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but no more than a few), he received an outstanding "2" out of 10. However, I think I was nice.
