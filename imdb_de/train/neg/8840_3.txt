Here's the perfect example of what you should not do if you have a great idea. That's not the problem? The concept is fresh and full of possibilities, but the script and execution lack real substance. It should grab you from the beginning and then put a little strain on your emotions, interest you for the interest and investment in the characters. This movie does not have what it takes to lift and sustain the flight, and here's the reason. At first, you're not really interested in the characters because they're not presented in a way people can relate to. I mean, that's not Superman or Mission Impossible. These are normal people who are in a stressful situation. They do not believe in how they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs, a chewing cop, is chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time. I mean, what is that ?, he looks like he's in the bathroom or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he played the intense / neurotic, unrecognized medical genius was right with the money. But not too much, he tries to compensate too much by looking so intense and nervous, but in a mild, neurotic way it's not natural. I'm surprised he did not adjust his jaw during the movie. The movie is essentially about living, it has barely a pulse and has made me wait for something that would never come.
