I finally saw THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 years to see it. THE INCUBUS is a strict horror film: Countless murderers / monsters rape and murder women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like this: The movie begins with the killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continue with bla bla bla; another murder (surprisingly, what?); bla bla bla, etc ... <br /> <br /> The movie is completely predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid "big" herring used throughout the movie failed to convince a 5-year-old. The moment I saw the figure, I found out the secret identity of the incubus. When the surprise ended "shockingly," I was neither shocked nor surprised. Actually, it was so funny that I had to laugh for a few days after the movie. It is so stupid! Anyway, the movie is so number one that the "rock band" scene is one of the few outstanding moments in this dreary movie. It's a flashy scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so funny and meaningless: the movie that's on the big screen shows a rock-video-like moment when a man in a red leather pants is showing his obviously wrong haircut This was edited with scenes of a girl who is attacked by the incubus in the laundry room of the cinema. The best thing I could say about this movie is the camera I really liked. Apart from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS except that it's unintentionally funny.
