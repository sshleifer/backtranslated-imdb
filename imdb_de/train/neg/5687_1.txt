While not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations, this guy does not fare much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to accept a pathological inability to make good movies. One day he will run out of money and stop burdening the world with his bombs. <br /> <br /> The acting was below average, the dialogue sounded like they read TelePrompTer and Boll's special little touches. were seen in the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll movies, this movie just should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll herself, there should not be. > _>
