Well, this is a typical "Sloher movie" that goes straight to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Long story, a bunch of teens / young adults stranded in spooky woods and hacked by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the basics for this Slasher vonage: <br /> <br /> - Naked women, teens or young adults who are stuck in a place with sinister, creepy death scenes - the last one Survivor is a well-built young woman who will always show her belly, but never a bra less, -a scary, crazy man who knows about evil, -lesbian kissing scene, -sex is a murderer, -no conspiracy /> <br /> Even for a cheesy Slasher movie, it was really awful. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to interest the male and lesbian female audience. When I saw it, it felt like it was being watched with a bad head overload or a bad head cold. <br /> <br /> Give the demonic ... 0/10.
