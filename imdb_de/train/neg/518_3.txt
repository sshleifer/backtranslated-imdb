Bela Lugosi is not a guy in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series. He plays the lead role as Frank Chandler / Chandu, the magician, and enjoys his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic, who oppressed against the forces of Black, while showing a strong martial arts courting a young Egyptian princess and a slender and dashing Figure in sailcloth cut, complete with sea cap. The somewhat crude conspiracy attacks Chandler / Chandu in a series of antics aiming to save his fiancé Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the idol worship sect of Ubasti, who seeks to revive Nadji's blood animate an old mummified Princess on the mysterious island Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand in such conversations, keeps the events moving, but it does repeat scenes and footage, much of which can be found in last year's Skull Island setting by KING KONG and the port area of ​​SON OF KONG. Reduces the original action to less than 60 minutes for a series runtime of more than two and a half hours, and becomes ineffective for most viewers at a session if it is not sleepless.
