Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone trying to come out. While Cube was taut, good-natured, claustrophobic, and startling, I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious reconditioning of various well-trodden topics that just do not yield much, especially if you've seen nearly all the other halfway decent sci-fi movies. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to pull himself through the relatively short 95 minutes to the incompetent end. None of the characters ignite each other and for a movie from 2002, the technology is really cheesy. It's hard to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good one. <br /> <br /> If you grow the grass and dry it and get bored with your stick insects, you should definitely watch this movie. The other activities, however, will prove more exciting.
