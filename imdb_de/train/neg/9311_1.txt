The cover on the DVD and the CD is crazy. You would think they made a movie about sweet tooth made of twisted metal black, which is still a really great idea, but the actors of this movie are worst off as Pearl's Pearl performance. Porn has better quality and better actors. I wanted to buy the DVD, but luckily I rented it first. The storyline and the script are also terrible. Nothing seems to go together, so the movie really does not make sense. The bad attempts to scare you into Flashback scenes are worse than those used in 80s sitcom shows, and in the end you'll want to bang your head against the wall of your house.
