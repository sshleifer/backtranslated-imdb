Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I've seen a lot of promotional material and I'm expecting a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I was presented with was a low budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more than worse fight scenes. Some good ideas - nothing more. I hope I get the chance to make a movie like this, and then I show how to make such a movie! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
