Mere thoughts of "Going Overboard" (aka "Babes Ahoy") make me cry. Throwing yourself out of the window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed "so bad is it good" movie. I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can not see it. Oh the pain, the pain ...
