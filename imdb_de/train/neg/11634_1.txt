I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, together with the great dr. Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The movie is just very, very bad. And no, not in the usual way of Uwe Boll "it's actually so entertaining", but just bad. The plot is about a man who leads a terrible life (apparently due to a previous criminal record), can not get a job and cheats on a terrible 900-pound woman. This man turns to his uncle with the cult leader to steal a truckload of toys containing the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has plans to steal the toys, and the following is barely two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful (except for Dave Foley, who really tries it anyway)), the jokes never rise above kids who are shot in the chest in slow motion and people who take a poo , It's supposed to be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think of "Airplane!" but from the makers of South Park and without any jokes.
