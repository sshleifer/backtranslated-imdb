'Chances are' to see a big mistake. You could meet director Emile Ardolino of 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something funny from him. But I think I have to disillusion you. He made a really bad movie. According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to recycle as a baby. The baby grows up with Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his former hometown, where she meets his former daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love. Then his former wife, Cybill Shepherd, appears, and Jr falls in love with her as well. I guess I do not have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. is on his worst side. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd has proved that she is not suitable for films. Anyway, there's one thing that can be used with this listless comedy: as an antidote to insomnia.
