R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the Master. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely awful. <br /> <br /> No end; no closure. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> I hate this totally unrealistic, unedited, unwritten, undirected, unproductive confusion of a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just found out that they made a second one? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for their hatred of their films. This mess makes these movies just bad - not terribly awful and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie I've ever said that for - REMOV IT OF NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
