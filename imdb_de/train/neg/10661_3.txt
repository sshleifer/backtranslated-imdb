It is "The F.B.I". with Reed Hadley in the lead role, with a star guest actor! The film begins with a casual (convenient?) Abduction that leads to one thing and another - which does not really indicate the main story, namely a "Big House, USA". Prison break history. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a TV show, just "violent" (for the time being). <br /> <br /> BUT - the cast is a journey! Imagine: Ralph Meeker is sent to jail; His cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a "muscle" magazine!), And William Talman (reading a "Detective" magazine!). Honestly! You should know that an early scene shows what happens to the "missing" boy and answers the ending with "voiceover". If you do not want to hang that down, do not miss the opening scenes between the "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian is a great asthmatic). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch - Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
