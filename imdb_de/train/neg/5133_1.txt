I had no real expectations for this movie and I'm glad. Even if I expected it to go bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? First, I believe that 15% of the film was stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle area. I get it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing is said damn about scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. There are too many where I had WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the movie takes itself seriously. I'm all for a B-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these movies often know that they are B movies and even show them, like Dead Snow (funny zombie Skandan from Skandanavian) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie does not seem to know its shit should be more blood and / or nudity , Yes, I said it. If you want a crap horror movie, kill it. And if you have a hot and a half-hot girl, one of them has to show at least a few side breasts. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrows". and just plug each other in the eye. You will thank me.
