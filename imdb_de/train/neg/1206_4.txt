This long lost thought is sometimes available on the internet. So I bought a copy. Of course, the spectacle is terrible and the plot is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who were looking for it also know the background story. It was created by a Grindhouse movie theater owner for an extremely low budget. But for me he certainly did not spoil the money with props, but with the make-up. The make-up is well done for this type of movie. The zombies can be seen and the blood is intact. The only problem with this type of film is the quality of the pelicule. It's awful, luckily no hiss, but sometimes it's way too dark. So you have to look closely to see the blood. In a funny way, they have tried to sell them as really not for the squeamish ones. A voice-over says at the beginning of the film that you have to look for a sign and a man who appears with green lightning telling you that Gore is on the way. Of course, that does not work, I had to think of Cannibal Girls, had this annoying bell, as the red stuff began to flow. They had the original idea Cannibal Girls was made a year before. Do not go for the plot, go to the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. When the girl and the guy first fall in love, she takes her bra, then she makes love and suddenly her underwear is back on ... try that, or I'll be a bit off-line ... eat it, you ugly corpses
