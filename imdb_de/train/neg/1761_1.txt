First, I find that a "1" rating should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film gets that from me because, as one reviewer states, it's not bad in a confident, exaggerated way that may have some comic or cult value. With each count she simply misses her tracks. ** Contains possible spoilers. ** The dialogue is completely unremarkable. The continuity is so conscious that it is painful. Daniel is just talking about his lost love and with his last word the flamenco dancers start. The bogus shock of her name (see, I can not even remember the name of her character, not to mention the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) tells her for the first time that her girlfriend is the Villain is. The car and the motorcycle hunts did everything right. Vegetable carts flew away. Cars crash into each other. Motorcycles go down the stairs. The people are almost affected, but no one is remarkable. Oh, that's right ... except for the one man stabbed several times, he's obviously stumbling at the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car did not seem to notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more remarkable that films like this one can be made. There's so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you'd think someone in Hollywood would think to make good films that are worth seeing. Now there is a novel idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not borrow the DVD. Do not look at the cable. There are many other things you could do to make you feel happier.
