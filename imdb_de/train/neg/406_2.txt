This movie was always about the fantastic graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have gone on to make the screenplay disappear, then the stupid sentence, and finally all the visible elements of that movie. Because there is nothing else to show. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe will be screenplaying this movie. I do not think they exist. I think they bought this script from "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard "Monster Movie" blank and just fill in the blanks. There is a monster that haunts us. Let us share. (She "let's split up in this movie"). Meet Alien / Giant Bug / Monster / Invisible Man with Crowbar. Not yet dead. Burn Giant Rabbit / Shark / Invisible in Insurmountable Fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard material. Even the minimal number of elements that were specific to an invisible male movie (IR glasses, spraying with some paint) was treated badly. <br /> <br /> What's sad is that there were many opportunities for a fascinating movie. They had psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, the treatment of an invisible topic and many other ideas were usually addressed for less than 2 seconds and would have been much more interesting. If there had been any desire to save Kevin Bacon, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk. <br /> <br /> I would mention some incredibly stupid elements of the movie's ending, but I do not want to spoil. Suffice to say that these characters are so stupid that they do not think to pull the plug on a machine instead ...
