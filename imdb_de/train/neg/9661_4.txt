I want to say that acting is bad, but I think it was the director who made it that way. I've never thought much of Highlander (the same director), but you could blame the 80s. <br /> <br /> However, this one has no excuses. People are shot at leaving the ditches with a man in front of him !? These kinds of mistakes, along with an unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, sub-par excellence, and poor visual effects make this movie a super movie. Everything like everyone else commented on this whole American bullshit. The German general was practically afraid of his imprisoned American private life. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, albeit in small doses. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a not terrible but still below-average war movie in all its aspects.
