I really like the cast, but the story is developing pretty slowly. Danny Glover does a good job and wonders if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have as much room in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a little over the top compared to the story. I would still look at it again. I rated it at 5 (I wish I could rate it at 5.5)
