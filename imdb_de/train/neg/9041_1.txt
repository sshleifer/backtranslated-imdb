I liked the movie somehow, though it's very fast. BUT I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was called Montana North. It's definitely NOT Montana North and it never will be. Americans are wondering why they are considered arrogant in the rest of the world, and that's one of the reasons. Stop teaching the children of the United States of America to believe that they own the planet. Such a centrist world view does not become one of the great nations of the world. Also in jest. I would never call the US "Alberta South". Walt would never let us down, so start now. Otherwise, the film was pretty stupid, next time more luck.
