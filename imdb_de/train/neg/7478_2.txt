When I saw previews of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but at least it will be funny. I was wrong. Even though the producers somewhere in the depths conveyed an interesting message about their parents and reevaluated their lives, the way in which they tried to convey this message was terrible. The first fifty times when something foolish happened to the couple, it was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict what kind of stupid mishap will happen next. <br /> <br /> During the film, I like a total of five lines of dialogue and everything else was mediocre at best, which is still the case more than I can say for the movie itself.
