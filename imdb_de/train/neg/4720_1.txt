When I saw this "documentary" I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda again. Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main reason for dissolving Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" made by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film is far from being objective , It is one of the lies that are being pushed by the Milosevic regime. All others are guilty, only the Serbs were right and victims, even though most of the war criminals in The Hague are Serbs, even though the Serbs have committed genocide against the Bosnians and have attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, all independent nations Nations were unavoidable because the Serbs did not want to give up the grip of their nationalism on the government of the state of Yugoslavia. That is why Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia have been forced to become independent states to protect their interests. I am interested in an objective documentary about the break-up of Yugoslavia. They should see "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", Made by Discovery Channel and BBC.
