If it smells like garbage and looks like rubbish, it has to be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's bad directing style shames an already uninteresting and untrue story about Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing. Certain aspects of the conspiracy were ridiculous and absolutely incredible. It seems that all the action scenes were loosely strung together by bad action points and terrible spectacles. Keira Knightley is totally naked in this case though. That's the only advantage of this movie. If you want to see her naked, rewind the movie for up to an hour and a half and you'll catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that nobody will ever see this movie! </ 3
