I never understood Garbo's appeal. In her films, she always looks like she is not very tempting and this annoying voice that could drown out the tuba range. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson was much better in the quiet times. In her last film, her performance is very average and self-confident. She strives hard, but it comes to nothing, because the script is even worse than her acting. <br /> <br /> A would be a screwball Romcom who is never believable and never gets on his feet (though Melvyn Douglas manages to experience the ski scenes that are really the only fun (here). <br /> < br /> There was potential, but the script fails in almost every department and wastes every actor in. Douglas and Garbo had enough chemistry, but this one is not even a point on Ninotchka, which I found extremely overrated.
