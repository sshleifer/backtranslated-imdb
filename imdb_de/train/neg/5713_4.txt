There is nothing worse than borrowing an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller relies on establishing likable, intelligent characters. As for sympathy, the protagonists in Say Yes are a curious couple. Nicely done. Unfortunately, they are incredibly stupid. Let's count how they are mistreated when terrorized by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker has threatened to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you are in when you drop him off. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses and allow him to file charges of assault. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother to tell the police about the stalker, and just assume (for no good reason) that the cops have been bribed by him. <br /> <br /> 4. As far as possible, keep your wife out of sight while trying to escape to make sure the stalker hijacks you. <br /> <br /> 5. After helping someone find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, you must send him away as soon as possible so you can see him one on one. No reason to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Well, I would never expect anyone to be immune to some mistakes under these stress conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it's virtually impossible for them the viewer to care about their safety as they are victims of their own actions. This destroys the fun of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In the event that you wondered, the scriptwriters did not stop with mindless characters. Since they are themselves idiots themselves for writing this Crapfest, they have decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that every sense of reality comes out the window. <br /> <br /> 1. The stalker kills a policeman in a police station? while the protagonist sleeps no more than three feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in bright daylight and around people, but no one except the couple seems to notice his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives an absurd force that would have killed anyone. <br /> <br /> 4. The "exciting" scenes had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is the beheading towards the end, which was pretty brutal as it was inflicted on the woman. It's too bad that the filmmakers have made an outrageously stupid end to themselves. <br /> <br /> The Koreans behind Say Yes should be ashamed. Better yet, they should just move to California and engage with people who make films with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
