Well, I think the good news from William Winckler's opus "The Double-D Avenger" in 2001 is that he manages to get three of Russ Meyer's mammoth wonder - Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one picture combine. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they did this thing ... or they managed to see a copy of the script before!) The bad news ( and there's plenty of it) is that this movie - if you can even say it was shot directly on video - is a complete misfire, a total abortion, a thoroughly cruel atrocity, an absolute abomination and really one of the worst images I have ever seen. Look no further for the lameest superhero movie ever made! The plot here as it is deals with Kitten's superpowers, after plunging the rare cockacilla plant in South America to heal her breast cancer, and later fights against a trio of megalanced bikini dancers in LA joke trotted out completely (you should forgive the expression) flat out that there is really nudity in the movie ZERO (except a few old photos of kittens in their heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier mache boulder are the sum of the special FX. The Meyer girls here are a bit long in the mouth / limp in the chest, to put it nicely, though Sheri Dawn Thomas as a bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!) It manages, uh, to get up nicely. Why did I give this youthful, unpleasant, failed fix of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To cut a long story short: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary on the peculiarities of the DVD I've just watched is utterly weird, especially when he pulls out about 100 synonyms for the word "chest" from the 1,000+ on the Canonical Hooters List on his website , The man is a national treasure, and he manages to improve that skeet of a slice to the coaster status!
