This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. Pure blabber. How someone can connect with the heroine or has compassion for them, is not me. I felt I was watching the case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce film and produce "art" - unless I could find no art in it for my life at all. <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in the world today, she would have been taken to a mental institution and treated with antipsychotic medication for a few days. That or just allows you to roam the streets and become a sack woman. Why other characters in the film found something salutary for them - and wanted to help them in their search for an actress - speaks more for their pathology than for their compelling qualities worthy of the effort.
