The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least, all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time I spent through this bomb. The crew member responsible for continuity missed the boat. As the female lead and the FBI man walked to the alleged murder site, Mr. FBI handed the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver magically turned into an automatic. You have to consider if an FBP agent would give a weapon to a civilian? I do not think so. Ms. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's too bad the R-rating did not see much of her. It seems a movie editor has cut out the best parts of the movie.
