Oh man. This movie would have the subtitle "If strikers strike!" What a stinker. I really had high hopes, mostly after reading IMDb reviews, which surprised me about the whole IMDb rating system, but that's another matter. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, and so on, so I expected big things. To say I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are so many things that are out of line with this movie, but I limit myself to (a) the implausibility of a family behaving like these people (an aerobic mass training, on what planet is real life ?), The awkward script (a love killer? Please), and the fact that Dan's character is so unlikely that you wonder what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This movie was full of chunky dialogues, creaky directions and ridiculous scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have gone out after half an hour if we had not been with my parents, who did not come out much and wasted no money. Unlike the creators of this film, it would have been better to throw all the money spent on making this film into a campfire - that would have been more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid them like the plague.
