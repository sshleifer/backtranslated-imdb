First of all, I would like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in the eyes of laughter. A comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is correct. MST3000 has benefited from it. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader from 1959, you've got this jerk under control. All elements are there: the pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often humorous childish. The attitude of the adolescent boy towards sex, with the "Gigolo" captain (good name, boys!), Who sees the urgent "scientist" so red-haired that it is a miracle that it does not trigger a fire alarm. The ridiculous notion of Mars as a planet so alien that everything lights up red, but an alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye that turns like a child's toy. The Comic Relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who sounds like he's never finished class 8 in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his jet cannon. And of course the mere fact that aliens are dangerously dangerous. If these people E.T. they would have roasted it in two seconds! "OW" indeed! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still, it's never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make it more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit that you have to jump a few times in your little kid's core. <br /> <br /> Okay, do not admit it. I think you were never 10 years old.
