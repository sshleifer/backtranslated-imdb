Return of the Boogyman is a horrible movie that does not sound like a movie. He plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when he looks back on older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show. <br/> <br /> The mood of the movie is constant and annoying the flashbacks of the first movie. Again and again the same footage. How boring that is. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie I did not want to see the same scenes over and over and I do not know who would. The whole movie looks like it was made fast to make a few bucks, and that's it.
