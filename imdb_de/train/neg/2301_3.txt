Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it annoy only the people who see it? When I leaf through the canals and come across this show, I hold myself out of curious curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. What I do not know is whether its viewers are like him or are good people and believe that they will have a better life listening to what he has to say. Pat Roberson is of little importance. He is an old man who thinks in the old way. Fear of damnation does not have the same effect as it used to (thank god). If someone answers my question, I'll dodge lightning for the rest of eternity.
