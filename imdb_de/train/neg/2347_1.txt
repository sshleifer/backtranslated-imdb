Let me first say that I'm a big fan of Ashley Judd. That's why I was curious to see this debut role. No argument that her talent is obvious and her performance is outstanding. I think I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies should entertain us, and at this point this movie fails. <br /> <br /> At half-time, I thought, "How long do we have to be boring, store girl standing idly around an abandoned souvenir shop, sorting the goods?" It seemed to go on forever! <br /> <br /> Then I thought, maybe this is one of those movies in which the director tries to bring the audience into a relaxed state before meeting them with a dynamic event. No such luck. The film continues its boring, boring, uneventful story until the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that because I'm an action junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home videos. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how anyone could like this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
