What about the dull video at the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's like someone putting muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> The violence and nudity may scare off some people, but along with the mostly bad acting, this is probably a good cult movie, I think /> <br /> My favorite line is supplied by Tarquin, the vampire: "Unfortunately, your breed is stupid." Okay, nobody should say "unfortunately" in a film series, unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The acting of the Van Helsing character and the bad girl "Rally" is not the case Bad. I also liked Master Little, played by Ron Little. Wicked Martial Arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
