My wife and I both thought this movie is a watered-down version of Manhattan Murder Mystery (BBC) for the TV ... which is good, but not great. The story has little tension or chemistry and no big story. Woody Allen's character just walks around and runs away at the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson are not much to do anymore. It's pretty disappointing, I have to say. Ian McShanes role is just an extended cameo. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to my mind was "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to free him from Manhattan?" He must have needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market, which is attracted by the two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unpleasant background noise. If you want something in the knitting or sorting of your stamp collection, this will do the job. I would not pay to rent it again.
