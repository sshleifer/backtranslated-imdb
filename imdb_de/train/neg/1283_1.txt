I have to say that the first movie I saw for the first time was about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it back then. I bought the DVD recently and wondered a second time why I liked it. The acting was terrible and as usual we have the stereotypes in their fake costumes. The drama was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job, as did Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot was good, but the execution was just bad. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed in the movies like this. Braveheart, however, was even worse, which only saves the movies. But seriously, people did not talk that way at the time, why do all the actors have to have glassy accents? Another film to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I find that the only people who have approved this film are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they like it, I know that they have a crush on men in kilts. However, if you remember to buy the DVD, I would say that you should spend your money on something else, such as a better movie.
