Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, honey, do you understand? This is called senseless premonition. Edward Basket: Huh? (On the street) Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really should not be so careless with your stuff. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Noise! Crackle?? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What the?? ? (Tear open the letter) Wow! The handwriting of my ex-girl has really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks a bit like the girl with the doll, which I accidentally somehow blamed for being killed in some way. And she has my hairline somehow. I wonder, should I torture myself and seek her? Let's see what my friends think in the area. <br /> <br /> Baskets Mate: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the Island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Baumstammler: It's not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you swing that? Big-boned, tree called Tavern wench: Huh? Basket: (smashes a bee). Everything is OK. <br /> <br /> Sensual pretty, once promising actress playing a fun inn: That's good. Honey is not a plant. <br /> <br /> Willow: Oh yes, and I forgot, you're the father, my child, Conan, um, I mean, Rowen. (Yawns) I could have stayed and had a life with you. But I did not do it. I wanted to be princess of the hive instead. I mean, no matter. (Nods, jerks, turns eyes into anime proportions). Mwah, kiss kiss. Love you! What did we talk about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Flash. Why. Are. You. Shouting. At the. Me? Is it because I jacked up your Vicodin? Sniff. Snoring. What did we talk about? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (In the classroom) Rose: What is a man? Uninteresting twins in harmony: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Get off the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (At the hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh, bother. Stupid old bear. Snoring. <br /> <br /> (In the Beekeeper's Mansion) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Were not you the stallion that Cher hit in Moonstruck's face? (Licking her lips.) Basket: I wanted to ask you right away. Where is the girl sister Summersisle: How you threaten. Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous "s". Basket: Watch out for this tractor-trailer! Aaaah! Oh. Never mind. Goddamn! (Slams another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (back in the tavern) Thick-skinned taunting tavern: I tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and since last year I still have a bear suit. <br /> <br /> Woman named by tree: HAHAHA. All the better that this curious policeman is being fried in me, dear. <br /> <br /> Thick Bitch: Totally. <br /> <br /> Basket: That was the last straw that pulled the basket case back! Take that, girl! (Hurls her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind.) Lush Tavern Female: EEEE! Let it out! Leave the island and take me with you! Do I have to attack you or what? Grab it, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take that, girl! (Kicking her face boldly) Her eyes roll back into her head and turn into a caricature X.) Voluptuous wench: Snore ?? (At Nicolas Cage Roast) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part in which Basket's cell phone rings in the middle of his bear suit scene and then the call is dropped. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And do you remember when I made the bullets I pulled from Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your things, Nick. Hahaha. And your film selection. <br /> <br /> All: The drone must die! Basket: (yells) Oh, you bitches? Well, roasting me will not help your goddam treasure! Aaah My legs! Honey (darling, do you understand?) Put down the torch and step out of the wicker suitcase. Honey! Smokebear says do not play with matches. Hahaha. What the??? Look for the latching truck! Ahh! Oh. Damn it, these flashbacks from my drug experiment phase in the seventies are getting old! Where is my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad will happen. Can you hear me now? I am ready for my close-up. Goddamn! (Six months later) Voluptuous slut in a modern, sloppy robe: I told the basket case of the same name to take me with me. Innocent young drone: I like to help people. <br /> <br /> Volptuous wench: Then get me out of my contract for the sequel! I think something bad will happen. EEEEE!
