Haunted Boat sells as "The Fog" meets "Open Water". In many ways this is true. There are scared and weird-looking people who keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the acting ability is bad at best. Clear evidence shows that this is just a bunch of friends making a horror movie. Whatever credit they do to the best of their ability. If you accept the low budget, it's very difficult for special effects, where the ghosts look a lot like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are scary and weird. But it suffers when you use too many twists and turns in too short a time, which makes you bored and confused. In terms of wakefulness, the movie does that very well. If you ignore the irrelevant twist at the end every 5 seconds, you really want to know what's going on. And are ready to wait the 1 hour and 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a Ghost Ship, but it will definitely be for an evening in front of the TV channel T.V.
