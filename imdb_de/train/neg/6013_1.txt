I've read every book in the series left to this day, and the movie does not do any of them justice. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but that was unbelievably disappointing. This movie would have resulted in a good MST3K episode. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines rather than actually saying it. The characters were stiff and unlikely. The effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake. The end was terrible. At first, it did not even go through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you had not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It had to be the cheesiest end of a movie that looked like a movie student. I'm upset that I actually paid money for this movie. If it is spread by a miracle, they should completely overtake it and let Hollywood take over. These two would-be film producers and the would-be director should leave the film production to the professionals.
