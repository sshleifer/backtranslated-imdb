The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved he had only a good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolutely lowest common denominator humor. Painful contemplation A complete task. No doubt written in less than a week, just like the first. Give Meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him out until he has developed a decent script for anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Drop Gold Member Without Traces.
