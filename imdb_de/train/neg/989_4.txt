Okay, I learned something about this movie and saw the preview read almost all the reviews, and it was hard for me to debate whether to watch it or not. Before I saw the movie, I was emotionally strange. I was so unsure if I would look at it and be bothered for a long time. So I decide to take the risk and saw what I thought: the beginning started well for me. It seemed to be going in a decent direction. I passed the rape scene and could not understand why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Do not get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but that did not really bother me dramatically. When the center came in, I understood the boring stuff that was going on. There were about 5 minutes of shots of anything besides the people who were walking around and saying nothing or pointing! It's one thing to have an attitude where a person shows emotions, but this movie did not have that. There were about three of those pointless scenes in which the main character Maya got out of control, but it did not turn out right, which made me want to be rash. When she got into the hardcore parties, it was not so boring, but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a comment, Rosario Dawson has still done a good job. Okay, finally, after an hour of futility in the middle, Maya becomes aware of the revenge. It was disturbing there. I did not feel bad for him or anything he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I just felt like it. I can not really tell you if I should watch this movie or not because it is so ... I do not know that I can not find a word to sum it up. But if you decide to see it, do not be surprised.
