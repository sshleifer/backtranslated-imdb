Irene Dunne ended her illustrious career with this film. She should have been out with a bang, the noble actress she was, not in this unforgettable, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is okay, but nothing special. The first half is much better, as she gets pretty stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and stop. Even her high voice was a bit annoying here. Rumor had it that she was not satisfied with this film. You can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Speaking of: I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie & Harriet TV series would be in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson. <br /> <br /> All in all so-so and at best a minor ending for a great actress.
