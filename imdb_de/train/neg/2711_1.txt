Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally experienced every significant moment of the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson family and nobody died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly awful. I got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and the movies of Oliver Stone from the 60s again and again. A Canadian television critic described the conclusion of the first episode as "head spinning". He was right.
