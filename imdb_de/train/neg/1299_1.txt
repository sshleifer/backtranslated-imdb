This production has absolutely no action. The spectacle is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this movie to her CV. Her acting is anything but flawless and I personally believe that she has exceeded the bounds of professional decency. in terms of the way she shows herself in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong picture of the Netherlands (as in most movies). Do not bother watching this movie: waste of time, waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proven to be better when she's better on screen.
