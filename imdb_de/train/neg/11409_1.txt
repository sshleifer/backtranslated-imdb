The trend of the 80s, in which disgusting violence is masked as a "horror movie", really started. I was the target group for this repellent garbage and I was disgusted then as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start? Let's see, the setup: They can bring people back to life IF they have died a violent death. This ridiculously weak premise is the excuse to slaughter people in a cruel way, because that is necessary to bring them back to life! That could have worked, if for black laughter a la re-animator or something was played over the top. But no, it's just being played. There's a whole frightened family in a car being hunted, one of the few scenes where at least her death is out of the screen. Almost everything else is on the screen. In fact, there is a scene where a young girl is beaten and killed by zombie city dwellers who are all filming and grinning with multiple cameras. Then there is a close-up of her face, while the filmmakers lovingly and time-consumingly show in time-lapse photography how her beaten face was cut into a skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. This, of course, was done by a dormant Jack Albertson as the dying man. He likes driving in an ambulance / hearse that plays old Tommy Dorcey tunes, I think that should be cute. In the end, of course, the sheriff undead and the doctor offers friendly fix his rotting hands. It's not clear why the sheriff is not traveling with the other city dwellers, killing the kids with joy and cutting their faces, sticking needles in burning eyes, and so on. <br /> <br /> I wonder, really wonder What People See A geek show like this to rate them at all. It's not scary, the twists are ridiculous and overall it's kind of sick. It's not even good enough to "see it on a risk" or to a level where you may see a bad HG Lewis movie. It's just terrible trash, made for people who disembark with this kind of pointless gore, and made by people slumming for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Albertson was even involved.
