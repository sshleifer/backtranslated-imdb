That's what my friend Brian said after about an hour. He could not fall asleep. I had talked about how horrible it was, and eventually I relented and played it after the adjectives ran out as "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine, the pinnacle of hacking work. Something so uninspired, so unbelievably horrible, that you want to do everything after looking at it, when you sit alone in the dark and do not talk to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is on display. It is not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would recommend it ONLY to someone to understand how really unbearable it is. Do not believe me coming together. Admittedly, we as America do not always portray the peoples of the Middle East tastefully. But how about a sheikhish child banting like a salaam in front of a pile of Castrol engine oil bottles? You can find that here. GOT IT? THE ARABIC OFFER OIL. I could not believe what I saw. It would have made more sense for the child to fly planes into a skyscraper. Who would have thought it was a joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to beat the guy who was paid to write this piece in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a five-piece vocal group "Landmines" enters the stage of an officer's ball. Okay, are you ready? The joke is YOU SING TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write that in Caps? Because the joke is hit in the head with a marathon of HORRENDOUS gags. They start mediocre; Crack glasses, splinter punch glasses ... then there is, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence from A Woman's Shoes that gets along. You read that right - the music was so bad that the woman's feet were wearing shoes in a frame. In the next, the shoes are out !!! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came out! What the f ?? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless assembly of stock footage to bring home the point where the SINGING BATH is. If any man had suffered in the theater through this scene without running like hell, I would be astonished. To be honest, this movie is a joke to see how fast people would break through the doors. Robert Downey sen. Conduct the comedy the way your son demands by remaining drug-free. Bad. Other things to look out for: <br /> <br /> 1. Wherever possible, folk music was penned. Every time Liceman appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song is played. In addition, all the actors do their best to pretend it's really cool for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminal awful accent. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while she rolls a marble on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and squirm from their gaze on their cleavage, as if they were in a drama school in a community school, and they were instructed to behave like bright, retarded people , <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman is feeding a condom to his disgusting dog. Notice; When this movie came out, he accused "abortion" and "condom" was considered "edgy". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a young, hungry pedophile when Hollywood considered "pedophile" and "gay" one and the same. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the end. There is nothing wrong with your VCR. That's actually the end. Tell me you do not want to blow up anyone who has ever made a movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. Up The Academy is known for making other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, that are less fun just by placing the videotape near them.
