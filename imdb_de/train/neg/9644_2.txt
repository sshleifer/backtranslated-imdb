Everything in order . In this genre movie, the first thing you need is good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> Music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who removed a letter "A" from his spelling, did a good job, but did not do any good for such bad cast films like this one. <br/> It's used to entertaining the public, even if it's good to see, but its role in the movie is dancing. Actually, she is a dancing member of a rock band, and I do not think a rock band has dancers as a band member. <br /> <br /> In the nutshell, this film is a bit of crap. look at it, if you want to be fooled.
