That was such a waste of time. Danger: If you see it, you'll be tempted to rip your DVD out of the wall and lift it through the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: terrible, repetitive, vague dialogue; Paper thin plot line; Wooden performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hacked. <br /> <br /> Seriously faulty story, totally incredible characters. The two worst concepts in film and TV. are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> "Turn" the plot? Incredibly simple and obvious - as if one saw in the middle of the night a train on the prairie off the train. It does not even dissolve properly. The evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - do not look at it, even if it's free and you can only go to a synagogue.
