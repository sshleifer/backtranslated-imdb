I restarted the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Has the voice of Steven Seagal changed? Did he die while filming and the studio had to play the sound with someone who does not even resemble him? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes you finally hear the real voice of the actor. But in most parts of the movie, it sounds like the sound was recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill if I have a copy. I rented it, but I'll never do that again. I will review this database before lending more movies that were all (more or less) good movies. They usually knew what you got when you saw a Steven Seagal movie. I think that's no longer possible.
