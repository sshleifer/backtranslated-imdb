William Hurt Dive Scientist ??? US agents conducting the investigation abroad? The sickly contaminated man who kicked his ass after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper lacks and does not kill Hurt (only hurts him), but the second "kill" shot is dead on? Waste of time. It's ridiculous to compare it to a case like other reviewers. Oh, and at the end of the movie, they decide to wear gloves on their hands, except for the "bad" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "Virus Handshake". What? By the way ... when did IMDb need 10 lines of text? I'm just babbling here. Does not this just affect the content of reviews if you need x number of lines?
