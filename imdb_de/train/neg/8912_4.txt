Dark Rising is your typically bad, obviously fast-produced horror / science fiction / fantasy movie. It has a strange, inexplicable storyline with holes so big you could place an elephant in it. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on, but it did not really matter. It was a simple demon hunter who returned from the hell dimension to save the campers' story with confusing stuff about witches and a book of evil plots and characters that make no sense or disappear for no reason at all. Acting is bad, but honestly, they can not do much with this script. There are a few topless scenes that are probably the only reason why this bad movie was made (like so many other bad movies). Give this one pass, unless there is nothing else on TV.
