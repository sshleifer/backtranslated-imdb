I'm a Batman movie and TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as great as some people had hoped. In my opinion, it is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that there was no drama. Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm And Batman Beyond: The Joker's return had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. I also think that this movie is too bright for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, it's a good Batman movie. But I would just rent it.
