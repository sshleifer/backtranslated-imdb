This film was poorly written, badly played and very predictable. It was very cheap and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to the video. It was not even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1 1/2 hours back! The colors were awful, along with the plot, which had holes so big you could drive a Mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The act itself made the young bride do things that she was totally unable to do - what a stretch! Skip this movie and see something better in the horror genre. Almost every movie that comes to mind is better than this one. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
