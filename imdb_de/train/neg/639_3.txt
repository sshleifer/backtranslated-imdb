The stereotype of the garrison soldiers from the war is treated here boringly. Too bad that a great cast that reaches to the limit of their high talents, "The Return of the Soldier" can not solve their stiff collar inability to induce the viewer to an emotional involvement. The best moments, as noted by another reviewer, come when Glenda Jackson is on the canvas; But even Jackson's crackling film strength can not pull the chestnuts out of the cold, unheated stove. Renowned for sex kittens and accused too often of lack of acting skills, Ann-Margret finds her actual and rather profound skills wasted here, though she speaks with an almost flawless Middlesex accent. The fraudulent score, which is characterized by many lackluster sugar music motifs of many mini-series TV, is in irritating contrast to the emotional seclusion of the script, the blocking and the over-formalism of the direction. Apart from the score and the corseted script and instructions, 'The Return of the Soldier' ​​has all the right parts, but they can not work together.
