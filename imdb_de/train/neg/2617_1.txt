This movie was pure pain. I sat in the theater for x minutes, wondering when the movie would start. All settings were available. A typical love story, characters have to overcome their short gifts, bad guys have to show up, but none of them have been initiated. By the time these things happened, I was bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and agglomeration, we felt that necessary frames had been cut. Children's toys do not have to be like that. Children's films can be as captivating and captivating as adults. The apology "Hey, it's for kids," is Taurus. I will take "Sword in the Stone" every day. That was awful. I have a feeling that Disney will not be exhibiting these days. And as for the children, the 10 years I have seen this will agree ... pure garbage.
