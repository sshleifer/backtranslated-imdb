In the middle there seems to be little to Watch On the Rhine. One likes it either very much, applauding his sincerity, his liberal standpoint and his good acting, or abhors the obvious propaganda, the mediocre dialogue, the characters made of cardboard and the general tendency. I fall heavily into the latter category and found the movie and the play - as far as the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war are concerned - a breaking hole that pays off, especially for acting, and only occasionally. The author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her pieces were written for people who shared her point of view, and she rarely researched ideas that were not already held by the author and the audience, except to show how terrible the "other side" is. Even if I am one hundred percent in agreement with what she has to say, like in the Rhine, I still can not stand the way she says. Their characters are unreal, and while their ear for dialogue shows a certain way for the way people talk, it has no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I fully agree with the overdue dismantling of Hellman a few years ago with Mary McCarthy. For those who think the theater is dead or extreme and yearn for the good old days, please take a look at Watch On the Rhine, as bad as Angels In America, which only shows that the theater had a foothold sixty years ago in the grave.
