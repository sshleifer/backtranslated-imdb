Nowadays it's a kind of trend to see all shows as classics from the beginning of the 90s (people are so blinded by nostalgia these days), and although some of these shows were undoubtedly good, this show is just crap. At that time, I often watched this series because there were a lot of repeats on TV back then, and even as a kid I did not like it. Even an eight-year-old can see how much the people in Power Rangers overreact and how much the special effects sucked back then. When the show does not go back to the painfully bad "fight" scenes, she plagues the audience with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and they occasionally have little social problems. I do not know about you, but I did not talk about it to rats, and they're basically just filler until they need to "fight" a guy in a very stereotypical alien costume with fireworks or toys again-robots. You never feel "involved" with this show, and the fact that most actors behave as if they have no interest at all, except for their wallet, only adds to the lack of feeling. <br /> <br There really is nothing special about this show, and it's quite surprising that there were so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). Everything it is is just a quick way to earn some money. I challenge every "fan" to tell me what exactly is going on in episodes that are supposed to be so good because I could not find anything that even appeals to children. My guess is that most "Power Rangers" fans will tell me that I "do not understand it anyway" or anything like that. I really do not care; Back then that was crap and it's still crap.
