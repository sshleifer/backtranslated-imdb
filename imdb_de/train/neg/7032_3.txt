When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins investigating her brother's death, she suspects something more sinister than "natural causes." The closer she comes to the truth, the more threatening she becomes to her sister-in-law Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of the local Satanists. They do what is necessary to stop their curious way. <br /> <br /> If you find yourself in filthy, satanic movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is full of nudity and ritual softcore sex. You have to see a scene involving a young woman and a goat. Unfortunately, the whole shame of the world can not save black candles. Most of the movie is totally boring. Apart from the one scene that I mentioned earlier, the numerous sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Acting is spotty at best. Even the genre favorite Helga Line shows a disappointing performance. The plot does not matter. Its main function seems to be to hold together the chain of boring sex scenes. I just know another movie by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his Daughters of Darkness, who mix masterly eroticism and horror, Black Candles seems amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
