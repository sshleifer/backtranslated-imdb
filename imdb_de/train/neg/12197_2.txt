Beast Wars is a show that is hacked, overrated and overrated. Let's meet with the characters of this hideous show whose creators must have been on acid to make a show like this. Cheetor: Seriously, they need censorship bars on this guy. Why does not he sneak out that the audience has the same voice as Baby Taz? (At least razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide.) Action Blast- If you want a show series that sucks, you get G4-Tranceformers Cybertron- A Show That Should Go Into A Toilet. Good Job Creators (Sarcasm) Show it self-deferred and boring (at least the Super Mario games are better) This show had many followers to bring it back, but I think it was canceled for its own sake.
