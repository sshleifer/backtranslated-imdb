Ho-hum. The deadly bioweapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) runs the risk of falling into the wrong hands. Unconsciously, his son (Luke Perry) has been working on the antidote all along. Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the chases for cats and mice, and the fire begins The cast also features Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems hopelessly moving through this mess, definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.
