I hated this show when I was a kid. That was when the children's characters were actually accents, not just the usual generic American dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf was south. Like one of the others, I never quite understood what the witch who wants the flute was. That always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I would not have bothered to take it away! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to the early McDonalds commercials of the early '70s that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf demolished McDonalds. At the peak of McDonald's popularity, the TV show (or rather, its creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show. However, when McDonalds refused, the TV show easily changed the characters and handed them over as their own. They even hired former employees of the McDonalds advertising agency and spokespeople for the TV shows. McDonalds complained and won. Look for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you will find many articles about it.
