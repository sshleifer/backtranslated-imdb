SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe this movie was maybe cool in 1987 ... if you've never seen a * good * ninja movie before. Cheesy music of the 80s ... cheesy dialogues ... cheesy acting ... and much more than cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is in the beginning ... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... several black-clad ninjas are trying to sneak up on him and it looks like he's too eager to close his ball Suddenly he grabs his golf bag and ... well, I will not spoil it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about a stolen videotape or something. A bunch of dim bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the way of ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something similar. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight any better after their training than before ... well, the movie moves quite vividly. The fight scenes may not be great, but they are abundant ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for a few giggles.
