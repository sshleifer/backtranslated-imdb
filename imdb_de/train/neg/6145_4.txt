Although I had seen "Gymkata" in a theatrical manner as early as 1985, I could not remember anything about the plot except for vague pictures of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls, and disappointment at the end. > <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I took a copy of the newly released DVD to immerse myself in the world of Gymkata. In the 80s, this would go straight to the video today. Film stars gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of "Parmistan" and win "The Game," a suicidal blood sport sponsored by the Khan that encourages its people to call as it sounds "Yak Power." The mission's goal is the defense system of Star Wars. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts of Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained, he tries to mix with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white lines. Needless to say, Cabot races and fights on the stony streets of Parmistan on his way to a date with fate and the game of his life. <br/> <br /> Star Thomas Kurt was badly served by director Robert Clouse, who looks like this, has never been on set. The so-called script is just this page of incompetence. See other reviews for the many howlers everywhere. The City of Mads has some good moments, but is eventually ruined by bad editing. The end ... meh. Nevertheless, there is the germ of a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good.
