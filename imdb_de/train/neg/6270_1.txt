Somehow, a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls in the mouth of people who supposedly change their personality, but in reality they turn into mad, zombie-like killers. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are scant-clad, young women who urgently need acting classes. This movie is horrible, cruel and surprisingly bad. It has little to no logic in the script. You will really have trouble following what is going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen, which supposedly represents a major scientific advance, looks nothing more than an old Atari screen. What's worse, there's a puppet with felt tresses (like a lonely boy in a summer camp), called George, who's like a personal servant / confidante of Jessica (the lead actress). Throughout the film you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterances of this puppet. But wait ... you also get lots of softcore, unexotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. Meanwhile, a very annoying soundtrack in the background plays a kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors is good. There are only different degrees of bad. The aspects "Gore" and "Horror" are filmed particularly inappropriately. The movie really looks like a teenager who put it together. It is no coincidence that Henry Sala, the name of the director, but not by profession, has not made another film. I almost got bored in a coma watching this stupid, stupid filth! And what's the end? What happened? If you know, let me in the secret, because I can not understand it for my life. All I know is that I lost the time I spent watching this garbage make the weekend of my weekend a nightmare.
