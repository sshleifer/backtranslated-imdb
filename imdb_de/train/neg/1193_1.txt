Do you know how you can sometimes see a crappy movie with friends and laugh about the shortcomings of the movie? Well, that was beyond. I bought the DVD from Tower Records because it was about $ 3.00, and I had heard that this was a movie to laugh about. It is really nothing less than pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends asked me to turn off the movie. At 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we made a compromise to rewind to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It is more than painful.
