SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had less potential. In fact, the under-explored title phenomenon is intriguing, and for at least the first half, this attempt by Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in a way that only gaudy horror of the 90s can offer. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-off-off-again performance and overly complicated conspiracy, this potential thriller loses his way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, who was introduced here before his built-in horror fan base has accumulated, is average guy Sam. Of course, average men in horror movies do not stay a long time on average, so after a successful lineage survey, we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he also lights other people, much to the dismay of Gal buddy Lisa, who was unimaginably played by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the film implies a spirited monster, director Hooper Sam decided to make an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film additional human depth that he otherwise lacks, but it also prevents us from truly fearing the Human Flamethrower. We have to wonder if this would have been better as a straightforward villain than at all, at NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS BURNING is a fairly nominal effort when all is said and done. It will find additional appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can not get enough horror of the 1990s, be it good, bad or in between, but only on a slow night.
