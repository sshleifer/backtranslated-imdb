I expected this to get a lot better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was very excited to see these online short films. Well, they were not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what I really do not like. I think they are kind of boring. The sound bothers me and most of the characters, though I loved Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode annoyed me the most, though it was pretty funny <br /> I do not like the way some characters die. For example, how Match Girl set fire to the gas station or how Girl Who Stares generally died. Roy's death was surprisingly amusing. Death by a car air freshener. Very original ;-) That made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just a little speech and Gore. That's all I have to say! 3.10
