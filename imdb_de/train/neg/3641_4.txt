Summary: Legend has it that the Valkyrie defied Brunhilda Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a warrior, pure in heart, can go through the flames, free Brunhilda, free her from Odin's claim and keep her to herself. Now war is spreading in the Nordic countries, and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors challenged by Odin's national animals, who demand war, blood, and flesh, and are therefore outcasts, but superior in battle. The leader of the Berserker is a despised son of King Eber, and his prize for the Alliance is his brother, the future King Barek. But after the king is victorious in battle, he refuses to give up his only remaining son, breaks his oath to Eber and betrays him and kills him. Boar is saved only by Barek's call against Odin. However, this is just the beginning of the fight between the brothers, and the final battle is about to begin now, a millennium later ... <br /> <br /> Comment: I had the hope that this would be a movie based on it Viking grounds, there was far too little quality film shot about Viking. It also started very well with detailed longships and armor, beautiful and matching landscapes and an OK fight. <br /> <br /> The basis in the myths of Aesir is thin and seems to me to be very corrupt. Odin is much more vindictive, vicious, and absent than I remind him of the school, and the Valkyries became vampire demons. I'm not an expert, but that seems completely wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal flaw of this movie is to move the time setting from the original date range to today. If the two brothers had fought with some decent battles in time, this movie would have been much better. Now the attitude is suddenly changed to today's Stockholm. Nevertheless, Odin is present and sends Boar and his berserkers for Brunhilda and Barek, resulting in stupid scenes as armored and painted berserkers wage swordfights with Barek between industries. Beautiful mountains and forests were exchanged for cement. And when I was allowed to focus on individual fights instead of massive fights as in the beginning, I quickly realized that the fights and abilities of the actors are slow and awkward. <br /> <br /> The end result is sometimes a thin story difficult to follow and sometimes just stupid, and the only thing that could save it is the action that comes from slow, boring and awkward swordfights. It refers very little to the myth of Aesir or the Viking tradition. So both the story and the action fail and the movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> As a Swede, this movie is a bit confusing. Allegedly completely shot in South Africa, it still contains some well-known Swedish signs, license plates and a seemingly authentic police car. However, the effort is small and only goes so far that it is really set in Sweden. No names are Swedish (maybe with the exception of Anya), no known landscapes are Swedish, they speak (allegedly) a bit (old?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And both police and medical uniforms are clearly not Swedish. If they did not even try to get it right - and really make the illusion that it's in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
