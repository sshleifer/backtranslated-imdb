This movie is not interesting until the first ten minutes. Tempo and cut are a perfect introduction to an ensemble piece, even better than Gosford Park. Then, inexplicably, it slows down, loses focus and resembles a traditional French film, finally regaining focus with the love affair between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several started threads are not finished. <br /> **** / * ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. After his relationship with her, he was faithful to her many years ago, even though she had remarried and settled in Morocco. As a master builder, he now builds his own life and recovers through the mask of Cecile's marriage. After he has done this, he is buried (literally) after an unusual accident and becomes a coma. He awakens only after she has burned her old image, as an indication that they have reconciled with the past and can start their lives right again. ******* END OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> It remains unclear what vision this director wants to see us, because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there is regular radio Broadcasts about the overthrow of the former Iraqi regime. Céciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) when he meets his friend while the girl he lives with seems to be ill (of it?). Her sister is traditionally Islamic and has a relationship with Céciles husband. It presents Morocco as unnecessarily backward, despite all the buildings there is a strange colonial vision that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and vulnerable to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but generally not. In the end, everything can best be described as adding Couleur locale and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. They are so familiar with this material that they can create something special in every scene: raise eyebrows, body language, radiant pride, awkward behavior. The film itself is disappointing and confirms only the limited role of French cinema in today's world. Of course, with some notable exceptions.
