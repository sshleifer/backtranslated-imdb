THE TEMP (1993) did not have much to do with theater, but here's the direct video rip-off that you did not want anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new wife of Millennium Investments, a major brokerage firm that gets helpful tips from Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious girl of the father, which will do nothing to push the career ladder up, including a top broker she does not like, and murdered anyone who is on their bad side. She digs skeletons into Ellen's wardrobe, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while appearing responsible, kidnaps her daughter, and tries to get her to embezzle money from the company. > Harris and Kelley provide competent services, the supporting cast is fine and well-organized, but a script that does a well-trodden track and has few surprises can not fully compensate for that.
