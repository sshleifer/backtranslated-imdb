I'm very tolerant of really bad sci / fi- and horror movies - I've watched them since I was 4 or 5 years old, so I've seen really bad stuff, but I'll take care of that. I have even seen many sci-fi channel films, so I do not have to expect much - a normally promising movie that has no end. I think the hope is eternal, or the victory of hope over the experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the start, and I knew it, but like a moth in the flame I always thought of something, anything interesting would happen. It does not All actors do a decent job - given the script, I do not know how they all remained sincere. It has something to do with collagen-starved worm parasite creatures that are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. There is a vicious plastic surgeon who works with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of people ... do not worry, he'll get what comes to him. The Slug people themselves do not really know where they came from, they think they made a ride on a meteor that landed on Earth, but ... somehow they know about the members of the Slug kings - the Slug Princess managed to breed with a human who knows she is the worm queen and loves her for herself ... oh, do I have to go on? Please, I implore you, do not waste two hours of your life observing this ... everything would be better ... think of the worst, least pleasant way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this.
