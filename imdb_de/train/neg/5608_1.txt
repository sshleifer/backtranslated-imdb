I was curious to see this movie. Many people seem to be upset. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of views and opinions. For me, it does not matter if Jesus exists as it is in the Bible. Whether Mary was virgin or not or all similar pagan coincidences. What is important to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What angered me is when someone punishes being portrayed as fact without showing the context, it was written. For example, in this film they showed the following great phrase: "My enemies who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What they did not say I say You, is the context. Jesus told a story of a wicked king. There is no place in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After misquoting the Bible, they present to us screaming people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hate. The majority of viewers do not check the information so they start to think of Jesus = hate = not good for me or for other people. These are pure manipulation people. Please use your brain. Do not assume anything as a fact that you are telling in this movie. We are destroying our own base, our civilization, by dismantling Jesus in this way and the message he has brought us. You sawn off the branch on which you are sitting.
