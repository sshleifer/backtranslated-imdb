OK, the movie is good, but I give it a 1, because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is sheer fairy tale. This kind of crap only adds to this unpredictable madman that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First and foremost, code strands and dozens of 1 and 0 add up to computer viruses. An organic virus is much more complex, though it is much smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic viruses build into your cells and bind to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain how this could be handled by a monitor? Maybe the radiation has an effect on the user's cornea, which turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see that, but obviously the writer did not think so.
