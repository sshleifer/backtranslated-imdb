Although Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to anyone, although it is especially popular with Knappertsbusch, 1951. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly swells, Syberberg keeps the cast at the same pace. The settings for Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to the film editing? The result is physically exhausting. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Her impulse is to go home quickly and play a recording to confirm that Wagner did it right, Syberberg misunderstood it. And this embellishment with these "smart" memories of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a spectator of this film without Wagner knowledge?
