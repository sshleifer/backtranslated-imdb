Man, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly, where do I get them? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, transforming herself into a werewolf. And that's not a Rick Baker 'American werewolf' transformation, folks. We are talking about the worst make-up that has ever been filmed here. I can only imagine that a stony Italian glue on the naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagonist of the film (is that a word?)) Spreads and she asks to furrow. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> It does not get much better from here. Minutes are wasted as the scenery in which male actors are chewed swirls about Daniela and her state or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad, if you do not laugh about it, you'll cry) The funny It's because Daniela is not even a werewolf. She is a psycho who always comes to mind when a man is around (understandable when she was raped as a child) opening scene). She can not help ripping out the throat of every man she meets, and she just wants to be loved! It's starting to look for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a bumbling stuntman who does not trigger her "episodes." Check out the montage here, one of the cheesiest you've ever seen (laughing and hugging after you've dived headfirst through a window). Daniela's luck does not last, as the movie takes a brutal turn, Suddenly, she is viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Daniela recalls "I spit on your grave" and robs her rapists of bloody revenge. <br /> <br /> These are 100 minutes of my life that I will never get back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a movie freak.
