At the end of "Dragon Heat" I could only remember why I took the trouble to endure the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is interesting and that attracted me as well as Maggie Q to the movie in the first place. Was I ever disappointed? Author and director Daniel Lee can not hold a candle to John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I'm incredibly relaxed about this one - that he fills the movie with completely unnecessary black-and-white stills, stills, slow motion, time-lapse, and other visual nonsense. I suspect he has done everything to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and are more like a hopped music video than anything else. The characters do not need to be interested - including two supposedly professional snipers who could not hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - which are then loaded with some of the kasest dialogues that I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is free of twists and turns - from the first set up, all predictable fashion unfolds - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding ourselves of the characters' backstays, just in case we did not have it several times the first time. This is terribly amateur writing and filmmaking and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although I'm honest, I can barely remember that Biehn was in a good movie that was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great Hong Kong action-maker, you're way better off sticking to some staple foods - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992), Ringo Lam's "City on Fire" (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his remake "Point Blank" (1967), "Full Contact" (1992). Or watch Yuen's "So Close" (2002), a very entertaining yet absurd popcorn movie. And there is always the great French police man "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> It's true that most, if not all, are a bit over the top, but they were films that stay exciting. exciting and even exciting. They have characters that are important to us and breathtaking action sequences. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad action movie, but a boring one.
