DO NOT WATCH THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A FILM. I wasted time and money on it and I'm pretty angry. <br /> <br /> Acting is similar to high school games. The script is shocking. There is no action. Twenty minutes before the end (which I think I should be rewarded for), I had a headache from all the screaming, weeping and wailing of the five girls. The majority of violence is (rather seldom for a movie (nowadays) suggested rather than graphically presented, but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and in fact every single person involved in the production of this piece had the terrible way dies. <br /> <br /> I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from the very bad 100 minutes. Do not do it.
