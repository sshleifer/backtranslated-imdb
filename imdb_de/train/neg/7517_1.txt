*** One in ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it did, it will get a F. Holy Mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave him every reasonable accommodation, considering it was a video, but it failed me on every occasion. As with many other B films, the basic plot was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have adequate resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It's a shame that they linked this fiasco with the good name Halloween. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags that host their annual Halloween haunted house fundraiser, when out of nowhere a satanic spellbook appears hurling the lads to hell. Well, that's the idea anyway, but instead, the movie is largely devoted to depicting the relationship escapades of this frat boy, who are richly endowed with a hideous lesbian subplot. Very little of the actual story is dedicated to Halloween or the mysterious magic book. It really makes me angry that the filmmakers thought they could get away with such a dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially about the relationship between boys and boys. This is NOT what the movie is calculated for. I'm tempted to track down the producers and at least threaten them with bodily harm. The drama is as bad as it gets, it's cruel! The script is unintentionally funny. The cinematography is just lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. Through this movie, the SyFy Channel movie productions look like masterpieces. The last half hour of the movie felt like the filmmakers realized that they did not produce soap operas, and somehow had to interfere with horror sequences. The book of the evil Banne finally comes into play and makes everyone in the haunted house the figure who presents itself as disguised. I almost feel like crying when I write this review. Impressive! I mean wow! This thing was an incorruptible catastrophe.
