This has been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. I did not know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where should one start? The filming of the film was absent-minded and boring. At one point there is a one-minute scene in which nobody talks, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, incredible dialogues and basically no conspiracy. If you rent this movie, look at it with some friends and it could be a good comedy. Otherwise, if you see this movie, run it.
