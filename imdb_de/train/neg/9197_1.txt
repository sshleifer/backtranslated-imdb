There are a few films that you know are getting sick of image one. Even if you were not aware of Ed Wood's work, take a look at this commentator from "Plan 9 from the space" and you know you will not see the next movie masterpiece. When I saw the first shot of Uwe Boll's masterpiece "House of Dead," with this man sitting at the front of the house, beginning his introduction while desperately trying to sound as if he had just arrived from Sin City, I knew that I'm in a hellish ride. <br /> <br /> This is how the movie starts - first, the main character says that everyone else is going to die. You know you are moving on. Then he starts to introduce the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... means she's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia ... my ex ... We broke up recently ... I had to learn and she had to fight" , No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this group of 20-year-olds who can not figure out a wet paper bag goes to the "Rave of the Century", swarming. These are a couple of tents, a small harbor and a modest stage on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but they'll be grateful to find a way to get there, a fishing boat that's a genius from Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get a? Man, who wrote this script) and his buddy, the one Bastard is the son of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and this hookler who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To make the long story short, the gang come to the island and find out there except a few bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No, do not wait, they will all be happy and like cos there is free liquor. With this scene, the film hits the low point and is unlikely to go downhill. Some people in rubber suits are running around, shouting and shooting, our gang goes into a house to meet another gang, they go out, meet Cpt Kirk and a policewoman (who has about 500 pounds of guns) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they turn into a S.W.A.T. Team, enter the matrix, the guys in the rubber suit begin to multiply like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid for it. To further offend the injury, there are shots every few minutes from the video game this crap is based on, and there's a cute game-over scene for a few characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit in the famous category "It's so bad". It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there are no tensions, lines are bad, actors are bad. The list just goes on. <br /> <br /> You'll probably only want to see this movie because of its movie reputation to be terrible. Not There are bad movies that deserve to be seen. This is not one of them.
