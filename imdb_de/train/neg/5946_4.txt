There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no high point ... nothing. But has some good fight scenes that are actually pretty good. So let's go ... overall, the movie is pretty bad, but if you like a mindless movie that only has good action scenes, then watch this movie. Good acting and not a bad direction ... A couple of cameos by Kimbo and Carano ... I saw Carano a little bit more in this movie ... She's a good fighter and a really hot one Girl ... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future, so we can really enjoy his art. Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... that would be fantastic
