Boring, cheap science-fiction thriller made with almost total conviction (a control room with computers and other devices used to receive and decode messages from space is operated by ONLY ONE MAN and is VERY poorly guarded at night ) and full of noisy sound effects. Not only is Christopher Lee wasted, he also gives one of his few "I'm here for the money" credits. (* 1/2)
