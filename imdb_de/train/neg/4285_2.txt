If you want to see a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Story of Bruce Lee <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision "is a horrible movie. Terrible production values. Terrible spectacle Terrible script. I would not recommend that this movie be viewed by anyone who seriously thinks that Tripe is like this high quality entertainment or promotes the awareness of Asian Americans in Hollywood (this movie does not either) say that this one Movie on a rainy day is a passable conversation when you meet him while surfing the canals. If you're curious, maybe a Netflix rental, but this movie is definitely not for you. <br /> <br /> If you're one of the few who have seen this movie as a means of getting your Asian movie known and disappointed, then I recommend the following movies for your personal viewing. These are well-written high-output films that feature a talented cast of Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
