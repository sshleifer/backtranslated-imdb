This is by far one of the most boring and dreadful reports on the beginnings of Adolf Hitler that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but acting as Hitler is simply wrong. To name Liev Schrieber as Hitler's longtime friend and helper, Haefengstal from the Simon Wiesenthal Center must have been desperate and desperate. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, bad bad casting. This was not a happy family movie with a good historical background. This was Hollywood trash at its finest, won by the strength of a strong (but painfully under-burdened) cast of actors who had almost disappeared from radar in the last five years. <br /> <br /> The fake German accents (vee vill vin zis var) insult the German people everywhere. My mother is German and she sat in front of the sound of the voices, which always changed in the same sentence of American / English / German. The supporting cast makes better cardboard cutouts in the local video library than on the screen. Jenna Malone as Geli Raubal, the lover, was great, but she seized the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ended her own life to escape from what her future would have been like in Hitler's shadow If you have an incredibly fantastic and historically accurate To get a report on Hitler's early years before the war / holocaust, hire "Inside the Third Reich" (1983) with Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and more meaningful than this nonsense. <br /> <br /> As a historian of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that I wanted to grab my books to confirm his myriad of inaccuracies.
