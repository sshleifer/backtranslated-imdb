My husband and I watched this movie because we are the horror movies that we are. Two hours later, I wanted my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film essentially contained the best points of the film. The movie was not very scary, except a good timing for surprise entrances etc. I found most of the "scary" parts weirder than anything else. After watching other films based on the works of Japanese authors, I find that what is scary in Japan is not what is scary here in the US. My tip: If you're a fan of true horror movies, you should avoid the pain of watching this movie. I can not really say that I would also recommend renting it, unless you have a free rental agreement.
