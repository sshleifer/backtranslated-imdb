Walk around a lot. A poorly designed opponent with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications, sends signals into space, and receives them is struck by strangers. Together with his pretty wife he invades her territory and gets secrets about her. He gets pretty treacherous. Granted, he has little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long stretches on which little happens. The plot is technically not bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a drive through a forest, a building. That's what editing is about. I suppose the story would not support much more technically. Not much here.
