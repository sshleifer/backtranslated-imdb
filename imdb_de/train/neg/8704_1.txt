In general, I like dinosaur movies, but this is sheer crap. No script, no dialogue, no acting. And the brave Colonel Rance, who tries to show that he is tough, and his crooked mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So that was a complete waste of time (luckily not a waste of money when watching the movie on TV). And I really can not understand that 7 people who completed this exam understand 10. You must have joked. My advice, if you see this title, run away!
