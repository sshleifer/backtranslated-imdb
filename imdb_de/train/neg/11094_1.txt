This movie is another on my list of films that do not deal with it. I saw it 40 years ago as a teenager, stayed late and was very upset that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history, if that was so. It's what I call a bait and a movie change, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is an issue that deserves a good cinematic treatment. This movie is almost an insult to those who have served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were neither on the run from the law nor as a result of abusive houses. They were really idealists who wanted to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a higher class than Tab Hunter's character. The flying school is not for the smartass and the knowledge of everything, an individual like the one pictured here would not have taken two days, it would have been either the palisade or the infantry. The discipline in the French army was often quite intense. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
