I picked up this movie in the hope that it looks like the funny "The Gamers" from Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary style that became famous by the office, but it does not deliver. The reason is partly the stiff acting, but mostly the writing and governing. Of course, it can be weird to use every single clich√© about RPGs, but here it is made to be extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of every scene you know what the "joke" is about. But the biggest problem may be that everything is presented above. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there were subtitles like "LAUGHT NOW" or a cheap 80's fake laugh track, it would not make much difference. For some scenes, you can not help but say, "Yes, I understand why they thought this would be funny," but the way it is performed takes all sorts of fun out of the possible joke.
