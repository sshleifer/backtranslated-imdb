Images that normally glorify a hero are meaningful. For example, Bonnie and Clyde have glorified the dynamic bank robbers and, in spite of their evil deeds, they actually felt compassion for them. Why? There were two people trapped in depression when people desperately wanted to survive. <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. Why? He races across a street in Idaho on his way to the hospital where his affected wife has gone. No one bothers why he tries to escape everyone. Worse still, if the realization becomes obvious that he is not a terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him while trying to save their back-forces Radio-Emcee, who is building up to support our hero on the story. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely incredible.
