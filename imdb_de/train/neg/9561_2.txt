As many others have commented here before me, I have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst I've ever seen. There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because I hate Corruptors. <br /> <br /> I felt I was watching an episode of a TV show or something like that, where they had a hold on some of the extra money I could spend on CGI (which I've experienced worse). All in all, it is an insult to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge of computer and / or technology. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel good, and I just had to beg for everything to end quickly. In addition, there are countless "easy-out-out" scenarios that also insult your intelligence as a thinking person ... <br /> <br /> This film absolutely fades compared to the old "wargames". and I think it's too bad they even called it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, just for one thing and one thing only: The actors' performances are not bad, they are the irritated crap of a script they had to work with. Nevertheless, they should never have signed up for this film. Not really a career move, but I think we have to pay all the bills. <br /> <br /> For those of you who rated this movie with the highest score ... you have to be on the salary list of the studio or so my only explanation. <br /> <br /> For those who have not seen them yet, be sure to pay attention and decide. But lower your expectations on the ground (and then some).
