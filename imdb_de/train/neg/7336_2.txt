This is a very mild and lazy production of one of Shakespeare's liveliest pieces. I can only assume that the intention was to make the piece as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that Shakespeare had not previously introduced. In this way, however, by making every line clear and making every intention obvious, they have exhausted the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature. It's actually boring somehow - a very hard performance given such a wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The acting is memorable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others are not doing so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a pouting, breathless airborne head that often shakes. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash (though Snidley was much more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) is not included in this version unless he was disguised and basically had his name removed from the credits Theater god, this production is not only disappointing, but also scratchy. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it. Instead, look at Branagh's Much Ado - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful performances.
