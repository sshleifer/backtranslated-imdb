The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his affair with the Amelia Earhart-like character played by Katherine Hepburn. By the time they met, he had been a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but mesmerizing Hepburn, "he could not help himself," and they fell in love. You notice it because you look a lot into outer space and talk about how painful your unfulfilled love is. Honestly, this is a terribly old-fashioned and practically impossible movie. Part of the problem is that in the pre-code days, movies that made adultery shine were very common. And even if you accept this morally suspicious theme, it sounds like a nineteenth-century novel ... and really bad, because of the complete sappiness of dialogue. Sticky and with hard-to-love characters (after all, Clive's wife is a nice woman and has not done any harm to anyone), making her a huge waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume that Hepburn wears in an early scene dressed in a moth costume! You have to see it to believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (an obscure, but fitting reference).
