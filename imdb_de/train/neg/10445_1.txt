This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script is pathetic and the biggest question is how did this pretty low bracketing script come through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from deep dramas to more masculine-oriented ones, killing everything you see, kind of movie, so I can not say I'm picky. I was struggling to find something to compare, but I can not think of anything that suits it, maybe Starship soldiers. 2. The Witch makes the movie gods cry and I think about throwing out my DVD player By comparison, its effects are great. The drama and the script should be honored. You know, if a movie is fun in a funny way, well, people, that's not one of those who kill your soul minute by minute.
