The movie was most likely made in 1930 and released in 1931. I would guess that talking to moving pictures was very difficult to make the transition from the silent film era. Nevertheless, this particular Zane-Gray plot seems to be very weak. Even Gary Cooper probably just learned to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. Maybe for 1931. Not acceptable for 2004. Some actors have shown good performances. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They lived in the countryside long before the white man came, but according to the twisted story, they had no right to defend themselves.
