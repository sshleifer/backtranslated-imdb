This was just a horrible movie. It hurt to see it. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the drama was really bad (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says anything about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some connections to Carlito's way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the Caribbean, but on the whole they were weak. The love interest was in my opinion completely wrong, but that is questionable. Anyway, I really did not expect much before watching the movie, and I think you could even say that those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's actually a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky, because I'm sure that not too many people will see this movie. I generally give films a decent rating if they even arouse my interest, so I'll go on and give this movie two stars. Good luck next time. And yes, I enjoyed Carlito's way.
