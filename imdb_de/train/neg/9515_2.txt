OK, I looked at the French original version. But I can not imagine that this is better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that this is the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities for this film. That's why I can not understand the positive reviews. It may be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are best left unfathomable. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow films as long as they serve the purpose of the film. Tarkovsky Solaris is extremely slow, but allows the self-observation and, for example, the mood of the film again. In this case, however, the film is filed with a thoughtless dialogue that can tell us something about the characters. Nothing that I could identify with or care about. In many scenes, I thought, "When will you shut up"? The acting was pretty bad. Not in an obvious way. It does not seem, however, that none of the actors were interested in their characters, and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue they have received. The whole movie felt pretty mechanical as well. Go from one scene to the next. It seems that the film was written only (badly), but never directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I can say has not caused any of the scenes to have an emotional reaction. No tension, no fear, no anticipation, no grief, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest, whatever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of an anti-film.
