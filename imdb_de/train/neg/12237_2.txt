Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty Cartoon: Requires a little work, but could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the fourth of July? Come on! Give me a break!!! This was a movie that should not have been done. It was bad. It was not a public holiday, except on the 4th of July. That made it particularly bad, since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And every movie can be ruined by singing too much. The frequent songs made this movie appear much longer than it really was. The film attempts to mix two well-known Chirstmastime characters with a traditional American holiday (which seems to "limit" it almost to America), to many meaningless songs and a lousy plot. The result? A bad movie that can not really be seen at any time of the year. I would suggest that you do without this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
