I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was appalled by the graphic, sado-masochistic child pornography that I experienced. The plot is hidden behind too many graphic sex scenes - and not one is in the least erotic - the feeling is sick. The director seemed more in favor of shock than exploring the different levels of why these characters are. See it, if you can stand it - I still have flashbacks.
