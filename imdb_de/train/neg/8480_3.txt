I can not say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. But on the other hand, I can not say that it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's basically a girl who skates, is good at it, wants to go to an expensive school, can not afford it and has to do a hockey scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress Katelin plays. She absolutely could not cry to save her life, just made lamentations, like a toddler pretending to cry to find her own way. <br /> <br/> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to be all nice and helpful. Also, the part where the two skaters call their names and say something about their choreographer, and she says she "pulls the line," made me flinch. <br /> <br /> We all knew where it would go with her and Spencer. Classically they did not like each other and in the end it was somehow typical to get together. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this is a movie that you can watch when you like skating, but if you do not mind, the main hangover is very annoying. It's good to basically kill time.
