The first one was the best. The second was bad because the dialogue was terrible. Although the story was not so bad (in fact, all stories are good and bad). During the entire movie, I've diminished a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (but that's based on her screenplay). All characters were not so good. But some of the things I like about Rush Hour 2 are always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan does not do those things, which is good for him.
