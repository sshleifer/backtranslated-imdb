Lately, they've been trying to film this movie in cable television commercials late at night. Do not believe the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people who saw this stinker in the cinemas. This is, in my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, right behind Mac & Me (# 1 Worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I have to admit, they are all close and all terrible! Really, none of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else that is said to be no money. The only thing it is good for is to give to your worst enemy. I do not lie about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a good candidate for this film. It's so terrible. If you do not believe me, then you deserve to suffer the misery if you observe this. I doubt you can handle it. Two thumbs excited.
