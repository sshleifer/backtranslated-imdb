You will recognize the action immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to reunite mom and dad. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here is the scary thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills when she played the role of the crazy daughter, Durbin looks much older than adulthood. And so are all her so-called siblings. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes through the movie. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor suits, but they look ridiculous as the director struggles to point out their wide tops and jerseys during the movie. So you are constantly torn when you look at them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start beating them, they feel like they're pedophiles, and you might also be one who has noticed those toushies and tops that the director has pointed out. Whether teenagers or crazy, little girls or little foxes, you're never quite sure what to make of it. <br /> <br /> Even the parents look very old and the whole movie looks very outdated <br/> <br /> It's a rusty version of the parent trap that you should avoid or at least make sure yours is Tetanus shots are up to date if you do not believe me.
