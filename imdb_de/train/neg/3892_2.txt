Would you like to see a scary horror movie? Then avoid this. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But there is enough scotch. Single malt, if you can do it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments were not enough to watch the movie sober, let me help you. NASA sends a man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A huge solar flare makes Colonel Steve West bleed out of his nose. From there it goes downhill, and it comes to Wackiness. <br /> <br /> I actually read the book adaptation, which was only published and published in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was terrible. At least something is faked, and from the author a kind of explanation of the events is drawn (rhymes with "gas"). <br /> <br /> Not to say that the movie is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really should read a contract before signing up for a movie, and Jonathan Demme found he was actually better suited to direct it, of course, it's pretty much edited. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of Scotch can save you. <br /> <br /> Please check out Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. Watch Space Cowboys if you need to see astronauts. I can not recommend this film to the sober audience with a clear conscience.
