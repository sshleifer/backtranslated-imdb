John candy. Do we have to say more? He is the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not know how gifted he was as an actor. Experience how he changes from a poor bitch to a horny wanker. Just a simple (subtle) face change and off you go. There are many great parts in this movie and lots of really stupid parts. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes and the great moment when John (in a trance) takes to the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure if you read that, you might think that this sequence sounds really crude. It is, but it is also very funny, especially because John Candy does this piece. The story is generally rather lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candy) do not have enough to do in the movie. Levy has his moments, above all, he films the wedding at the end (think of Rod Serling) and the great scene when he talks to his mother on the phone. All in all, a good movie, if you had a busy day and you have to put your brain on stupid. I give this 4 out of 10 points.
