Okay, now I know there are millions of Americans who believe in the Rapture. This moment when all the people who are born again in Christ will be caught up to meet God, and the rest of humanity will remain on the earth to die in plagues and fire and the heartache of psoriasis, while the Antichrist will fought with Jesus (in an uncharacteristically warlike way). And I know that the books were bestsellers. , At least among believers. And I do not disrespect all this. <br /> <br /> But I have to say, they stuffed this movie into a sack and hit it with the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The action does not need to be readjusted. If you saw this movie, you probably read the book. I am perhaps one of the few people on earth who saw this only because of the terrible experience of evil and I was not disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little Gremlin "Growing Pains," who came of age on this show, found Christ and decided that SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you can spread the word of God in movies so that they never make it to theatrical release. Well, that's not necessarily true: I think this was the only movie ever produced on DVD FIRST with a voucher for a free tour of the movie when it was released in theaters. I still have the coupon! How many people did you think appeared? I do not know about you, but it never came to my city. Of course, I live in New York, where we sit godless liberals and tear pages from the bible to make joints. Here you go. In fact, I bet three million people on Manhattan Island that none of them would be delighted. <br /> <br /> Check out the complementary materials on the DVD, where you'll learn the scary details behind the scenes of these films. , CAST and CREW must all have the same religious mindset. They do not come straight out and say that, but listen carefully to what the filmmakers say. It's like a bunch of pod people shooting a pod movie. How crawling is that? Honestly, this stuff preaches only to the converts, right? Can you imagine that someone who does NOT subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing observes this, beats his forehead, and says, "HOLY HOOVER DAM, I'd better be saved PRONTO!" Anyway, I'm addicted. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially the one with Gary Busey, whom I consider TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse for attending. He cracked his head on some paving as he crashed his motorcycle. Oy. Oh, and something else. What about all the shots of poor, innocent dogs whimpering and their leashes uselessly dragging the ground because their owners were called to heaven? What about it? Should we feel bad for the dogs, and if so, what do we do with God? Is not it IRK people that there is no room in heaven for man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason why I am agnostic. Good night and good luck.
