I had never seen a Tarzan movie before. When I saw him on TV, I thought I would try. I have to say unfortunately, I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and a bit overweight. Not, as I had imagined, that Tarzan would look like. And if I did not miss it while making myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional whistle. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - hopping from vine to vine. Alright, so much for the expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy with a guitar. There were rogues and good men and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but nothing good either. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
