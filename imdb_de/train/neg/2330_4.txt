I loved how it started, with some pretty special effects especially for a 50 year old movie. There was a pretty impressive landscape. However, the film came down pretty early with some very stupid dialogues as the men all tried to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius" It was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has been making television programs since this film was released ... and still playing. It was also interesting to see a young-looking Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams") whom I would not have recognized if that voice had not been. I've seen half of this movie before boredom was almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated that they converted this VHS tape to stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overrated films in which "elites" think so "heavy" and "thought-provoking". This is nonsense. It just appeared "smart" because the rest of the '50s sci-fi movies were so stupid timing of this writing. Maybe another look - this time on the widescreen transmission at 2.35: 1 I would change this review.
