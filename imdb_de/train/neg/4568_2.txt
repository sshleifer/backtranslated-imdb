Not a bad start for the program - but what a real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it tries to call itself a reality - and is anything but. Men and women who devote their lives to enforcing laws deserve better than that. What's next, medical school in a minute? Charo performs Lipo? Charles Grodin on a hip replacement? Come on ... show a little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie make the program in scene. Police Academy = Gymnasium? Bad editing (how often can you use the auto-to-auto recording of the Taco Bell in the background?), Kitschy siren effects (the same loop added to every "call" (scrolling code or not) adnauseum and last but not least - more safety concerns of the officers than you could shake off a stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see established cops and wily butt-caught cops, I would see RENO 911.
