I basically skimmed the movie, but just enough to see what the story was about. To be honest, it was boring for me and in some places it made no sense. The only reason I ever saw this movie was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He's so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot. <br /> <br /> Despite the hot CHACE, it did not make up for the movie. I guess the plot is not that bad, but what really impressed me was the fact that they scold like every sentence. Is it so difficult to express your anger without saying the word F every time? The nonsense was annoying and the whole eye-catching thing moving with the camera made me headache I found the movie boring and dramatic. That's why I only cut scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyway, it's not worth renting unless it's your die-hard fan of a certain actor like me. Oh yes, the cast was hot. The girls were hot !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
