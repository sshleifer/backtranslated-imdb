I saw this movie some time ago (when I was working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins talks on the phone (but he still lets Hewitt down in their scenes) and Alec looks bored. Believe me, you should avoid this movie like the plague if it's ever published. It seems to take forever, while the tired action takes place at a snail's pace. It is relentlessly unstable, the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he wants to direct again. His character is absolutely unlikely, making it impossible to root him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the jury's startling make-up at the end of the film is cute, but this movie is just awful.
