This piece of crap was perhaps celebrated 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made with Native Americans played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was in fact a great racist, as was his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart shot actor Hal Williams out of the "Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series that floated mercifully) just because Williams was black. As if that was not bad enough, this movie is very outdated and boring. Instead, look at "Dances with Wolves" for a less racist perspective. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was filmed, and even with his ridiculous wig, after 16 years he still looked like a pedophile from Old Debra Paget. I am surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
