Falling into the movie category "Much too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments" to be taken seriously. While Scream, if you know what I did last Friday, my friend's thirteenth or back, know they're bad, not scarecrows. Evil Dead set such a high standard in comedy horror in a budget genre that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> There is an immediate suspicion of inexperience because there is no noise or vibration in the fuselage and cockpit of an airplane. The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc, but nothing comes. Although the men are obviously the scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this movie is too serious for it to be good for him might make for a grin. I can not remember if Joe Bob Briggs had ever seen a scarecrow, but I think he would not bend so low. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, there are many people who disagree.
