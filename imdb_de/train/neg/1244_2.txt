This is a premiere for me, for the first time I have been disappointed in a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes, and the awesomely great performance), but it could have been made by any commercial Hollywood director. The pace was very strange, the last third was just waiting for me and the cast until the movie was over. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only fun in the movie. Come back, Tim.
