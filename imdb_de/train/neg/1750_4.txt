HERA PHERI of Priyadarshan was a nice sitcom. The film lacks a story, but it's pretty funny, but illogical. <br /> <br /> Actually, they are not a real story, but somehow they make a nice river, even though it's nothing big. <br /> <br /> The first half contains 2 funny scenes like the one in the Akshay and Invite John Neha for lunch, and another when Paresh comes in. <br /> <br /> The first half gets slow but the second half is boring is funnier, even though she is not a script <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny, although you're surprised how they never get the voices of the to hear individual persons from the rooms? <br /> <br /> The confusion of the climax becomes like a stage play but it's pretty funny But the movie ends abruptly <br /> <br /> Direction is okay Music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar excels in his part that has now become his second skin, but that's it's his movie completely and he overshadows all the others. <br /> <br /> John stumbles through and fails in the comedy. Paresh Rawal is funny. Rajpal is fine. The girls are awkward and awkward Also, Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu can be seen now) are sometimes good, but too often screaming Manoj Joshi is okay
