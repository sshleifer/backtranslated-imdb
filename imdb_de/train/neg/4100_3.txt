A somewhat disappointing film, I would say: the acting was somehow stilted. In many cases, I simply could not believe that the facial expressions matched the spoken words or the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). That does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the authors who are believed to already know that the characters were right. They do things and say things that come out of nowhere: The character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals at dinner; then he blows up and storms out and tells his father: "Do not touch me, you ass!". If we had seen the prequel, maybe we would understand where it all comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are at sea for the reason! <br /> <br /> A strange, quirky thing that Andrew does is to go to an old quarry, to sit on the edge and overlook the "still water" underneath. Then he reaches into his jeans pocket, takes out a packet of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times during the movie; I think we should see this as a tortured act of aloneness and anger? Maybe once, but three times? It could even have been four times, I lost the count. To be honest, there is the fact that he recently found out that he was adopted; This happens very early in the movie, so there is no dramatic change he might suffer as a result of this discovery. It's not really clear if he's so bitter or if it's about something else. <br /> <br /> I think the movie has a kind of Lynchian feel, but should a first director really try to scale a mountain so early in his career?
