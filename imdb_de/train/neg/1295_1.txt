This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to have this movie - Asano is a terrific actor and the plot was very responsive. but I could not find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> the film lasts forever, until nothing happens. and the effects that the director used - such as percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - only compounded my growing annoyance that the plot was so incredibly slow and the performers ugly surpassed. Much of the boredom was the result of unnecessary additions that were utterly unnecessary, like an hour Asano had spent cutting Buddha statues and proclaiming nothing to worship. This did not add anything to the story. A Japanese comrade fanatic and I have both kept checking the time. We could not believe that this movie was as horrible as it was. and the final was awful. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for being able to get through this, but unfortunately I was wrong.
