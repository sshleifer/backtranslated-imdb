This movie is based on actual facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We can see that many armed police are emptying an equal amount of guns on two guys who only have armored torsos. That's a great idea; Target for the armor! ... Sorry, but how about those fat, fat, obvious heads or their legs because they screamed loudly. Or have invisible tanks protected them? Did you miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started decently, but after 20 minutes of shooting it's really a turn to boring. <br /> <br /> And that documentary style did not work for me either, but that's something you like or dislike. <br /> <br /> Incredible stuff that makes it hard to get through to the end. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for finishing.
