This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I've seen some pretty awful movies in my day, but they take the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe a word to describe how you will feel after seeing this cruelty. Please do yourself a favor, if you ever feel the urge to see this and see thirty minutes of this annoying purple dinosaur, Barney, then multiply that thirty times number and you would still receive only a small portion of the horror the You have in stock. To sum up, it can really be described as a horror movie, but only if you are prepared to become meaningless through the worst industry action and completely pointless story. Real Rating, -10 Disgusting
