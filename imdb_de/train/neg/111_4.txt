My interest in Dorothy Stratten led me to buy this video. Although there were great actors / actresses, there were just too many subplots to keep the interest. And it just was not that interesting. The dialogue was stiff and confusing, and the story just turned too much to be credible. I was pretty disappointed with what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's latest films. I'll love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
