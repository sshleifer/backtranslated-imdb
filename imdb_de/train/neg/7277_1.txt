"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst movie ever made, even surpassing the nonsensical "Plan 9 from space". At least that movie was just incompetent; The film by Lampoon, on the other hand, is both incapable and mean. Once upon a time, films respected the intelligence of their audience. However, this one keeps us a rotten, rotting corpse in front of the faces - and then tries to rub our noses in it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a bit of meat, and it's very nice meat. However, the directors do not seem to know that even T & A needs a good story to surround them. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Perversely, the filmmakers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays a young police officer who took up his duties on his first day at work. He is associated with a tired, cynical vintage car played by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we hope that this movie ends triumphantly. Surely we think the youngster's spooky attitude will affect the cynic and change him for the better. <br /> <br /> Abandoned hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the young man's spark will be washed away forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the bathroom and asks us to follow the drain. Nominally this is a comedy. But where is the humor?
