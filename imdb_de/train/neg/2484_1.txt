I still can not believe Wes Craven was responsible for this crap. This movie is worse than Deadly Friend. The plot is stupid, the acting is mediocre and the movie is deadly boring. I do not know why Wes Craven hates his debut "Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes (probably) this turkey. Do not get me wrong, I really like some of his films, but it was a real torture to sit and watch them.
