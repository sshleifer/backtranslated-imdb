In the film, I feel that it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than a way to tell a story on the screen. This short film by David Lynch tells a story, but not much of one. I thought it was funny, but too bizarre to be a comedy. It's a good movie production, but there's nothing else. As I said, I'm a big David Lynch fan, but I'm frustrated with some of his work because I do not see any need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he's done so far, but I know he has a lot of talent left and I'm curious to see what he's expecting us to do in the future. If you like Lynch, check this, but do not be surprised if you do not like it.
