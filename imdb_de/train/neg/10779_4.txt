I found this movie a complete disappointment. The talent available to the director, in particular Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four leading roles), was completely squandered on a merry, mediocre story whose conclusion one is not really interested in the terrible, stereotyped signs. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (seems to play her role of High Fidelity, without humor), Crystal just plays his old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter ego and Cusack just goes through his role, seemingly bored with the whole thing Project. <br /> <br /> For a "romantic comedy" there is absolutely no romance between the main characters, let alone the chemistry, and the comedy (possible SPOILERS) Well, the only moments of mild humor came from Cusack's role Big Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the scriptwriter who obviously could not show any originality. (Spoiler) Azaria was reasonably amusing when the Mexican lover and Walken took an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse Maverick Dogme director - but these parts had very little screen time, and instead Billy Crystal (spoiler) was treated his groin to give a dog a sniff. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely disappointed by a movie with lots of good ideas and the movie. At the same time, totally unwilling, one of exploring or elaborating on them instead using the same old genre clich√©s and even letting oneself down to the depths of almost persevering teen-movie humor. <br /> <br /> A very bad 4/10.
