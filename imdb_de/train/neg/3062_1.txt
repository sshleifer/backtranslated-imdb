Some may say something like "Baby Geniuses" with their giant robot infants or "Dumbo" with their psychedelic drug addict nightmare sequence would win the prize for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You could say that too, but you would be wrong. And behold, because I bring you: Santa Claus, the most helpless family movie since ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes that show kids from different parts of the world singing their bland themed songs (seriously, this section is almost 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the storyline!) too exciting Conclusion: Merlin emerges from nowhere and saves the day (does not matter, he comes from Barcelona), this is a childhood trauma at its best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I ... can ... these ... reindeer ... laugh ... do not get out ... .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this startling piece of garbage as if you were avoiding a sex-hungry whale during mating season. But when gay demons flare with a severe case of overreacting flu, that's for you. I think you should try it. But really, this movie is not worth your time or your sanity.
