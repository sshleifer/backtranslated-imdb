Nicholas Walker is Paul, the city of Reverand, married to Martha (Ally Sheedy) but also an ordinary womanizer and decides to fake his own death to flee his current affair Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, he gets an amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also available as a crazy old chicken coop, grazing in a kind of "Misery" style for good Reverand. It's sad to see a pretty good cast so wasted. Not least John Savage in a terribly forgotten role as a shitty private detective. In a movie that is billed as a "black comedy", you have to include BOTH elements in this movie. Although this brings the former up, but unfortunately contains nothing of the latter. In addition, you can not emphasize any of the characters and therefore has no interest in them. Technically not an all-encompassing bad movie, just an extremely memorable movie. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin. <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
