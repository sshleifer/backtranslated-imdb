I'm sick of making movies that sound entertaining in a one-line summary, and then end up with what you would find in the lower middle of a compost heap. Who knows: "Witchery" might have been interesting for the studios on a pitch, even with a "Big Name Cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, nudge-nudge) and the shower lovers of Hildegard Knef (I do not know, a woman ... <br /> <br /> But in the movie it just falls apart faster than a paper mache sculpture in a rainstorm - it looks like these unfortunate people are trapped in an island villa on the east coast, and one of They (a woman, I suspect) are targeted by a satanic cult to endure the child of hell while the others are in grotesque, tortuous ways. <br /> <br /> Okay, right there Here is a cross section of plots from "The Exorcist," "The Omen," "Ten Little Indians," and a few other smaller films in the satanic worship round, Amok Line, none of which is very entertaining, and most of the time, you go from scene to scene until it's over No, not even L but Blair and David Hasselhoff help a lot. They are only going to make a paycheck and do not seem very anxious to give her "everything." <br /> <br /> As it stands, Hasselhoff probably wishes he was back with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... on the run. a prominent PETA charity or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is today. <br /> <br /> And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people close their mouths, dangling in seething chimneys, lined up in trees during a violent storm, ships blown out of their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of the Devil" would be the most sadistic movie I've ever seen .... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. It is not worth your time. I can not believe I told you so much as I did. When you see it, just see if you can count the clich√©s. And yes, Blair gets obsessed, as if you did not see THAT coming down Main Street, followed by a brass band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will itch you.
