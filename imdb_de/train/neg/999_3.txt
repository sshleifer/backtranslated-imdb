I saw Descent at the Stockholm Film Festival last night and it was a big disappointment. Disappointment, because the action was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and a fan (sounds perverted, I'm not!) Of the 'rape / revenge' of the 70s, I was superfluous to say , very curious to check this movie. My conclusion: Let's stay with the classics! Yes, the plot has potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors are not convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that this is a true representation of the college world in the US, that the emptiness of the characters serves one purpose and all the jazz, but this makes the whole movie insignificant. Just as in the scene where Dawson is being raped: the intensity is seriously lacking! I did not expect anything irreversible, but do not we take pity on her? I have not had a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the photograph was impressive. Well, it's good, but not groundbreaking. I have to admit that the screenings at the festival were not that good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the film I could not help but think: I feel like Argentos 'Inferno'. lol. Seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully filmed and all but me had the bitter feeling of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American-Canadian border in Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk. the harsh red and blue light, the heavy bass music, the general, relaxed / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie. Too bad.
