"The Triumph of Love" triumphs over nothing. It's cumbersome, four hours of torture. It actually takes less than two hours, it just seemed much longer. It pains me even to think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not that terrible. Maybe they tried to be so exaggerated as to be clownish, but if they did, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not impress in one way or another. She is only there. I suspect the eponymous play Marivaux wrote about 270 years ago is much better. It could not be worse. Clare Peploe, the author and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the piece. I do not know what she thought when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything in the translation has been lost.
