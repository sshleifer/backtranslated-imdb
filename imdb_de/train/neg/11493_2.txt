Störtebeker is one of the worst TV mini-series ever produced on this planet. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is unbearable and the historical background is mostly nonsense: just two examples: Visby was shown as a village with three houses. Instead, it was a big city at the time, the best days have passed. Second, Hamburg would never have been the city to look after pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than that: the director! How can a dilettante like this guy run a movie like this? Impossible! There was no believable scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter in most tough scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how a big TV station can be so incompetent.
