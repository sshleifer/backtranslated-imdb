This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films filmed in Spain following the unexpected success of Italian "spaghetti" westerns, and offers, as is typical of such genre efforts, a diverse assortment of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, Fernando Rey, etc. Ironically, however, this incoherent confusion of a film is a shining example of this. Most American film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and are nowadays practically (or is that officially?) extinct. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie, not only because the Western was one of my favorite movie types, but also because it had all the features, including a fascinating premise to be a good one - not to mention from the fact that my dad had bought a paperback copy of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD's romanization, which corresponded to his original version Ease! The only virtue of the film (if you can even call it that) is its sheer eccentricity: Stevens, for example, plays a widow who revenges herself on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband (!) In a coach of her dumb Servant (?) Sutton drifting around; Savalas, a bloodthirsty renegade who seems at first glance to be the main villain of the film, is sent out early by his own henchman Lettieri in the picture; the villain of the play then turns out to be Landau, who in the very first scene of the movie plunders alongside our legendary hero who became a priest, Shaw; Fernando Rey, who plays a blind pawn, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who ends up being a mere front for ... well, never mind! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and becomes stranger from there! The production team responsible for this film was also behind other Western courts during the same period, such as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
