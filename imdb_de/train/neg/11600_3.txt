After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural step. They should have stopped it before it started. Alice, who survived Part 4, is pregnant and it seems Freddy uses her unborn child to come to his victims, which of course is Alice's friends. Strange nightmare movie, very heavy of religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
