I'm a fan of the best of the best films so far. But this was awful. No wonder I found it so hard to find it. I tried 4 video stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke and the action was bad too. <br /> <br /> I miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original Kickboxing characters and the theme this movie had with the first one, really 2 movies. <br /> <br /> John
