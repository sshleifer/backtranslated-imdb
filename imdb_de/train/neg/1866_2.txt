A cheap exploitation film about a mother's search for her daughter, kidnapped by people doing snuff porn movies. The path leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we fight in public to sleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of the countless softcore sleaze films made for people who want the excitement of porn without the stigma or the danger of it appearing on their credit card bill. Personally, I would prefer the stigma, as these films are usually more interesting and honest, which we see. This is supposed to be a sexy thriller, but it is not. Mostly people talk about things, followed by a lot of walking from place to place and lead to leadership. Throughout the film, various people undress and everything has more than a hint of S & M. The material for violence and fetish is more of a laugh than horror or excitement, it's all incredibly unreal. Worse, there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically synonymous for many of these films). <br /> <br /> You'll forgive my lack of details, but it's just a boring, boring movie that I stayed in until the very end, hoping that a little bit of crowding will happen, but there was nothing , The most interesting was the blonde dizziness with the huge bite and nose that was as big as a Buick. I watched her with morbid fascination, wondering what she looked like when she was a young girl, and wondering if she had undergone a plastic surgery and not the kinds of things you should think about in a thriller thriller.
