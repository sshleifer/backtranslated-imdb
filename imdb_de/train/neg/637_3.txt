The Good Earth is by no means a great movie, it's far too common. Maybe it was different in the thirties, but who would want to see the life of a farmer? That's not very interesting for me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are doing an excellent job, but the movie went on far too long. I could have told you the end of this movie on the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a short time builder who does not want to be like his own father, proves just like him. Both fall in love with their wives as well as their deathbeds. The movie makes a complete 360 ​​from generation to generation. Also in this movie, there were no good character actors or funny moments, it was just depressing, which stopped the farmers in times of crisis.
