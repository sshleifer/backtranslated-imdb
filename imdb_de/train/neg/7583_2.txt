David Lean's worst movie. Even "where we serve" was not that bad. Normally, a movie with such a reputation as this one has at least some redeeming qualities, which is why you understand why it can be considered a classic. But after seeing that, I just could not understand why this piece of crap was so popular in 1945! I liked the theatrical, stiff upper lips, British manners, stories and scripts (which are sometimes quite funny, but totally out of round) and soundtrack. The Elvira character should be tempting and attractive, but was actually ugly and had a funny and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust the reputation of a movie. Another overrated British classic.
