We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an id√©-recuce few would demand. Friends and family of this and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center could be shot by this damned movie. A sweet, serious, if tongue-tied, fireman remembers a confused journalist turning his fragments into a laudatory speech from lost colleagues. They think about the results. He murmurs something else, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that made several thousand laudatory speeches are overwhelmingly sad, but this clumsy, bland dramatization is boring.
