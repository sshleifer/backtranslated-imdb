If you want to see a smart, philosophical discussion about man's potential and potential, look at "Waking Life," which is brilliant. "What the # $ *! Do We Know" is in focus everywhere, badly addressed, poorly written, badly acted, completely out of art and completely annoying. It was not the least thoughtful or entertaining. The inclusion of the wandering freak "Ramtha" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Is not it curious how the filmmakers look at the fact that this woman is worshiping an approximately 2,000-year-old Atlantic god or something? What a flake is this old chick, and what a waste of my time and money was this movie. Those responsible for this movie should never shoot a movie again.
