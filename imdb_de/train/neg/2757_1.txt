I'm a guy who loves guy movies ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fight cool special effects in the army. All this happened, but this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go to a beach to relax when your life was in danger? The Serpent Dragon's actions themselves were very poorly written ... and the snake dragon's attacking skills varied widely across the movie, with the main characters having died several times. In the middle of the movie, the film was obviously not seen in the stressful times after it was made has been. I love movies, but I had to force myself to see it over. Thank God I did not buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy it, do not rent it, just look the discovery channel ... more exciting.
