"I Love New York" is another post by VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows the fun side of dating a shrill, vile woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the wildest, craziest candidate from Ebonics and her mother and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show". It's not as bad as the previous show "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a 90s sketch "In Living Color", where Keenan Ivory Wayans mimicked boxer Mike Tyson in the dating show "The Love Connection" and he chose "Robin Givens" for a date. Mike said that the date was okay, but how the disgusting mother kept intervening. This show reminds me. <br /> <br /> The men are selected and given names to humiliate themselves and the woman they are with - (I would think, an intelligent man looking for a smart woman, who Looking for a smart woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name so ghetto that you are ashamed every time you appear on TV.) Professional reality actors, so why bother. <br /> <br /> I miss the discovery of what's so entertaining about all of this. The fact that this is just as wrong as their newly implanted supplements? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in network advertising time? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make a dollar.) Maybe wonder, who would want to be with this woman for an hour? Or ask yourself if the next show with her mom would take place at the WWF! However you cut it, it's a train wreck that you've seen countless times. The shock level is now at zero. <br/> <br /> No twist or twist makes the wreck more interesting, or unlike any other. Appealed to the lowest common denominator and for those who demand an "end" of reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin, why they should end immediately.
