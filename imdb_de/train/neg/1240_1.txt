I think everyone was pretty disappointed with this sci-fi movie. First, it was led by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of a classic. I found it boring, rude and ridiculous. If you have seen it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone at Imdb says it's crap and boy, they're right! If not, avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
