I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the Running Man. So of course I was very excited that someone had made a movie of it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was ready for a night of fun! <br /> <br /> The first indication that something was wrong was when I noticed that somebody had occupied Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply could not believe that a man famous for movies that were filled with running and shooting could play a more sly role, as described in the book. I was still convinced that this would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I soon found out that the only reason he played himself was because someone wrote the entire story in MAKE that he wanted to fight and shoot. Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: Hero is done wrong, Hero solves problems by bending his powerful muscles and scares everyone and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said. I know that books can not literally be shown on screen, but this did not even have links to the book. Stephen King should have publicly denounced any affiliation to the film, and he should have banned the title The Running Man for this shameless film waste. I do not say it often, but this movie was bad. If I was not home, I would have put foul tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I've worked a lot with "someone." I did that because I'm sure many people are ashamed to have worked on it, and I do not want to embarrass them even further, by calling them here
