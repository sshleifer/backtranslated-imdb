I can not believe how bad this garbage is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words contradict the description of this bad made bitch! The synchronization is in no way consistent with the actor's mouths. The movie looks like it was filmed with a vintage 70s camcorder. I have taken better movies with my phone camera. The blood is ridiculous because of the stupid unbelievable conspiracy. Acting is what you would expect if you call all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and then completely rip them off and then try to play a play in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I love zombie movies, but the production values ​​in this movie are so low that they are hard to beat. Avoid!
