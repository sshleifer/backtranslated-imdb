I've read reviews that you seem to have been a very strict British school student in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe that's true, if so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************* ************* ************************************************** *** The end makes as much sense as all the kids who are against the government and against the corporation without having them. A better solution that does not burn society to a Mad Max slag. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters could go, but they do not. The reasons for which they are going do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What it means to shoot a bunch of innocent people is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the last creative expression, possibly the only revelation that all the characters of this film have, and that does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The characters who make a murder rush do not fight the institution, they just kill people. I thought they used all the explosives to blow up the place, or at least the sanctuary, that would have symbolically made more sense, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This movie is a daydream of a teenager who is fighting the authority that plagues her although she is actually needed. It has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning. This movie simply portrays the imagination of killing teachers and people in "power" who annoy you. <br /> <br /> If you think a Murder Madness / School Shooting similar to that of Columbine or Virginia is a sensible and sensible way to engage with teachers and institutions you do not like, then you will love this movie , If you're like me and working to make a living for yourself rather than just rebel (blindly in this movie) against "the man", this movie is youthful and boring. <br /> <br /> It can also be said in part that the funding was missing, and the story seemed to have a hint of attention deficit syndrome. All in all, this seems to be a very crude idea of ​​what one could have been Okay film, but no effort is made in dialogue, character development or morality, so it's easy. .. poorly made. <br /> <br /> If ... only I could get my two hours back.
