It's always hard to make a sibling better in your life than you, always a struggle to get out of this shadow and not let the bitterness keep you away from your family. So imagine that your older brother is Santa, and then imagine how hard that must be. That's the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays Titular Fred, a bitter loser who spends a lot of energy making sure people do not expect them to do good things or give something to his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the reckless, armor-hungry, somewhat scary guy Fred wanted him to be. If you do not know, Fred needs a financial favor and must make up for it by helping his brother on their way to Christmas. And follow fun and hours of life. <br /> <br /> Well, that should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie with a few good moments of Vaughn's patented quick-talking, a ridiculously out of nowhere music video moment. Kevin Spacey plays an auditor to finish Santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest.) Bad guys I've seen in a while), not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elven outfit (to be honest, though he's a highlight) and a movie that floats too bitter to feel like a good seasonal food, but in the second half too bland to deal with all the bad things of the commercialism of the time how to feel fun. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is there, as well as Kathy Bates, but it is really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style, you will find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, this seasonal stinker is only recommended. Outside of Vaughn's ghost, the script barely raises anything decent, except for a particularly good scene where a fun support group has a very specific problem to deal with. David Dobkins Director is as mediocre and confident as the 20s A Christmas card you send to your aunts you have not seen in 10 years, and he seems to think that putting together the ingredients without a good mix or proper care is delicious Christmas pudding guaranteed. No, we get a burnt, filthy lump with too much sugar over it. Forget it and stick it back to the funny elf if you're looking for a great, modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: Santa Claus 2, Santa Claus, Santa Claus 3: The Escape Clause.
