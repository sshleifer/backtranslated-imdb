Not that "a movie by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I have to admit that ZODIAC KILLER has managed to exceed my deepest expectations. There is a new trend among younger filmmakers to use digital video for their early projects. This is good and good for giving these children the opportunity to work without spending all their money on expensive film stocks. However, many of these young filmmakers are also aware that they filter the finished film so that it looks qualitatively like a celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video works only for the "mockumentary" style, as it never looks like anything other than video. This is the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a soap opera about a murderer during the day. It does not feel like you're watching a movie. Even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that it is virtually impossible to produce horror (or even suspense!) On video. Out of love for God, this guy has directed since the sixties! Perhaps he is the only director who has not improved in his forty-year career. And luckily he also wrote the screenplay! So you can expect kinky actions that mean nothing, unauthorized behavior and at least one truly presumptuous plot that will leave you completely unsatisfied. Please do not miss this movie. You will thank me later.
