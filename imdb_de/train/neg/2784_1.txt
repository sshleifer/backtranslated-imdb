My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same community as the scriptwriter of the movie. We were very upset that the JCC is bringing this film to its Jewish film festival because the mentally disabled character Frankie is being portrayed. We watched this movie in the local theater when it came out. We demanded money back. We'd like to encourage the scriptwriter to donate part of the money to the JCC's Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We did not want to see Frankie - a mentally disabled and maybe even autistic teenager - as part of a joke He always drops something to look at the nanny's breasts. There was no point in Frankie's figure except saying, "Hey, being mentally handicapped is funny." Challenges like Frankie are serious business. Families like mine really suffer. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter must explain himself. Does she know families with disabled children? Do you see families with disabled children in the JCC pool week after week?
