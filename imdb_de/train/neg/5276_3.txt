No, this is not that fairy tale about the pumpkin slide, the fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but if I went into detail, I would have to ruin it for you, which I will not do. But do not be overwhelmed by curiosity, because this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those films that start promising before they reveal the audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent plot. And that's a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon while the other is your dutiful, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Her relationship is like a hand in hand, so close that you see her as a sibling rather than a parent-child. But things go awry (not always) when Hyun-soo's friends, whom Yoon-hee has operated on, go insane. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a warning to the public and to these Korean ladies who are not going to look at news to be believed. The only truly scary moments are these plastic surgery scenes, though I somehow thought Kim Ki-duk's time would actually have more Gore in describing and describing the operations during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> two halves, with the fist an attempt to shock the audience with standard anxiety tactics, which I occasionally come to. The second half, however, degenerated the film into mindless mumbo jumbo melodrama, and he was quite anxious to force his ideas down his throat. Some things do not start to make sense and although it's always trying to explain, you probably will not buy it, not that horror movies are logical. <br /> <br /> The leads are all beautiful and aside from the police's negligible role, there is a significant lack of male presence. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the plot could have been vastly improved. I would recommend that you only see this if you are a fan of mediocre Korean horror on VCD. Watch out for those crazy moments!
