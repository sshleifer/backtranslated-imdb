Did not care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your website ... I just found the answer to my question. Now I look like a dummy, but I think I'll still submit my comments. and yes, British Columbia is beautiful *** Or why was it taken from the coast of South Carolina Coastal? (This question applies) The location was essential to the subject of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. I'm just reading where I have to write at least ten lines. Here is my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I made of the book. I know the book was the book and the movie; Well, not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also recalled rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was visually more impressive, it distorted the feeling of the story and seemed to contradict the characters.
