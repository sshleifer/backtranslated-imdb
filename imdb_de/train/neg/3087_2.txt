A group of extremely unlikely A-holes are tormented by lame dolls who have locked up some older night watchmen in a movie vault without any reason. <br /> <br /> Many people only know this movie from MST3K's selective rippling of the strip. But I have seen the actual movie and can say for sure that it is really bad, really, really bad. From one of the most frightening "fight" scenes I've ever seen, the stuffed toy "Aliens", which suffers from lack of exercise (I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier), to the cruel acting (I had a My Pet Monster, which was more charismatic) However, the "Vice Academy" films by Rick Sloan are somehow and I think I have no earthly idea of ​​how much worse. This does not mean that this movie is anything but crap because it is not. Just throw it out. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: No nudity in the actual movie, but in the DVD are 2 pairs of tits. Introducing the movie <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Stills gallery; and trailer for this movie
