Let me say by saying that I saw the video and saw Saw, and after Bleed Saw looked like the biggest horror movie of all time, though I thought it was just pretty good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is the female nude act. The Gore is very fake and overworked. It has its funny parts, but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see the horrible end. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses. The only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has starred in over a hundred other videos and I have seen two other members of the cast in equivalent or worse films. You must not continue this madness.
