We rented the DVD and hope for a good Western. The movie was pretty and the scenes appropriate, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> Why did the villain in the first part kill the mine owner? Not really connected to the movie except to see how bad he was and to hide. <br /> <br /> The banker who has gone bad is simply too bad to convincingly decide to hire killers for his employers. At least let us guess. No character developed for the bank owners or the bank employees. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in many events. <br /> <br /> Absurd premise that Martin would still have to see the judge after The gang confessed to killing the parents-in-law. Even more absurd that he admits, judging and judging, the sheriff does not listen. Even more ridiculous that Martin breaks his trailer and his rope, then the sheriff brings him at gunpoint to finally return to his city and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Would not he simply return after the gang's fast posting to save his wife and arrest a bad guy? Just send the judge a note that the gang was standing before being killed on the trail ???? !!! Overall, very sad acting and no sense of film.
