Author and director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his own play about a straight widowed widow, and has learned in the last three weeks that he is HIV positive; He seeks the homosexual partner he has ever had, takes him to an apartment and ties him up, forces the guy to take a blood sample, and promises bloody revenge if the results are positive again. A fascinating idea sounds better on paper than it sounds. James Marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's artificial behaviors are confusing - it's like seeing a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more demanding role, but his personality, which turns from the shy guy to the kidnapper on the sidelines, can not convince. The conversations of the two men are not convincing. Of course, Marsden's gay partyboy is not apathetic - he currently has a sympathy for Speedman's misery - but he does not react the way a gay man would be in this case. The film is not a cop-out, but a scam, which is further hampered by the poor editing, the ill-conceived flashbacks, the low-budget production and the grand finale, which smells of silly claim and soul melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
