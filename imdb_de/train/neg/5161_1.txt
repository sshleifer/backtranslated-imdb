In my life, it's about saving animals. I work as a volunteer at a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal myself for my life. I can not even kill a spider, I'm putting it outside. The scene where children throw rocks at the bird until it dies. Previously, he was involved in trying to be accepted by the other children. It simply convinces me that people are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The end - the foster parents take over earlier - does not trigger the depiction of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want his child to see this movie?
