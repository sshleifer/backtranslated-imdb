Impressive. That's about as much as I can say right now. Who writes the stuff? Who produces the stuff? Which actor who is holding something would agree to "act" in this stuff? Oh dear God! I do not know how I made it through this movie, but I assume that I drank 8 cups of coffee that day to keep me awake. Good Lord! It was one of the most withered and predictable pieces of cinematography I've ever seen ... and I do not intend to "experience" it again for the record. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She is cool. I'll take a look at it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to see it without moaning every five minutes and wondered when that pile of crap would finally come to an end. But I was not successful. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. I mean ... what about this thing, where he imagines what would happen, and then get back to real life? That was annoying enough when his dad did Parenthood ten years ago. The "jokes" - and BELIEVE me, it takes me MUCH to call them that - are stupid, the characters are banal and forgetful, the plot is completely predictable HISTORY RECORDS! I should have thought something was wrong when I realized that I'd never heard of this movie. It was most likely a direct DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone thinking of looking at this, I have some advice. NOT! For the love of God ... NOT !!! I am ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, and I mean, NOBODY would like to buy it from me! And I talk to second-hand and second-hand junk shops who buy the mud from their shoes and put it in the shop window. That should let you know how CRAP is.
