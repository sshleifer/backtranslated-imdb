Incredible! <br /> <br /> This movie gets 7 out of 10 points. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The drama was not only incredibly bad, the plot (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Of course, everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not bad, if you can fascinate the audience already in this moment. This is not the case. There is no action, no tension, not even a spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and the 2 only for try
