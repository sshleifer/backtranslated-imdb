This movie had potential and I was ready to give it a try, but there are so many timeline issues that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow, treated like an idiot. Rise to Power begins the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set between the mid and late seventies. To be realistic, the film would have to be filmed in the fifties, if not in the late forties. Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando, with which Carlito allegedly walked on his "Hey-Day". None of the main characters of the original film was in this film. We're supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking along the beach talking about retiring in paradise, what he wanted in the original movie. In addition, the Pre-Quel creates the characters of Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them, since they are clearly not in Carlito's way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito has the relationship with the Italians he had in the original film and watched the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? The two films are probably seven years old and he spends five of them in jail. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that nobody was interested in telling a good story, and that they were more interested in making money with an average gangster movie and threw a character called Carlito Brigante into the story. The movie had some good moments, but I think it would have been better to leave this film to itself rather than try to make it a precursor to Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the movie The only advice I can give is not to consider the movie as a linear pre-source. Think of it as the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's unnamed man, in other words, two films that have the same character but are not necessarily related.
