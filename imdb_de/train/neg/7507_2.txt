This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of the great talent that would ever agree to appear in such a garbage. I imagine Hollywood Blvd had some strangled agents. as a result of this fiasco. What you really get is that it could have been good. The directors inspire and the topic was sufficient to arouse interest and ticket sales. This is a flop though. The many storylines stretch from the end to the end of the pictures from bad to stupid, and you feel like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be lazy. What Spike can achieve is a revenge against any Italian who has beaten or insulted him as a child, as the film is a whole bunch of outdated and probably insulting Italian clich√©s. As with any Spike Lee movie, there is some truly thought-provoking and magical camera work. He has the gift of packing your psyche and bringing you into his vision, if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you observe the other 2 hours of head scratching and the clock as you wonder and wait for the end to be there somewhere?
