This is a very confusing movie. The movie is very hard to follow and the plot just did not seem to make sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain. When a movie is synchronized from one language to another, it is not translated as it was originally intended. Maybe that's part of the problem, but I doubt it can explain all the problems with this movie. The synchronization is pretty bad and the voices are not very good with the characters. The scenes are choppy, there are a number of strange and irrelevant characters that hardly confuse the viewer. What I liked about this movie was the look of the Wolfman himself and the scenes in which he attacks. If they could put everything together and make sense, they might have had something. Do not waste your time with it.
