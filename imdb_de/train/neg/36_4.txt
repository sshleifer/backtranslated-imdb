This movie seemed too long after 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror movies is that there are always too many shots of people (through the jungle, on a rocky cliff, near a river or a lake) running to compensate for the runtime. The film is worth seeing for the ridiculous and nude native zombie with big, plump, bloody eyes, which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and a lot of reverberation. Eurotrash fans are entertained by the bad English dubbing, the free female meat and the very stupid makeup jobs for the monster and the local extras. This was pretty easy for a zombie / cannibal strip, but then I probably did not see an uncut version.
