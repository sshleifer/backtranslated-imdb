In a way, the concept behind the plot was a pretty interesting mix of different types of movie in an interesting combination. No point in this movie, however, was so obvious that he did not deserve close-ups. I had the feeling that I had been hit over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the ill people. The writer seems to have picked up clich√©s from other films simply as a substitute for customized writing lines to actual characters. The actors did not help. No chemistry I think they should develop some sort of attraction, if only because that's an essential element of these stories. However, the authors did not work very hard on the development of chemistry. Sure, both are attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other seemed to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The self-esteem that shows Turner's character at Sabato has grown way too fast and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is said to be a discredited doctor who just does not seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character on Independence Day. Usually, this type of character should show talent or brilliance. Sabato's character does not do it. He is Cassandra with the crazy and all the prophetic abilities of a magical eight ball. He seems to be right by accident. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are funny. Each actor really tried more than a little too hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on him. The symptoms looked like a bad mood, like the video from the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
