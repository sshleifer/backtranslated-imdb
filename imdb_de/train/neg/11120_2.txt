You know that a movie is bad when the highlight is a short moment of "Jeopardy!" You can see. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that it has tremendous potential. I have lived for several years in an area very similar to the one shown in this film. The tensions between the races were high, and basketball meant something for everyone. A movie about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre drama and the bad script in White Men Can not Job left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the movie is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money by playing basketball. He then returns home and sits down with his girlfriend. and the process is repeated. Most stories have reached their peak, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this replay (in this case, "Billy wins or loses money when playing a game of basketball"). <br /> For a plot to develop, a dilemma must be solved; and this dilemma must be interesting, if the movie will be interesting too. Apparently, the authors of White Men Can Jump forgot the rule because the act is summarized as "Billy must pay the bills." I appreciated the variety of other formulaic sports movies, but - I'm sorry - that was just awful. I could have been less worried if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. Despite everything, White Men Can not Jump is a successful movie. Obviously, some avid sports fans will reject terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in it. I'm sure others were lured by the big names who played the lead roles. I wonder if the cast has been completely replaced by previously unknown actors and the basketball theme has been replaced by lacrosse. Would anyone have bothered to watch this movie? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie two out of ten stars. the extra star is for the "danger!" Scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek
