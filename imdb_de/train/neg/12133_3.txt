What are you doing now? <br /> <br /> Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a combination of acting workshop, indie film and theater. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing actors love - it's kind of a workshop or a play because it's mainly about acting ... annoyed, tense, scared, entertaining, planning, planning - Give the performers a lot of freedom to really stop everything. <br /> <br /> A trio of crooks, a leader, an idiot, a brother, comes up with a big Heist plan. .. and a wrench is thrown into the factory. To top it off, there is a bit of "Fender Bender" and one of the crooks tossed through the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The cops are at their tail and stumble into a bar called Bar's poetic (and priority) "Dino's last chance". As a director, Spacey tries to keep the focus on the performances of the actors and the delivery of Dialouges. He walks over to a bright red cigarette sign of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he really keeps the violence out. <br /> <br /> I think that was a mistake. The concentration on the intensity and cruel, violent scenes would have given the film a certain lead. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is that it moves too slowly and suffers abuse in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to be pondering and immersing himself in the fact that he is a spiderless day. Along with these guys and Joe Mantaga, he is a traditional, foul-smelling madman police lieutenant who has his fingers crossed, but he has nothing to do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who believes in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or seek a way out. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create and sustain a lot of tension. The characters mostly chat and try to think of a plan ... and they are too calm and too articulate. There is even a scene in which the crooks play billiards with a whole swarm of armed police ready to strike. Once, one of the crooks even calls the police, which is located right in front of the bar. Oh brother. Oh, the trouble. <br /> <br /> These bulls will either blow them away or lock them up. Should not the scoffed crooks be a little scared, a bit restless? Meanwhile, the actual action is inside. <br /> <br /> Someone pulls out a weapon, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation outside the screen, and there is another victim, that ... well, a little sad. But ... Faye Dunaway should also have spent more time with a dialect trainer to improve her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A police officer looking for a pile of matches at the worst possible time is a nice look. And this is the scene in which someone walks through the rear window. <br /> <br /> The Dialouge is obviously trying to pick a David Mamet approach, and it's so mundane, but never so realistic or enlightening. <br /> <br /> The movie feels like too much of what he really wants ... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera, the first time other actors from a script leads, which is "not bad, but still needs some rewriting". Spacey shows he's not a dreadful director, but he lacks a sense of "making a movie," and it feels like he's only acting. These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. Like I said, the movie really suffers from abuse. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast but put them in the wrong roles. I think changing some of the roles would have helped immensely. <br /> <br /> After longtime mob actor Joe Mantagna played the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese was the outraged police lieutenant outside commanding his megaphone, barking at his troops, the fisherman in his "bloodthirsty idiot" section and kept Matt Dillion as a sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement. <br /> <br /> If some actors direct it, that works. You can even win Oscars for it. Mostly when actors direct, they tend to focus only on the performances. Just turn the actors on. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but you need a good showcase. An apology for that. <br /> <br /> Hostages are all the same in real life as they are in old-age stories, so it's only natural that films about them go from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some really great entries in this genre. Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about hostage-taking: "The Negotiator". <br /> <br /> This will certainly not be a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Nevertheless, there are a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end it is instantly forgotten and the kind of movie that is seen on regular television best could be played. It's just not worth it to go the way to see it. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other director: "Beyond The Sea" was supposedly a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You have to fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
