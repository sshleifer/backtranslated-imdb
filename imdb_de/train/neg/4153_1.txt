I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember a movie that's been so bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and dumbbells !! ;) Even that could not save this movie from a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand in front of a camera (or lying in this case). <br /> <br /> I was pretty disappointed general "zombie" effect. Since zombies seem to be so commonplace in this movie that they run over a couple here and there and casually talk about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair, but no indoor), the zombie movie genre is not even a factor even if a cameo of a dozen zombies that tear off a girl's clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> On to the vampires: Apparently all zombies are male and all vampires are female I'm not sure how vampires are in the daylight or why / why a soldier - vampire stood in the middle of the road and still holding his weapon with a stake in his heart and only waiting for the queen of the vampires The last section in the old convent made no sense, and as one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire, "Do you think we've done the right thing?" The killing of the two apparent heroes in the movie was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The drama and special effects were also at an all time low. They could almost see the tubes from which the wrong blood was pumped out during the close-up of the zombie run over by the general. Speaking of General, where did you like THAT Kenny Rogers anyway? No idea what he was the General apart from generally confusing and misguided ones. All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong desire to waste $ 3. Only my $ 0.02.
