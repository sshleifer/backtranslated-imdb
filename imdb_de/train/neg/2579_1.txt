I have to say that I used to be a big fan of the series. The first three were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame, because this was a great show and it's getting worse and worse. I know that they are made for DVD movies, but a little effort would be nice. <br /> <br /> There are no laughter, just a few good one-liners that bring a smile, if that's the case. There are pretty nude and very hot girls. But neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work. <br /> <br /> In addition, this is also a RACIST movie or as a racist of a movie you can do without being asked to be racist. I am NOT one of the people who think that everything should be politically correct. But the representation of minorities is very offensive. I would not waste time with this garbage. See the previous versions, they will not make you laugh ill.
