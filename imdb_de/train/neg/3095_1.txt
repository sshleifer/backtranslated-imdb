Wow, after some attempts, I finally managed to finish this god-fearing movie, just to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a direct video sequence this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the films that have been reviewed by MST3K - and they are really digging from the bottom of the barrel, seeing the respected bad "manos", "werewolf", "the incredibly strange" and the lesser known ones Search catastrophes like "Laserblast", "Zombie Nightmare". 'and' Time Chasers' - this must surely be the absolute largest pile of garbage they have ever seen (which makes it perfect for riffing). The film is very simple and is about a bunch of Munchies-like Gremlins who exploit people's desires for fame, fortune, skill and, of course, sex in ways that cause people to be killed. But that's the kind of movie where the drama is so ridiculous (a machismo test is shown, for example, by two men fighting garden tools in the front yard), writing is as forced (as the often-described) scene of a Gremlin who hangs on the arm of a girl who would notice it, if she only turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time this happens), and the story is so ... hardly noticed (hence the MST3K riff about a "law of the future where films from FILMmakers have to be made) - that you actually make the furry puppets kill everyone on the screen, worst film ... ever.
