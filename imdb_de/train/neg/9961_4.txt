Amelia and Michael are a married couple cheating on each other. Amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two smolder with their unfaithfulness, but finally manage to get in touch with each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much to this brief moment. The direction is straightforward and dramatic, which is good, the spectacle is sincere, but history leaves much to be desired. Why exactly do these two people interest us? It's a bit hard to see how this story sets itself apart from any other infidelity story except that it's much less important and does not seek meaning in it (a welcome change, if anything) I do not know, it's possible that I do not associate with these stories because I have never experienced them. However, I've found that the blockages in these stories are usually the same, meaning a couple talking to each other while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines for something else, and I would like to see a different setting , <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
