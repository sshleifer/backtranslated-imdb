Yes, that's one of THESE films, so terrible, so bland, so banal, that you can not stop laughing. I've seen comedies, good comedies, and less than my wife and I laughed about this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so uncomfortable that they cheer on the rats, the effects are so bad that you're wondering whose elementary school the art class was in charge of. But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we did not see the rat until the end surprised me more. Often the "big one" is not shown to the end, because the budget is limited and good effects consume so much money. I suspect, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden to the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy who walked around like a woodchuck disguised with Third World dentistry. > The grandest part of the entire movie is the elevator scene. After finding out that the rats could not stand a loud noise (migraine due to the bad effect?), The main buddy calls a fire alarm to frenzy the rats. If you ever want to see a pair of rat waltz while blood gushes out of their heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and convince yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, OK?
