I saw this movie on a video CD some time ago. <br /> <br /> I will mention the good points first. <br /> <br /> The film first tries to appear at least as if it were not biased, as showing one sign as not black and the other as white. Both protagonists are friends and coexist very well in a country and an economy that is not booming and does not fail at the same time. Their families come together and celebrate parties and practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle Shooting, as comrades not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first fifteen minutes, the storyline runs into a road fork. The audience is expected to believe that these friends have to hate each other for some unknown reason. For some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on a conflict path. Sure, the script adds TV footage that the characters seem to see live in English, but the clips are from 1993, not 1992, when the war started. The history, the elections of 1990, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film attempts to blame Karadzic, who was previously the presidential candidate and chairman of the second largest party in the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian constitution, the SDP was to assume the presidency in 1992, but a coup took place in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party took total control and conducted a separate referendum in March, making it a law in Bosnia, and the secession deliberately divorced the man from STtH. He was a student of National Socialism in World War II. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf" in which he stated: "It is indeed impossible for peace or coexistence to exist between" the Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions. In 1990, he lost the IDAP Elections to "Pro-Jugoslavia Moderate" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War and treated his followers as brothers, was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election but conquered the powerhouse Events from above are missing in the movie, but they are the facts that lead to war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props, Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet WWII helmets they did not use In addition, one soldier held an M-1944 WW2 rifle, used only by the USSR and not Yugoslavia, and the director and scriptwriters had a chanc e, but they decided to rewrite the story.
