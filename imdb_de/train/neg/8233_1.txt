This was probably the worst movie ever. I could actually do better, it was not even set up properly. It's like this movie has a $ 5 budget and is left with change. Do not look at it. I did not go through the whole movie, had to turn it off. I gave this 1/10 because it was weird how the producer of this movie wanted a horror movie that actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a few girls bumped into a car, broke a headlight and the owner of the car followed them. The piece I saw was a woman with a gun telling a load of girls to take off their clothes. What the hell? it also has to be a kind of cheesy porn film.
