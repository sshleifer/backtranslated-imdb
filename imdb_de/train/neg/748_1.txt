I love movies and I watch every movie to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie that I can not see through. The drama is terribly old-fashioned and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek who has done it with minimal software in his mother's basement, and ..... the long scenes where you can just walk !!!! And this movie is for three hours !!! I did not even manage 15 minutes until I fast-forwarded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of calling this "War of the Worlds", we call him "War of the Walking Long Distances". That cost $ 5 million! What are you spending the money on, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but on the positive side, a scene you have to watch is when the aliens start killing people. That's funny, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they squirm for another 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you're a fan of boring people, obsolete, action-less movies, here's a DVD for you. But I did not write that for you, I wrote this for billions of people who will hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know this is the book, but the book is not that long and I'm a complete bookworm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's ten times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give a big, fat zero of 10 points.
