I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Fascinating story, interesting character contours, Ewan Macgregor in the absolutely glorious overall picture. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway was so excited to present the film uniquely and not for the benefit of the film. I will not even go into Vivian Wu's vile acting. <br /> <br /> You are distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy displayed on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music. It seems he has lost sight of the story itself and the plot's development, and has entangled in foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with it. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a chunky Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" In big, sparkling letters. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a victim of Director Egutor's ego instead of what he could have been - disturbingly and frighteningly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?) It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best to refer to the visual arts, who take themselves too seriously.
