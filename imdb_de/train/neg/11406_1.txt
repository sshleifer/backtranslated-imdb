But I got over it. It seemed to me that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I was so sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau, who was evil. I just got the impression that the comparison was a bit hard and unrealistic. Really, the movie was bad. I would not really see it unless you are ready for a big disappointment.
