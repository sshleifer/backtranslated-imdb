Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first starring role, reveals her rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this an instrument of political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? As a committed real-life feminist, she must have appreciated this script. No wonder the left-wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie. It is also in his political alley. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad that Judd has risen from this moronic down to better roles in films that not only entertain the Liberal liberal agenda but entertain them.
