When I speak of Malice as a noir film, I do not compare it to masterpieces like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon or compare director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I'm just registering a protest against the darkness that permeates this movie from start to finish, so much so that you can not usually tell what's going on. I can understand darkness in night scenes, but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, so I can not understand. It would not have made much difference if director Becker had shot it in total darkness.
