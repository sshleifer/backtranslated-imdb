Be ashamed of Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra, who have seemingly lost their intelligence over the years, offering consistent prices for Tripe in this piece of film that is not even worthy of You Tube standards. I bit my teeth all through the movie to end up in the schizophrenic direction, a line that had never quite materialized, and in the last scene, I was just ashamed that my country and its Crorepati filmmakers were stupid enough to do that can "put on it". Be ashamed of the actors for accepting this work and even for doing a job that they can own. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in the choice of your film. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty, and Akshay appears as a joke. Anil another delay with a pubescent fascination with English. His cronies were praiseworthy in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to place a blood vessel. DO NOT AVOID brain cells, energy or your money to see this. Go SEE / Rent AMU instead of Konkana Sensharma - a beautiful piece of independent film that ever comes from India. Intelligent, poignant and a wonderful story that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me the hope that not everything is lost in Indian cinema.
