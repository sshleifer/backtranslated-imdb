Recently I decided to see Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder, as it is called in Holland. When I bought the movie, it struck me that Michelle Pfeiffer was the main character, and I thought that would have to say something about quality. Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. During the movie two storylines are running at the same time. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the film, I have been waiting for the moment when these two lines of action would come together so that the plot is clear to me. But it is still not the case. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the film states that the film will be about Natica Jackson. It is good sometimes. As I said, the film includes two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. Another title for this film would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> At the conclusion of my story, I strongly recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs. On the shelf in the store in a place that nobody can see it. That way you will not waste 90 minutes of your life the way I did.
