Impressive! I've seen the trailer for this piece and though 'No, this is not for me'. I watched the faces of my husband and friend during the caravan and knew it was a boy's movie. I mean, hello! a bunch of chick-barmaids dancing - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started to look, it did not look so bad. So I kept watching. I have seen it to the end. What a great movie. If anything, this is a chick movie. These girls have an attitude. It really is a feel-good movie and a love story. really leaves you with a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically the story of a girl from a small town that makes it big in the city after walking through the usual big city. There were a few of them, it's almost a new urban legend. but you also think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, me anyway. I think it's because all the work in a bar scene is very familiar, not just to me, but to a lot of people I know. Do not trust the followers for this - it aims to bring in the men.
