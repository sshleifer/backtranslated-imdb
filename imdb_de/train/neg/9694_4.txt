Otto Preminger directs this light like a feather story. The Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widow father David Niven are on holiday in the south of France with the nutty Mylène Demongeot. It's going to be fine until her friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. That's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as he did with all the women of his past ... including Demon Kill). When it looks as if she will become the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg takes revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from the point of view of Seberg and skilfully combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. The cinematography of Georges Périnal is breathtaking. The film features some of Preminger's most unpopular directing, though he rarely allows close-ups, making it difficult to discern the actors' emotions. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it's full of sour dialogues and funny scenes (mostly with an in-bird demon kill). Seberg is doing pretty well, but Niven is the least appealing ... and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger is really wrong with this casting. It's a role that seems tailor-made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's wanton admirer and Martita Hunt as the daffodil mother. Juliette Gréco sings the theme song in a Parisian nightclub. The great titles are from Preminger regular Saul Bass.
