I understand what this movie was about. How the ancients are often ignored and treated as anger, which means that they feel unworthy and that their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with this message, but I just feel it could have been conveyed in a way that is not so painful to look at. I enjoy a good art movie, but when a movie gets too self-confident (like in this case), the result is often frustrating. Including shots of a person who packs a suitcase slowly, it only takes 5 minutes for the audience to get angry. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you just want to tell them to pull yourself together. This is a movie that you think you should enjoy or value. He certainly has his advantages, but I was just too frustrated when I looked at him to ever recommend him to anyone. It could have a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (like 'Notting Hill'), but that was at least a movie you could enjoy.
