I saw this show and just did not like it. It could have been the first episode. Lately, I find out that ABC plays a lot of stupid shows these days and fails as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and the script are pretty awful and would still bring the show to a standstill. I'd say that I believe this show is canceled, but since ABC is pretty dreadful for the quality of the shows they play, they may find it easy because it's average compared to them.
