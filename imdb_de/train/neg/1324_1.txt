"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is another of those surrealist films that is extremely sophisticated, but just sets the viewer to sleep. As with other films of this kind, there are limited dialogues. Everyone is more interested in the visual aesthetics of the recording. However, cinematography stinks so there is nothing to attract your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this movie is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in the movie". Yes sure. It's high up, with exciting events like a bucket of melted ice or a turtle running a mile. 1.10
