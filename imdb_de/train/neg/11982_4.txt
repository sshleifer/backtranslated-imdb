In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) oversee their children's wedding, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before the party, Mrs. Dressler hands over the reign of her small city bank to her little Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings with it many bank closures and financial insecurity. Banker Foster can survive on the wise planning of Mother Dressler. Ms. Moran, however, is worried about her assets and calls loudly for a complete withdrawal. Other "Warren Bank" customers hear Moran's scream and ask about their own solvency. Soon the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Dressler's big critical and financial movie hit "Emma" was released earlier this year, and MGM soon wanted a new Dressler movie as possible. Dressler's hits of 1931, Reduce and Politics, still made a lot of money; According to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications, Dressler had become the # 1 US Box Office Star in 1932. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated the status of Dressler, but the production seems unusually sloppy and hurry. The cast is good, considering. A little more care in direction and cut and some repetitions would have helped? Apparently they needed it in the cinemas for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
