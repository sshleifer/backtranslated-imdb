I do not like this movie, but I also did not think much of the book, which, though praised by many as a "masterpiece", was lack of character development and incoherent and illogical plot in action, though it was far more readable than Fantes' frightening first Trial "Road to Los Angeles", which was only published when Fante came into fashion in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued by what soup Towne would make with such lean ingredients. He worked hard to fix the many shortcomings of the book, but my money did not save it. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while trying to stay true to the book. I think this movie is Towns folly. <br /> <br /> In a word: forget.
