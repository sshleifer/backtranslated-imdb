In the mid-1990s, I once wrote WHO fanzines for DOCTOR, and the entire fandom held its breath on the new, America-produced DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it became known that the archenemy of Doctor of the Masters would play the Eric Roberts, everyone scratched his head and shouted, "Who is Eric Roberts?". I should point out that this was before the online release of the IMDB. All you had to do was enter a name into this website, but a helpful ghost wrote in a publication for which I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts is best known for a website role in which he works alongside F Murray Abraham starred in the movie BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school. Looking back, Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but that did not stop the person from putting the boot in both Roberts and BY THE SWORD, and he felt that this American champion with its southern flair was going to a debacle. Oddly enough, most fans were furious that Roberts had played the Master, but after seeing the DOCTOR WHO TVM, many fans (including myself) thought that Robert's performance was the best of the disappointing American production. Yeah, I wanted to do something about it, but BY THE SWORD was a movie I really wanted to see because it was the first time that I heard the name Eric Roberts, but until the weekend I had no chance to see it, and me I was pretty disappointed I do not know anything about fencing (Everyone else on this site seems obliged to mention if he fences or not.) I do not fence). So I do not know how that is, but as I said, the film feels anachronistic, even though you've seen it on its release in 1991, the hairstyles seem to be out of date for a few years, along with theirs mixed teens doing a little dance routine that will make you wonder if it would not have worked much better if it had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid-1980s. It could be argued that this would have meant that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard was out of focus for most of the film, but I was not convinced of their love-hate relationship, and Abraham and Roberts have much better before and since BY THE SWORD Services shown
