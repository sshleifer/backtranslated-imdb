ZB1 I really liked. Actually, I did. I have no problem with movies on an extremely low budget, and I've enjoyed movies with lower production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine anything like that, look at 'wiseguys vs. zombies' if you're interested). In fact, I prefer zombie films on a lower budget, as I have to guess that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are all about. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just so bad. It was delayed. I do not want to be worthy of my criticism. I want my 90 minutes back, and so on, except that it really only took ~ 80 minutes, because I pre-loaded it halfway in 1.4X. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's some criticism. <br /> <br /> 1. The pace was terrible. Everyone talked in monologues. Even if someone had only a single line, the camera work and the editing and insertion of a series of F-bombs in each set made the line a monologue. At first, I was upset over the 90-minute period compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but in ZB3, there were actually fewer "events". Everything is talked about. <br /> <br /> 2. The gore effects got dumber. Just glide over the bellies of the people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exhibition, there was really no action. And the exhibition is indeed epic! I will not spoil it, if you will see it. (Do not look at it.) But then there are only a few lame characters running around fighting for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you wish.
