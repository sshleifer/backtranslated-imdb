This movie is another Christian propaganda film in the line of The Omega Code. Not that this is necessarily bad, but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to deliver. If you enjoy a Styrofoam depiction of street life and the way the gospel can change your life, you might enjoy this movie. I say save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that people sometimes speak bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals portrayed who can not swear (what do criminals say?) And flat characters that I really could not handle. It would also have been great if the movie had shown a few T & A's. That would be something I would like to pay to see. Who was the fool who compared this gossamer history of communion with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
