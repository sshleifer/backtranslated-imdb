It is one of the fun things of being young that you can easily be deceived by advertising. I've talked about another movie before, in which the commercial for the (comedy) movie looks funnier than it is. When I saw the ad in 1981, I thought it would be a totally funny movie. What I and my brother who went with me did not know was that the scene used in the television commercial was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that has happened before in the movie, I can only guess that there was nothing funny to use! The last scene, thanks to a youth drink, is dr. Fu Manchu transforms from a long-bearded old man into a bright, young Asian / Elvis rock star! (With back singers no less!) <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers argues for no reason in the 1930s with this material, but he has no really good reason for his "comedy". Moments The rest of the actors were just boring and my brother and I were sitting all the time, barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we expected a comedy of the Pink Panther type. Peter Sellers was so great. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this was his last movie before he died. His appearance in the Muppetshow was more entertaining than this ill-conceived flop. Nevertheless, I do not blame him. I complain to everyone involved that they have not tried to make a better movie. 2 stars will be generous !!
