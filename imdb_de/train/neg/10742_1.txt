I tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago. What a disaster. The spectacle was cruel. There were some absolutely pitiful action scenes, which did not occur as a guide. This was mainly because the actors' reactions were straight. It did not ring properly. Presumably, the Hitchcock original "Lifeboat" rang in a modern way. I think Hictcock would turn circles in his grave at his thought. Exactly what I could suffer from is not compelling movie.it has a few half-name names, but they do not bother with their characters. But to be honest, no one really was to blame. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script exploded on the first explosion. LOL.it it is possible that this thing improves over time. But for me, I'm not ready to spend at least three days figuring it out. So, if you do not have at least a weekend with three days on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
