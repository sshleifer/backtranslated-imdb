That was a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was awfully awkward; I could not feel any sense behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too hastily and felt out of place. They might as well have been quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist and a strange feeling came to an American Rochester. He could at least have tried to put a British accent on it. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but that just did not work. I felt I was seen by Jane Eyre, where the main parts of the story were randomly put together, regardless of the flow of the story. The scenery and the music were all very nice, but I could not feel the passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester, and the movie left me completely unmoved. <br /> <br /> If you want to see one Good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the BBC version from 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these are two brilliant adjustments.
