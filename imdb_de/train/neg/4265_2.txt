I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after seeing Mongol, which is absolutely fantastic and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations for a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, terrible, even miserable in this case is not a strong word. The whole movie was waiting for something exciting to happen, but I did not, then at least I expected a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a big disappointment, just a few random moves that wagged the swords. .. There are so many good warrior films, this one is not one of them.
