In less than 10 minutes, this movie wanted to end because it was painful. This whole "horror movie" was about a bunch of short-haired bitches who did stupid things for 90 minutes arguing, crying and screaming. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews, as this is really a horrible movie and you really should not see it. <br /> <br /> The movie plot has the potential to be a great thing, but it just does not happen. A group of five "teenage" girls drive home one night when they are being chased by a crazy female driver who wants to kill her. Two minutes after the movie, and the characters are already arguing and that does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. None of the dialogues is interesting even remotely, so you do not really get to know or enjoy these characters. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women looked one day under 20 and one of them looked as if she was almost 30 years old. At least get people who look old. Neither of them gave even acceptable appearances, and it seemed they were picked up from the street or were friends of the director without any acting skills. The "actress" who played the killer exaggerated it, but at least she showed something the other girls did not do - a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things because these girls are a bunch of vain, stupid bitches. That's all I really can say about them, and it did not help that they survived ALL. If I have to go into detail, the girls are chased in a scene by the killer and their car is often hit. A girl hurts and complains about it ... four of them do not wear safety belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer ... and you are all just "too hurt" to help? What ever. <br /> <br /> The filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. I do not care if this movie has a budget the size of a peanut, shooting was horrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, was pressed against a window somewhere and the number of times in which the camera was blurred, trembling and turned against an "actress" was terrible. It was also grainy, and sometimes you could not hear what the characters said (not that it was valuable). <br /> <br /> Probably the Killers car in the movie (which was allegedly even hit) though we've just heard the accident) is the director's car in real life. No wonder the car was not hit! This movie is so cheap that they can not even show how a car gets a little scratched. Oh, I have to mention the soundtrack too, if that was it. It was awful ... a second sad, then the next hard rock. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed at night in the middle of the street with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. It does not help if the script is awful, the anxiety / tension / suspense and (hardly a horror to make up for) are missing, the acting is awful and the picture quality and the filming are awful. <br /> This was a terrible low budget movie. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
