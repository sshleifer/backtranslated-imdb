I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was rated 16 in Germany, I entered the film as a relapse. It was so boring. Later, I realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibited his wife. I mean, today you do that over the internet and you pay for instant access. It's been more than 20 years, but I'm still angry that I wasted my time on this movie. This is a soft porn for students. Take off Bo Derek and paint with paint - beautiful. But then they should call the movie "Undressing Bo" and paint it.
