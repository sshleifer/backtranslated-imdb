Especially if you are a fan of comics, you will be very disappointed. Low budget movie !!! Largo is said to be Serbian in the comic, now he is suddenly Croat, pfff! Chicken producers, it gave the comic some spice and courage (By the way, in the film his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The striking N. Y. Winch building becomes an ordinary average small yacht in H.K. The good-looking Largo becomes an unshaven Tzigan / Turkish-looking guy. Freddy, the cool "scarface" pilot, becomes a fat, inappropriate, sad, average guy. Simon, Largo's good buddy, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw knives, but only a few snake looks ... The whole story is confused and looks like a presumptuous TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, skill or technology to properly adapt the comic book, please stick to a romance filmed in Paris. Very bad movie, good that I've just rented it. Do not rely on seeing the sequel (if any!).
