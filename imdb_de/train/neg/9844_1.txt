This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious or just a satire. One of those films that uses all the silly, insane stereotypes they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was really pretty good at it. But otherwise it sucked. I've seen it over 10 years ago, but it still hurts and does not stop me from staying in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I will not ruin it for you if you want to try fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a * nghya * moment in the end, with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do and like to steer, then maybe it's worth it. If you're also forced to arrange a date with someone you really dislike, suggest you watch this movie together, and he'll probably leave you alone after seeing him. That's a fair price, I think.
