This movie may have low production levels, but that's what makes it so good. The special effects are rough and well done. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy, played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard, leader of the gang, is just like the other members, weird. This film is actually trying to say something by saying that nuclear waste facilities are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, great movie.
