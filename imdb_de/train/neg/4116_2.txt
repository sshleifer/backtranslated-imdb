My one-line summary should explain everything, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie seemed like an exaggerated soap opera, and that's all I can say. There were some interesting scenes, like the "Big One" that came in the middle of the movie, but wait, what is that? The earthquake * gasp *, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it were slaughtered and smashed. I can not believe how bad this movie was filmed, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better movies. One wonders what the director thought the viewers are stupid enough to believe that downtown LA has large forested mountainous scenery, including Dante's Peak and the real thing (again someone from Dante's Peak happens to be .) <br /> <br />
