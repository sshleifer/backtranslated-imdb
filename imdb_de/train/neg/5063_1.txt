Terrible movie. It's a shame that some of Flanders's top actors and actresses have done such a lousy bad movie. <br /> <br /> Little has changed since the first film and the TV series: same actors, same prototype characters, same scenario (emotional complications, the team is under emotional pressure, but falls for a predictable finale everything out). Another consistent fact in Jan Verheyen's work is the over-the-top product placement (company logo on the team's jersey and next to OK, but twice a commercial (of one of the characters) is a bit over-the-top via an ISP.) Meanwhile, the rumor has come to make a second series for the Flemish TV station "VTM" (coincidentally or not, the channel where Jan Verheyen has been the program manager for a few months). <br /> <Finally ... and the golden raspberry award for the worst foreign movie goes ...
