Well ... I wanted to wait until the video came out to see it, and I wish I had caught the creepy movie 2 on cable the other day, and I had to long to get more of it was plane on CRACK .. I mean, if you like Airplane or other Leslie Nielsen vehicles then you're probably going to be in the sky, but if you're used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY you'll be disappointed, there was a lot more Eye Candy in this area, which will infuriate young hormones is probably one reason why it was a blockbuster the first week. I had the scary movie 2 ten times more than this food and the first part 5 times as much. Strange that the better part of the 3 part 2 is, but on the other hand, I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original. Maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye. But that was not worth the $ 11 I spent to catch a matinee with my fianc√©. Save money and re-capture Part 2 to cable until it's posted on videotape and rent it, do not buy it.
