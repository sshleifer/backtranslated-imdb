"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition having a bad guy up to his cajons in fast drying concrete. As we wait for the cement to dry and the film to find out what it is all about, we are regularly sent back with no rhyme or reason, so we can watch the events that lead to the cement. "Cement" is a boring scrap film and suffers from a lack of history, a clumsy execution and all the omnipresent mistakes of the film world. no need to worry A time killer for the needy couch potato at best.
