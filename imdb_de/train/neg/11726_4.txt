Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin, agent of the CIA and a pure specialist. In his free time, Dial bred a cowboy hat and bred horses with macho names like Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Agent Collins, his senior officer. Enter a new task - kill a terrorist detained in the UK. Of course, as an allied state, the UK is a great place for covert operations and headshots outside of courtrooms. <br /> <br /> The murder is a great success, apart from the fact that the escape plan has blown. Dial's partner and his local contact are killed trying to escape the police, and Dial becomes a hotbed of London's copper trying to reach him and the CIA trying to eliminate him. Fortunately, Dial the Safe House is regularly visited by a teenage girl, Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and helping them escape from the evil British law enforcement agencies using a script like this one say more? On the plus side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be it a pro or a cheater) and the movie is pretty captivating. Minus editing is very incoherent and has an effect on the stomach.
