WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should worry about it, and apologize for the caps.) Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice, which is all the more annoying when you talk nonsense, it continues with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That's bad, but exactly. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complicated system with a lot of potential for dysfunction, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc., and unexpected events can happen in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, the stuff went wrong. It's called learning. Admittedly, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Various bugs / comments I did not even have to look up to: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon was preparing a speech in case something went wrong. Well, you are. I would have done that. After all, it was the culmination of a propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives the green light, though Appollo 11 is likely to blow up. (However, this is "only" implicit.) Yes, so they let the people and the print shop watch almost in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) The capsule ejection would not work. As if it did not work when a chimpanzee was in it. The survivor? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) An interviewed guy says an explosion wiped out a good part of Florida. I can only assume that it was an exaggeration, because if not, I'm just horrified how he could do it so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was primitive at the time compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware is still used today because it should not crash. For spacecraft, it's even worse because their computers have to be made up of relatively large components that are not as sensitive to radiation. (And the boat itself has to be manually maneuverable anyway, so a complex control system like the B2 would not work.) What about the fact that they used "TV screens" instead of "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, television monitors have been and are being produced at a much higher resolution. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object were not part of the rocket, it could only be one thing." We see where that leads. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not a rocket roll? At least one interviewee explains that if a thing is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) The voice over as well as some false quotes it seems like the lander's radiator film is actually the hull. What would make it thinner than a space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's nearly death during an exercise flight is stuff I can appreciate; I had not seen it before. As I said earlier, any obvious technology can go wrong, especially if it has not been tested enough to have never been there before. <br /> <br /> 9) The deviation of the trajectory of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the density of the moon) has never been acutely life-threatening. Even the "fifteen seconds of fuel" was still "fifteen seconds of fuel" before the mission had to be aborted and returned to the command module. <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophe" chain of events "usually leads to disaster, I really do not know how to phrase it more easily, but this is an excellent example of the rhetoric used." br /> <br /> 11) There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and jumping aimlessly like a happy kid, followed by the voice telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed It turns out that he walks around and jumps aimlessly like a merry boy, hilarious stuff. <br /> <br /> 12) It's mentioned that all contact was lost during reentry, which is a completely natural one Phenomenon and was so well known at the time that it can not be circumvented with modern technology.Also, the severity of the problem is implicit, but very deliberate. <br /> <br /> 13) In space itself, a shuttle was never lost gegang while the voice-over illustrates this "fact" as proof that Appollo 11 was a bunch of crap. Appollo 13 was almost lost, but the two real disasters occurred when taking off or re-entering. In any case, the comparison of shuttles with Saturn rockets somehow ... well, just stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to have been of no interest to the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) What's wrong with the UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. If you do not believe that it was made for entertainment purposes and addressed to a specific audience (including those with little understanding of history, science, or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the meaning of the movie is a bit dark. Catch phrases like "Till now hidden," "revealed here for the first time" are coming up, but the movie does not blame or lecture, or anything that could be expected from such an emotional film. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recordings of fragments that are often unrelated to humans, and of which we know nothing except "NASA scientists." Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous about the venture? Imagine. What does that have to do with the meaning of the film? Oh yes, which point. To summarize, it is not just deliberately or incompetently inaccurate, it does not even provide good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries. This movie is not funny, funny, funny, nothing.
