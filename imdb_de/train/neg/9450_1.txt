Spend your time in a different way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the funny rhymes dr. Seus are are not there. A very bad way to waste an evening. My children 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning. The younger ones were bored boring to play Barbies, and the elders had to play PS2 and surf the net. My wife went and washed. So I ended it alone. It was the worst "kids movie" I've ever seen. If you want to see a funny kids movie watching Shrek 2, this movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, not cute, the make-up of the cat is the only good thing you can see on the label of the CD.
