That's the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever produced. I was a kid when this came out, and I still thought it was Deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon. There is one scene that I remember when the Mafia monkey man explains to his henchmen what rhetorical questions there are. It is cruel. Many fans hate the series for shooting a female turtle, but that did not bother me. So much so that I did not remember her until I recently read about the show. All in all, it is unfortunately an unforgettable experience. <br /> <br /> The only okay was the theme song. Guilty pleasure they call it ... Nananana Ninja ...
