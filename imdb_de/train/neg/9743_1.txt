This line begins a stupid, boring British science-fiction movie. The Big Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation machine just to cut it off by Blanchard, a bearded man who has something for fly and men with big eyebrows. If his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the scholarships in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself into the house of Blanchard with the help of his lab assistant Sheila. Needless to say, something goes wrong and he looks like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to the well-orange doctor walking around in London, shocking people with his mutant hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are more killings, modest paperwork, and eventually the doctor disappears where rat faces get. Luckily no one decided on a sequel.
