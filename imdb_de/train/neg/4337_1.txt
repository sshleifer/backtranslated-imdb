This is just a slaughter of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the plot in the book. And there are so many discrepancies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the writer has ever seen the first movie. Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) comes from prison the beginning of the original. Here Carlito retires with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this episode she is not mentioned, and Carlito retreats and will probably marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. He was Pachanga in the Pacino days. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes played a much bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where does Sean Comb's character come from? I also think that this film really glosses over the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres wrote about. And the mob does not get the treatment he did in the book. They are also wiped out in this movie. Magical is the Pleasant Avenue bunch for the second film. <br /> <br /> The book told a great story. This movie could have told a great story. This is just a big disappointment. Read the book. It's a better use of your time.
