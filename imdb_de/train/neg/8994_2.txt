This film is a prime example of the waste of large resources in a movie. They have future SNL and SCTV stars such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Joe Flaherty, who essentially make 70 minutes of crude, uninspired fart and racist jokes. The concept of a network of the future infiltrating society could really have gotten into some interesting extremes, but right in front of the gate makes a lame, youthful proctology joke and in that sense of humor all the way stays a lot of subversive and funny groove tube or the hilarious one Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is for those who want to see a time capsule of 70s sketch comedy movies.
