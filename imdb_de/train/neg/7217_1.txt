I have just seen this DVD at home. We love Western, so my husband rented it. He began to apologize halfway to me. The saddles, costumes, accents - everything was over. The part that drove me so crazy is that the guy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow when he took the fat guy's soul. His only apology was "he only had 2 arrows left." We've gone all the way through it, and as someone else has said ... too many bad things to find any reason why it was shitty. I mean, the fact that the boy accidentally tore the bad stone from the collector the same month and the same day he was found, what's the point? And why was there a cemetery where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector are still walking around? If you want a movie to make fun after a few beers, this could be your movie. However, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.
