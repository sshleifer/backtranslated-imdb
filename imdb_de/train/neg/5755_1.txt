I also saw this movie at the New York High Falls Film Festival show, and I have to say that I found it completely and terribly boring. Although it was funny in some places, the only true laugh was that there did not seem to be a real plan to talk about, and that in some places the play was awful and wooden, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the voice of the Narrator (who I had never heard of) had a lot to be desired. I thought that J.C.Mac was the redeeming feature of this movie, true action and sand, and (beyond cast) the only real spectacle. I'm sure, with another cast and directing, this could have been a decent movie. Let's hope that it will not be sent out in the general publication, or if you really want a copy, look in the trash can in Lidl.
