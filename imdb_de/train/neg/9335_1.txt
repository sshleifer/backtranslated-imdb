The reason this film is so bad is because it was written so poorly. This is entirely the fault of hack and writer Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is completely banal and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couple, a blocked American writer, and a pretty Mexican woman whose story is ashamed are swept away by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few (usually horribly violent) adventures take turns showing scenes of the assassin's warmer side, she leaves the powerless partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone else. Nothing can make this film a success, not even the mingled face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the engaging Latinity of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz and not even the convincing performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist to track down the killer. A serious waste of time.
