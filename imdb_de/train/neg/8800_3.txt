A collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes, edited together and provided with voice-over to make them appear after the first events. Pretty cool idea, but deleted scenes stay on the ground of tailoring for a reason and this is further proof. Since it's just not as funny as "Anchorman" and let's be honest that the movie was not a comedy gold either, so you get a "movie" that's worse than a movie that was moderately funny. In my eyes, that STILL has one or two notches about "Kicking and Screaming" or "Charmed". Your fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to the old school form (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My degree: D
