*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teen slasher movies suffer from a drought of originality? It seems awful. First of all, this is a noble premise that could be well utilized. A rejected young nerd who grows up stealing and murdering all the girls who tortured him in junior high school? I can not say that you did not have anything to work with. However, this movie makes the same moves as all the other Slashers of recent times. Everything, from the score to the camera angles, lets us predict exactly when a false alarm will be triggered and when the killer will beat. We know the pattern now. These stupid slasher movies are driving credibility more and more by the minute. May I ask you something: who, in the right shape, will surprise a friend in the middle of the night in a dark, bleak morgue and surprise her out of the blue while she is all alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any sense at all? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. A good shot involves slaughtering Denise Richards' character. She is caught in a pool and the killer nudges her with a chainsaw. The soundtrack contains some good songs, including a cool track from Orgy. The music video is included in the special features of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the spectacle is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal as a title character on "Angel." Denise Richards is a good actress, and she has a stonemason throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is exactly what you would expect: presumptuous, implausible, forgetful, cheesy and without much fear. Do not bother. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 (out of 10)
