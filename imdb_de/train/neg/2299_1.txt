Before I start ... let me say that I absolutely believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, now this is out of the way, I just want to say, what on earth do these idiots who call themselves "hosts" think? The last time I check a host, he does not discriminate, spits hate-filled rages on television, or tries to plunge his own beliefs into any unfortunate soul venturing into the Channel. All those crazy, idiotic, conservative, and loitering Bible populations that Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson does every day. I'm all for free speech, but since when does that refer to a man who quite often says that when you dare to live your ideal way of life, you're immediately sent to hell. This is just a perfect example of why religion causes so many problems at SOOOO. One day we had a substitute teacher in my classroom, so we decided to watch some TV because the class did not give us a job. And we (against many of us) watched the club of 700, and of course that idiot patted and scolded Pat about the Bible, and he said Simon in the sense of "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a child "Hmm, I think he's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to get people to believe that someone else's sexual orientation is a big sin, then they have to take the host seriously, tape them, and drop them off a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
