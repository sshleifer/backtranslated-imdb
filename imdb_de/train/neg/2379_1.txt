I admit I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman in the world and has made it her mission to see every movie she's in (including, unfortunately, the terrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> this must be the worst movie I have ever seen. (Yes, it's even lower than The Avengers). Everyone looks lost in it and it is unmistakable. <br /> <br /> Even though you think that Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE do not go into this movie. They will hate each other the next morning.
