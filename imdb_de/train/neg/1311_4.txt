Jerry spies on Tom, who hears a scary story on the radio, and takes the opportunity to frighten his archenemy. <br /> <br /> I did not find this episode particularly funny: The humor seemed to be quite limited and it was all a bit lame (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this case, the poor Tom from any particular one Reason torments). <br /> <br /> There is occasionally an impulse of inspiration (like Tom's literal "heart-in-mouth" experience and the moment his nines are living being sucked out of his body), but by and large he lacks it Effort the frenetic tempo, the excellent animations and the sheer joke of most other T & J cartoons
