What starts out to be a pretty shrewd farce about a somewhat dodgy security surveillance company almost instantly turns into an uninteresting and completely meaningless murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to make this move shaky, but some things just are not humanly possible. For example, what causes Gale to suddenly change from a sweet maternal figure to a sweet maternal figure, a drunken shrew at Tommy's childhood home? Why should Henry, though admittedly a sleeping bag, destroy the business to which he dedicates his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does the seemingly reasonable Tommy believe that Henry could be a murderer (almost entirely based on a dream), and even if that were credible, why not go to the police? And why did not Gale sound the alarm when she got home, especially after telling Howie he was off? Of course, all these events are necessary to unfold the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely). And it could be forgivable if it results in even the smallest bit of comedy. But everything from Howie's description of his rape to the misidentification of the coroner of Gale, to the final "joke" about Gale and Howie still being dead, is tastier and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I Check the box to indicate that my comments contained "spoilers", but there's nothing left that I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing already in heaven smells bad.
