I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Here in Latin America, Japanese films or oriental films have no distribution in cinemas. We can find some of these films in some underground stores and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something good, but the only good thing about this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and pointless, just stupid, with many useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time even writing about this movie. Sorry, that's the truth.
