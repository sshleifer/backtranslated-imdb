Can you say "all shock, no conspiracy?" There were so many unexplored directions in this film. There was no story about the room except the deaths. * WHY * was it evil? What did it do? Why an "hour" countdown? Then the unexplored things were hinted at; For example, we saw a camera in the air damper that he mentioned. But when he climbed, he said, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How about the fact that all ghosts looked "digital" and things "disappeared" before they hit the ground and made a static noise? Hmmm ... putting all these * things together makes room 1408 look like a hi-tech haunted house. Apart from the fact that there was no follow-up. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... Electronics does not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the phone has no signal, but wireless works fine. How many incontinances can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing but "shock after shock". Everything has been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just outside the site. Change the painting. Walls bleed. The "Oh, it was all just a dream ... no, that was not it." And if the room was "evil," why would our main character arrange for the death of his daughter if he were trapped there anyway? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> There was also no background information about "The First Book" he wrote. Only some vague information about the "father was a jerk" and so on. Speaking of fathers, what about his father? "They will be in my place". <br /> <br /> All in all a really HORRIBLE movie. It was a 100% adrenalin shock factor, with no new or innovative effects, and certainly no backstory, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the entire movie was made "cheap". pretty much a set and a few location shots, and it was nothing but an effect film made from recycled, cheesy, "anticipated" effects.
