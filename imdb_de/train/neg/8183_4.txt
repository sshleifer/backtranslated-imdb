This is a pretty tame fluff piece about breaking World War II codes, stealing them, etc. The show is about what I expected from this cast of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> A big caution. Jean Rogers, who played the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two series of Flash Gordon, is just awful in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. She absolutely never gives up on her exaggerated behavior. We're supposed to believe that during the World War she could get in and out of any office of her choice in an apparently top secret code facility, even though she has no official function. From that point of view, I'm sorry I've ever seen this movie. That changed my perception of Ms. Rogers forever. Talent wise she is an extreme lightweight. Lee Bowman is his ordinary self, which means that he is only appropriate. <br /> <br />
