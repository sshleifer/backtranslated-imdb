Take a sci-fi original movie and mix in a little alternative / revisionist story to get "Aztec Rex". Apparently, before he conquered the Aztec empire, Hernand Cortes first had to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and its partner. That's the core of this movie. Given the plot it would have really sucked; the fact that it is only somehow sucked is a bit of a cap for the writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is as compelling as Axl Rose, who plays Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs seem to be played here by an exclusively Hawaiian ensemble. Besides, the T-Rex (es) look reasonably good, though every time one of them was shot, CGI just leaked out. And they die too easily; I think if a T-Rex were close in real life, they could probably be lulled or at least wounded by some rudimentary 16th century weapons. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-Schluckmen-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There is plenty of action, and the entire colonization angle is prevalent throughout the area, but does not overcome the dinosaur angle, unlike the other sci-fi original dinosaur movies "Warbirds". Overall, a mediocre (but decent after SciFi standards standards) film that rated a modest 4.
