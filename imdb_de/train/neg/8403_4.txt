I have only edited these four out of their historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it emerged from nowhere on Showtime in the early 1990s. Moe is the hetero and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a few numbers. I think it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not sure because the plot was so minimal that I do not really remember anything. I vaguely remember that it was a western music comedy. Even the Stooges seem to go through the movements. Overall, there is not really much to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan, do not bother. If you're a fan of Stooge, stay with the shorts.
