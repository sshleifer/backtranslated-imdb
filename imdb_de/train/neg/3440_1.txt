Never watch this movie ... it's the biggest bunch I've ever encountered in my life. and that says something. The acting, the plot and the filming were absolutely dark. This is the worst movie in the world !!! Seriously, is not it even a hit as it cost my 99p from sainsburys and was only made in 2005? hahaha, this movie is like a cheap college movie, you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen ... though, if you really want to see it, you have to see the "spooky shark scene" ... maybe that best piece of drama I've seen in my life ... ha ha. I seriously, this is the biggest drop of 2 1/2 hours I've ever had !!
