I have to congratulate the genius who has approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think buddy, you can not endorse every piece of amateur stuff is bad and I mean bad. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. <br /> <br /> Acting, let's just say: Do not go to the supermarket and look for actors. The good guys usually come with a degree or at least have a damned experience! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director just suck. Their direction is bad, the angles are all mixed up (not in a good way), the lines seem like they're being read from toilet paper, and the damn music goes away for no apparent reason. By the way, not for writers. Creating movies is not like serving on a coffee shop, but requires art and skill. Things that I really doubt you will ever have forgotten and wait until something good came up .. Or just find a job on a coffee shop. They have less stress and save the moviegoers some money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (my first)
