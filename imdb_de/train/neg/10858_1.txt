I did not know if I would laugh or cry when I saw that. Only addicted fans of Danni dirt could taste it. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but it's just filth. The coolest scene is the car accident, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this just for studies of how bad a movie can be ................
