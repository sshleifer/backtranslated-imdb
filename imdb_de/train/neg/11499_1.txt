Gadar is a really stupid movie because he tells a fake story. He is too unrealistic and is a typical sunny Deol movie aiming to beat Pakistan. The film is meant to mislead viewers into thinking that Pakistan and its government are bad. Trying to hide their own mistakes does not work. And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad. The Sikhs will probably love the movie very much because they are misguided. The movie sucks and sucks with power. I think only Amisha Patel was good at the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, but I would be the lowest 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not look at this stupid boring movie.
