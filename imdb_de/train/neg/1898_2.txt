The remake of H.B. Halicki's classic 70s chase movie is just awful. Together with Vanishing Point Gone represent the epitome of chases in 60 Seconds. The remake takes the original and turns it upside down. While Halicki gave us 75% chase and 25% drama, in GISS 2000 we have 25% chase and 75% drama. Cage as Superman, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least, Halicki saw nothing more when he saw that his baby (he was writing, producing, directing and starring in the '74 movie) was demoted this way.
