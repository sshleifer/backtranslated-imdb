This movie was miserable. and not in the good way, as some have claimed. First of all, the main character is a very unsightly Gingerman. Second - WTF continues with this van love. The plot is essentially: boy wants sex and buys a van (which is pretty cool in fairness). Unbelievable that he looks like a newt, he scores with many chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realizes that he loves this stupid bird, which is hard to come by. Then he drags race with the hot-chick friend. And he tilts with his van. At this point danny devito saves the day. Although he did not need it, because the Gingerkind had first crossed the line when the delivery truck toppled over. I gave this 2 * because I'm ready to assume that there's a sort of Vanning subculture of the 70's that I do not get, and also because there's a 70's boat as well.
