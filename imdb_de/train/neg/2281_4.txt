Think of "play". This is unique for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. COmpare the Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with the Melvyn DOuglas of this movie. Are there any vampires in this Bavarian village, or is there a more natural, if equally eerie, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring cast as a particularly moronic character. It's fun to look at his different facial expressions in a truly distinctive character. It does not happen for a long time, but then we discover that Atwills pipe smoker is the real killer. There is too much "comic relief", but that is obvious for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
