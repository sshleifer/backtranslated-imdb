Another British romantic comedy for which audiences around the world have a great appetite. This faint effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all classic clich√© scenes range from ridiculously elaborated misunderstandings to running after leaving the moves to declare love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, except for Love-Hewitt, who manages to give the film a sense of cohesion. Things threaten to get out of hand in the plausibility department as the film progresses; our good-natured suspension of faith finally comes together during the absurd end. If you are looking for an experience from Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, you will not find them here.
