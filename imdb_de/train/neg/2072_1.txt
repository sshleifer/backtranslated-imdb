I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a funny movie. I figured that with a concept of ex-girlfriend with superpowers, you really can not go wrong. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confused and pointless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed like the writer was throwing scrap at every opportunity. The writer also continued to throw lots of toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenager could love. <br /> <br /> It seems so easy to draw a story from the Fatal Attraction superhero. But I do not think. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy for which it was announced. You could not bring a child with you and you would be embarrassed if you saw a date. <br /> <br /> If the author could have made a basic story about the high concept and cleaned it up - the film could have a chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
