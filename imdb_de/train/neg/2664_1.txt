An awkward, clich√©d thriller gets a young couple across countries to research the most notorious murderous places in America and becomes a street partner with a sloppy young woman and her growling friend - who is a real psycho. Arty and alienating, the sound of the film changes between sulky pseudo-irony and stupid flamboyance. Maybe nicely done, but ultimately ridiculous. The performance of Brad Pitt as a low-rent killer is unbelievable. * from ****
