This is part of the infamous Guinea Pig series. A short-lived Japanese TV show that was canceled after a psychopath found inspiration for the murder of a young schoolgirl. Like all the other films in the series, this short film in the series is virtually without any history. A group of men captured a young woman. They tie them up and torture them to death while they film them. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use a pair of pliers and finally, in a "loving" close-up, push a needle through her eye. This is the most uncomplicated of all Guinea Pig films and one of the first. It was probably more than any other movie that had Guinea Pig rumored to be snuff. You have certainly inspired Nicolas Cage's film "8mm". These films have become very popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished but also graphic films like "Naked Blood". They're probably filling the gap left by the Mondo movies, which have been cleaned up and turned into reality TV. Not recommended, but will probably inspire those who will see something, and wonder why I know about it.
