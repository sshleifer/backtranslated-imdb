I'd rather go through 20 root canals than this movie again. The Prince of the Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. The only amusing thing in this whole mess is Mr. Samaha's repugnant camera shit over tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust. It's choppy and badly made to look seemingly nervous or funny. It is neither. I rarely get the feeling that a movie was a waste of film (or band), but this movie lends itself to this distinction. If a date suggests seeing this movie, run it.
