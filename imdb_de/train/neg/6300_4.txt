This seemed like a weird combination of Withnail and myself with A Room with a View .. sometimes it worked, sometimes not. Tragedy that they have changed the name for the US release. Keep the Apidistra Flying is much better than the non-name A Merry War. Acting was okay, script was okay .. overall it was a mediocre movie ..
