This film has potential, but what really makes it bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen them in anything else before and maybe there are some Crouse fans who like them in something else, but their performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Your delivery is robot. As she delivered her lines, she seemed to make sure that she had the lines right and just read the list in her head. So your voice has very little flexion. I can not believe that someone so bad at acting has been given a starring role in a movie. She has to know someone in the business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate having them in common, but the comment needs to be "this" long and their performance is what stands out more than anything else. <br /> But I liked that where the story went, so I kept looking at it. The first part of the script has the requirements for a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. If her acting would have been better, I would have liked it.
