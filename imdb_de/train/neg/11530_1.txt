For the last 10 years, I've worked in 3 different professional indie wrestling organizations, led many professional wrestlers (including 2 backyard wrestling stars), worked on two different wrestling TV programs, voice overs, and commentaries on many wrestling -DVDs made. I have NEVER witnessed how much amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skill and inferior production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To list this even as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an absolute misuse of the term. Recorded with low-dollar video cameras, these are essentially home videos in which children fight in backyards. The sound quality is poor, the video quality is poor and the spectacle is horrible. The "wrestlers" wear temporary costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks. They meet with a variety of items and imitate halfway wrestling moves. Sometimes the "matches" are in the meadow. Sometimes on a backyard trampoline. All are badly played and executed without any wrestling skills. In short, do not bother about that stinker. Whether you are interested in this DVD or you are interested in this DVD (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
