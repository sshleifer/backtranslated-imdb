What a fucking movie that was! I can not understand what people on "The Grudge" find so scary. The director plays a trick (I have to admit a very good one that comes to life very stylized) and then repeats it over and over for the rest of the movie. As a consequence, I got a little scared a couple of times in the first quarter of the movie, but when I knew the exercise, I practically fell asleep as The Grudge became more predictable by the minute. In summary, I can say that there are much better films in the genre, that the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was much scarier and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
