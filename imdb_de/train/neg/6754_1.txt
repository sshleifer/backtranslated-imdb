The only reason I bother to comment on this movie is to take a chance every 97 minutes of your life and possibly your money. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of switching on, I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast was to be kept until winter and then thrown to the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their kind shot, unfortunately this should have happened before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it run away in the shops. <br /> <br /> 1/10
