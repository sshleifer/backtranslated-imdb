A very good story for a movie that, if done right, would be interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? The scenes are going so fast that you feel like you are not emotionally involved in the film, and the feeling that you are decoupling from understanding the plot is believable. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
