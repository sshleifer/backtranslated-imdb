Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-season episode (episdoe K-20) is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, comb out the worst cinematography of all time and deliver lines written by a secret working group in the style of Dick Cheney, which consists of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to get the Shorten mass for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly Super 8. Let Logan's Run look like the Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine seeing it without the comment from Crow and Servo, as it can not be beaten even with him. What is really needed in Hollywood is a kind of 401K that saves actors from including bad movies like these to pay for their health care. In the end, with the theme "Right to Pollution and Driving," I expect half of a Charlton Heston cameo to be "cold, dead hands." Lee, I could have forgiven you that in 1989, but in 1981?
