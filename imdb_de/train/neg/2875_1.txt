This is the biggest crap ever. It looks like they spent more time, effort and money on the DVD cover than on the actual movie. I really thought that the DVD had been replaced with a homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This movie looks like someone with a hundred bucks and a camcorder made it and spent half of it on rats. The picture is really clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, the cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that's what they're doing, and scripts, if they had one, leave that one Movie look worse than an old porn. At least the old porn has a point. It looks like some PETA members have teamed up and decided to make a really disturbing, meaningless PPE about the rights and feelings of the animals. So that's not worth the money or time. It has nothing to do with the actual BTK serial killer except the name of the killer and the name of some victims. The people who made this movie should be glad that he is not still free, or he might have come after just because he made this movie so bad.
