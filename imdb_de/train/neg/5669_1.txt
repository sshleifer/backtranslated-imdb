The director, armed with chains and leather, warned the audience on Friday evening of the SF Frameline Film Festival about an "adventure film". Experimental? Leave the video camera in the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and cut it in sight of all the senseless dirt. A meandering pastiche road show manqu√© that starts nowhere and gives the audience no place. The non-violent violence that opened the film has driven more than one patron from the Castro Theater. I would have left, too, but my Cine-Buddy had to be driven home and has the feeling that the worse Merde comes through to the end. When the lights came on, the audience had become very thin. Lauwiger applause Pro forma questions of the director, who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
