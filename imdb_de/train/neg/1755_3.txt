This movie is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too focused on the leads. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her overall screen time, but she overeats the rest of the cast too much. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overloading of the clich√© script The daughter secretly leaving college, an elderly woman who finds it difficult to get a good job (and ends up with a pretty humiliating job) , the sloppy network manager with his executives opting for a glamorous fabric, the journalist clinging to their beliefs, etc. There's nothing really wrong about any of these, meaning they're all firmly rooted in reality, but in Combination, they are just too much and leave us too much deja-vu and too few surprises.
