What a load of left Hollywood bilge. This film glorifies mutiny as courageous and noble when it comes to pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with the pacifist figure, played by Danzel Washington, who was actually promoted for his betrayal. What's up with these Hollywood tools? Is that still a reward for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I sound cynical, it's because I'm fed up with having films that plague a political agenda. The military brass in this movie is presented as, what else? Gung-ho warmongers. Sounds familiar? Do you ever see a movie in which the CIA or a government agency is not angry? Think about it. Once again Crimson Tide points out the point. The hackman character, Submarine Captain Ramsey, looks like an avid madman until, in the end, when he comes to his senses, he does a full 360 series, renouncing his bloodlust and proposing a promotion for the treacherous Ron Hunter and repents by retiring from service. A man mutinies, takes control of your boat, puts the US in danger of receiving a nuclear first strike, and you carry him. What a hogwash!
