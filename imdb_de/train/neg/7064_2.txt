"John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I pondered after reviewing the movie information on IMDb late Saturday night after seeing the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished it and unfortunately it was downhill there. You can not spoil a movie that bad, but I'll let the spoilers out of this report ... <br /> <br /> There's a lot of style about little substance: Unfortunately, the style has not been this in the eight years since it's been released Publication too well dated. In terms of substance, through the microcosm of school life, the film seeks to take an interesting look at the nature of control in society; However, under the gleaming veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument does not come into effect. Characters are painted with childish broad strokes and fall into the kind of generic stereotypes that the father of the writer at the Breakfast Club wanted to question. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job and keeps up the pace (maybe he relies too much on montages of information that will soon become an annoying device, but at least fuel the story), but his Efforts Do not be distracted enough by the bad writing and the bizarre casting (how anybody should be content with 'Maddox', as Blake Shields growls through the roll and becomes dull, I can not understand), not to mention the numerous gaffs Plot holes (I'm all for creative licenses, but if the "bad guys" know the identities of the "good guys" that make their lives a misery but do not act in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why This script was not reworked before production - did Daddy even read it?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger crowd will enjoy this movie (and all the power to do it), but you're better off staying with Hughes Sr.'s high school performance, and when the idea of ​​a rebellion in school is the real y appeals, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying study of the subject.
