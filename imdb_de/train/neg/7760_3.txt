In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to an opening party of his facility, consisting of a hotel and a zoo, looking for partners for his discoveries. If a bunch of college small-time thieves put a virus in the security system to attend a scavenger hunt, the zoo's biggest attractions? sabretoothes from the prehistoric era developed from DNA found in fossil ?? Escape, kill the hosts and guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. The characters are terrible and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park rip-off with a bad clich√© collection. Basically, all lines and situations are bad and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretooths are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The attack of Sabretooth")
