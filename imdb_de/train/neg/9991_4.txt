First of all, I'm not here to watch this movie. I find it absolutely pleasant despite the poor production quality. The action here is about as disgusting as the monster pursuing it, even though the monster itself is pretty well done ... impressively well done. He actually looks a bit different, as if a strange family had landed on vacation in the Himalayas, and while dad took a ... visit to the call of nature, Spot broke up and they simply had no time to hunt him. That, or he's the Wishmaster's Caucasian brother. I did not decide which. <br /> <br /> Actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in the snow country, yes, but more likely somewhere in Canada than in China. The trees and the vistas say Canada to me, and it's okay that the environment never takes on the look or feel of overcooling that you would expect in the Himalayas of China. It's a sci-fi channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Also traveling (as we just stated) is that sci-fi directors do not travel often because they are unaware of it. Commercial aircraft fly above the weather like what is described here and the subsequent crash would not have happened. But like I said, it's a sci-fi channel movie, so we have to forgive a few things. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes quite graphic and turns between "Alive" to the Thunder Party "Predator". about the alien in the forest and every bad Wushu movie in which they fly on wires. The Yeti can seem to jump around like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... do you remember? "Run faster, jump higher, live longer!" <br /> <br /> Even the Yeti has missed his teddy bear. He searched high and low, but does not seem to have a carcass. Poor yeti! You can not help but feel sorry. It has survived and evolved thousands of years ago, only to succumb to heavy teddy bears. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but that thought is FORBIDDEN! Do you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unpaired man. REBANIAN <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's a super-yeti! But what is normal-yeti? I do not know, but it has a clear Michael Meyers quality, which is completely disturbing. And he has this fantastic way to cleanse his coat. FABulous Dahlink! It is immaculately white if it is not. He is crazy superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was a lot of fun to watch, has some great kills and some honest plot elements. Despite the awful gritty production style, this is actually very entertaining. I can not be surprised if you plan another one? <br /> <br /> It is rated 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> It gets 4,4 / 10 on the movie scale of ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend.
