These writings write about the end of the plot, so do not read it if you have not seen this junk. <br /> <br /> I found this garbage movie in the horror area, which made me decide that it was a horror. If I own a video library, I would put it in the BORING area. This movie is such a nonsense that you feel like you have lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This film contains endless shots of people driving as if it were scary. Well, I go to work and back almost every day (and sometimes to the store or to my cats) and trust that it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes driving some people. Even the little kid does it too. He walks round and round and he never stops. What is so scary to watch a little child riding an bike for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you see it, you will not think too. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives in a large castle and they get a tour, walking around endlessly and looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around for an hour trying to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see, it's garbage.
