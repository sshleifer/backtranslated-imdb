I do not like using the word "terrible" to describe any work of cinema that puts a lot of time, effort, talent and money into the making, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel "Jane Eyre" is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The script lacks finesse and power, everything explains the viewer indefinitely and leaves little room for imagination. The main characters are insanely miscast, clearly set for their star names, and the music score is drippy and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have no chemistry at all. She's like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who had at least some emotional involvement in a frustrated passion. And William Hurt plays the whole movie with a sound, and that sound is flat and without energy. Of course, the slack and gritty script does not help any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to add a touch of life to the film. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax by Joan Plowright is like a Disney creation that keeps popping up scenes where it would have been best left out. <br /> <br /> There's no secret to the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the would-be second wife, played by Elle MacPhearson like a Barbie doll, is an empty cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed. She would have been better off as Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved teacher, evokes any authentic compassion or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after seeing Robert Young's for British television (1997) with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. The vital, romantic and deeply moving version of Young is like an exploding Nova compared to Zefferelli's wet Squib. <br /> <br /> I will now be interested to see the 1970s version with Timothy Dalton, about which I have read very well things on this site. I'm amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> Above all, what I can say well about this movie is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography is vividly colored, moreover it is a complete guy.
