This is a beautiful, deep cast, but for a thriller you are delivering more than a name actor and talking. The first third of this film consisted of talks and more conversations. Most of them were a few women complaining about everything. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women, so it turns out that this is really a "chick movie". This is probably in the Lifetime Network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. Halfway they had lost me. By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old.
