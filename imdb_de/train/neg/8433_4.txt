Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels completely empty and decides to get drunk. When he returns home, he crashes with a girl who advertises. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and begins to obsessively follow her. Well, the beginning of the movie is a bit slow and can get boring for most people. However, when the action starts, it's a little bit better (not much!). Best of all, maybe the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes above) that you can see in the middle of the movie. This is not good for eroticism, but for the funny and the unexpected, this is the scene. It's probably the best of the movie. Neither the actors nor the director are good, and the result is a boring movie that may be funny to some people (not the whole movie is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the movie says) that have something interesting.) I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best movies (maybe his worst!)), He knows better.
