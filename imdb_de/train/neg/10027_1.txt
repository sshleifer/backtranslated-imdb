The action in this movie beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owns the superpowers Leonidus in the year 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is strange. Apart from the typical comedy of Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor I can not see anything positive in this movie. The story looks like the writer is telling his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoor's long shot shooting with a shotgun is the director's slightest mistake. With the exception of directors Tashan, who shoot this film, there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb, or I would give it a zero.
