First of all, the title character is not even the main character of the film. He is the buddy of the cult leader. The actor portraying Igor believed that loud screaming, hysterical laughter, and a wry smile at the eyeball of the eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of screaming in a high voice (because he had never actually spoken). He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when the cult leader saw one of his followers humming, Igor saw, when he saw this, "Paul, no Paul, why did you do it, I could have cut it clean, so clean!" In another scene, Igor tells a victim she needs to "get her own tooling for the operation because it's time to operate." Apart from the bad acting, the end made no sense, as the story brings some steam to the climax, namely to bring a crossbow arrow to the head and kill the rest of his crazy buddies, he appears two more times to the remaining " Good "to kill. The film does not explain why, just telling the viewer that Igor fled the mental hospital. What??? Conclusion: Do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could get back those moments when I did not see it all again.
