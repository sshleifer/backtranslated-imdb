First, I'm not afraid of ... Everything except my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely terrible. This is not suitable for children at all! I had my mouth open all the time, it just shocked me. I could not believe how bloody it was for a children's movie, rabbits were brutally murdered! It is simply unnecessary to be so terrible and to be rated G. I recommend to be over 8 years old to see this. But do not get me wrong. It was probably a good movie when I was not mentally drawn as a child. I can not believe that a parent would allow a four-year-old child to observe this. It's just too intense and complicated not to forget young people. I'm over 4 and am shocked by the violence. I do not recommend it
