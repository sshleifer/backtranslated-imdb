The film had some good acting and good moments (although obviously a pretty small budget), but poor ratings as the basic requirements were poorly developed. The main conflict between the two ports is not realistic. There are a few scenes in which they do not agree, but no profound discussions that would explain how they can be together when they see the world so different, especially since Glenn is so busy in this part of his life (and Adam is so active that he supports it with time and money.) In addition, Glenn is repeatedly portrayed negatively because he is the way he is (apologizes to Adam for his past), while Adam is shown to be sincere and "traditional I do not like being preached, I attended a briefing session with the director after watching LTR, and he said that he had this conflict between them because if he were in Glenn's shoes (and he said that in real life he is referring to Glenn's point of view), he could never meet anyone with Adams views. Well, I think he should have worked a lot better, to explain how Glenn could make it in the movie. The director also said that he made this first movie after he had read (directed by Dummies). Director was not so bad, but far from a first-class effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely let movies get so frustrated.
