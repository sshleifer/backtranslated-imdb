Rob Schneider is a famous comedian for his movements, facials and performances of "not people". This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser trying to be a hero, and one day nobody will accept a call from a man being attacked. Therefore, Marvin must accept this case and rescue the attacked man. On the way to the crime scene, however, he crashes his car and is badly damaged. He does not remember what's going on, and the next day, his life is not the same when he finds out he has animal instincts. Of course we have our wife who tries to reach our main character, but his attempts are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. The negative character is fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal person again. By the way - his animal instinct helps him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The movie is so unreal that in some moments it gets stupid, but it's one of those films called mindless fun, as I wrote above. Check out the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies of all time or one of the best movies in which Schneider performs. He's a great comedian, but this is not his best movie.
