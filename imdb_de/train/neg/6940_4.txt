If you have two tower houses of artists working against each other, the best thing you can expect is the excellent camaraderie. This is the case in this film where we have a 64-year-old Amitabh-Bachchan romance and a 34-year-old taboo. Waiting! In fact, all this is in the name of the action, so instead of "cheeni" it is the content that is "cum" in this adman who first sought out scriptwriter director R. Balkis. <br /> <br /> Trust the two older actors who bring the house down with their white crises and bittersweet moments of love in this unconventional couple, and that's all you do in a slow but refreshing first Find half. The locales of London captured in the rainy season are fascinating. At the end of the first half, the romance was complete and the mission accomplished. There is not much to say. Thus, in the second half, in the form of a girl's father, there is a strange contradiction, to the extent that he advocates a satyagra, a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax as he gives in. The second half is dry, shallow and without energy. There is a subplot with a girl who dies of cancer and has no great influence. Nonetheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performances.
