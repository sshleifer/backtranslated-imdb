Nathan Detroit makes illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is hot and he can not find a safe place. He tells chronicler Sky Masterson that Sky can not get a primitive missionary, Sarah Brown, to dine with him. Sky accepts the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store. <br /> <br /> This is one of those fancy MGM musicals of the fifties in sparkling color, with big sets, loud music and oversized roles and matching performances. Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that, which I do not like. My main problem with these movies is just the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but swing-time Broadway shows with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet blossoms at the end of every fourth bar are not my thing. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of stories by Damon Runyon), and although the plot is quite appealing, the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers, for example, are identical, unnecessary, do not show off the appearance and the rust on the ears (and are also obviously misogynist if disturbed by this kind of thing). There are only two memorable tunes: Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra, as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (beautifully performed by Kaye), but you've got two hours to go them. The trump card of the film is a young brando who shows a thoughtful, relaxed performance. He also sings pretty well and even dances a bit and is evenly tuned with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which they flee to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vocal murder of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals may like to understand that, but in my view a musical has to do more than film the stage show.
