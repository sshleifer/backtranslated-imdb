It's just breathtaking, it's awful - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem: he's the only one on the screen who can actually get his own if he's like something that resembles natural cadences and twists, he either ruins the film by pointing out the shortcomings of everyone else, or he saves it by providing a context for their awfulness view-- thanks to him it works as a comedy. He is the 7-footer in a Dwarven basketball game, his abilities are simply not valid in this context, and his disagreement is delicious. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure, however, is that Mrs. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so pervasive that I actually googled her and expected to find out she was a Russian beauty who phonetically pronounced her lines without understanding their meaning. But no, she's just a talented American who laughs at you with every line she drops. Whether she knew what the lines meant must remain open.
