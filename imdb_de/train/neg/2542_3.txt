... not that all Disney movies are garbage. Anyway, I first saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" and absolutely loved the movie. When I heard that it had 2 sequels, I was thrilled. I finally found a copy of it and looked at it one evening. I do not see how they can make a G-rated horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about the Fauke Monster and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be observed by anyone. I can not remember the plot well since it's been some time since I saw it, and I will not look at it anymore, but ... It's about these hunters coming into the city looking for them to kill Bigfoot. Three small children moan out of the house to stop them. A big monsoon comes through. The hunters are injured, are rescued by the children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large piece of tarpaulin and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin any of you, but it's not scary. Well....
