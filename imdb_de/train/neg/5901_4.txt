Something to sing was produced at Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked during a contract dispute with the Warner brothers. He has made two films for this B studio, none of which are high in the Cagney credits. <br /> <br /> One of the big losses for the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney has made so few films using his excellent dancing skills. The two who come to mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and never steal anything small. Cagney himself said he had never seen anything other than his musicals when retired. Why did he make so few of them? <br /> <br /> Well, this was all wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About concerns a hoofer who plays for a band that has discovered and received a film contract. There are the usual complications exerted by a boss of the executive studio and a media agent well-played by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract provides for a no-marriage clause, which is why Cagney and singer Evelyn Daw, a bandmaid, secretly marry. Then we get the complication of an advertising community with Mona Barrie. I think you can find out where that leads. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a beautiful singing voice and the radiance of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the moviegoers paid their tickets to Cagney's dance. <br /> <br /> Besides giving some dance numbers, a female dance partner would have been nice, too. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in the Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in West Point Story. Were Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler not available? <br /> <br /> There were no memorable songs out of it. And Daw's voice is also waisted. She has a Jeanette MacDonald soprano voice that was so out of place with a swing band. No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
