I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; All icons in their own way. However, the train accident of Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me. Her acting was so terrible that I sat there with my jaw open and did not trust my eyes and ears. I could barely make it through a consideration, that's how disgusting she is in this one. Cary? Beautiful and in a fine dramatic form. Jayne Enchanting, lovable and obviously a ball. The side cast is fine and the city of San Francisco is captured in its stunning retro elegance. Then one sees Suzy Parker, who tries to speak their lines with a woodiness, a deadliness and a cluelessness simply defies the belief. Who told this creature that it could ACT? Oy VEY, people.
