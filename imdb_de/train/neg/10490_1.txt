I notice that the previous reviewer (who seems to be still at school) has given this film a very good review, and I can only assume that the reviewer did not see the far superior BBC adaptation of this classic novel from 1989 , The main problem I had with this (1999) version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who became famous after appearing on the television miniseries The Choir. I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long because of his outstanding acting in "The Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" had turned into a big and lanky youth when "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and therefore Anthony does not convince him to convince him as a student Tom. It's too far from the idea of ​​believing that Tom (as played by Anthony) befriends much younger Hatty. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty are much closer and the development of their friendship is much more credible. For a movie from 1999, the special effects can not convince and represent no noticeable improvement in the TV effects of 1989. Casting and Acting this version are inferior to the previous adjustment and overall the film was a dull gloss version of a true classic. As a last remark I would like to point out that the VHS of the BBC version of 1989 retrieves a second hand of over 20,00 Euro, while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than 5,00 GBP. Do I have to say more?
