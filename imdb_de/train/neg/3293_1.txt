What a snore party. <br /> <br /> Of all the nostalgia Hollywood has decided to remake and update, this is one of the most pointless. This was a completely pointless show in the first place, and we REALLY NEED NOT a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> No matter what bigotry and sexism the system entails from the beginning, so much progress has been made. It has been socialized since the show ran, that the whole point of the show (if he ever had one ) has been lost. <br /> <br /> What is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he is not overweight?
