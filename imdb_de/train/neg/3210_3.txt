There's really no way around the bush when you say that: Lady Death: The movie is just shit. Aside from the fact that the protagonist is a well-dressed blonde running to hell in a leather bikini with occasional graphic violence, the film seems to have evolved with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a series of action Based on characters. The villain himself even speaks like a skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory awkward stooge, and lives in a cave that seems to have been styled after the villainous domain of the old Blackstar caricatures on Saturday morning. Just do not expect any humor other than the sometimes howling dialogue. At other times, it feels like a kind of anime story better suited to hentai, but there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank god!) And very little sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the titular character. This material simply has no benefit to adults, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. What we have here is essentially a feature length of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with sparse clothes and more gore.
