"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is the worst film ever made, far more lame than the incompetent "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The Lampoon movie is told in Three Segments, each of which is supposedly a spoof of a conventional film genre, but each one ends up at our feet with a sickening bang. There is no rhyme or reason for these vile vignettes and no recognizable storylines. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the movie are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a bit of flesh, and it's very pretty too. However, the directors do not seem to know that even T & A needs a good story to surround them. There is nothing of that. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, eager Beaver cop, paired with a cynical vintage car from Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who still see this vile cinematic practice are encouraged by the thought that we are seeing a redemptive story of how the young, idealistic cop makes a purifying change in the old man's approach causes police work. But no luck. As I said, this movie has no redeeming values. It gets sick until the final fade-out, which is stretched perverted longer than it should remain on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew that they had something bad and wanted to make the least of it.
