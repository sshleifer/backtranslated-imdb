I now and then turn 700 Clubs on and agree with only a few statements - I am one of many believers who are considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I agree, and it's usually not a representative. or the. I do not believe that 700 clubs tell people what they should believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative circumstances. I think many people misunderstand what is said on 700 club. it scolds me to hear the name in both directions. I think 700 Club people really love Jesus but are so busy getting people to vote conservatively for forgetting to show love to certain people and to promote peace as Jesus did. Do not judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant persons who believe in Him, and let us not ignore our comments about them. Why are people so mean to each other?
