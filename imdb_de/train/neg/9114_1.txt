Because "cruel" would be the only word that describes the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you start? I will start with a dazzling goose bump with the horrible spectacle of almost everyone in this movie. Forget it. Almost does not belong in this sentence. I can not imagine a single character that was well represented. In all fairness, however, it would be nearly impossible to successfully portray these zero-dimensional characters. Even so, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposely disagree with - pretending that it does not exist) - is still one of the worst actors I've ever seen, just behind the man who played Sebastian. The story was awful god. It tried to mirror the brilliance that was the first, but failed in many ways. Pretty much every part was pointless - though I have to admit (reluctantly) that the plot was pretty good, it was his surprise. And the end was at least a bit humorous. But this movie is up there with the worst I've ever seen. Do not look at it. Simply not. It is absolutely worthless to see it. None. It only takes the first enjoyment.
