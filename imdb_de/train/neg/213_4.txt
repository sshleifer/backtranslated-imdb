Yes, in fact it could be a good movie. A love-biangle (sorry for the poetic license, but no triangle!) - an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The picture is sometimes funny, sometimes fine, the picture looks crowded and engrossed. The sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), the light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About the acting ... sorry, but the best actress is the landlady. The others are immature and can not convince the viewer. The play is poetic, if it should be realistic, and realistic, if it should be poetic. It is a picture for adults, told by the children. Trouble only when extremely curious.
