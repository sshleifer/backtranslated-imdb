Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis plays in this horrible third sequel to the once-fun and entertaining "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". The concept is basically the same as the first movie, but shrunk with the adults instead of the children and with the inner house instead of the garden as the universe. If you think that sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring at best, in the worst case an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> First, the continuity of the series was completely flushed to the bathroom. The only remaining actor in the first film is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress who plays his wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, those who play the neighbors have changed ... they call it. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results are confusing, to say the least. Second, the story is a reprint of the first, without a bit of originality. All the few jokes (and there are hardly any of them) and the dangerous situations depicted in the movie are simply copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, the special effects. I am sure that this was done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, far worse than the ones that appear in the rest of the series. One should admire these little figures exploring the vast domestic area, but in the end you will probably be frightened most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth, locating what's going on in the house is just so boring. Few things happen, and when they happen they are not exciting at all. The first film was amusing because the children were occupied with nature, the grass and the beetles living in it. In this case, the adults (who are rather boring compared to the children) are dealing with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing such a banal series against the already startled series appealed to Disney's executives, except perhaps because they had to make money without spending five minutes over to think something new. I warn you: Leave this tasteless garbage where it should stay: Put dust in the shelves of the store.
