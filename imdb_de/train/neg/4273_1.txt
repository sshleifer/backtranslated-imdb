There is nothing unique in the TV series or the film. This is a prequel to the TV show, which is nowhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynch's disgusting narrative style and afterwards. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach. And be introduced to some of the most absent-minded, dodgy, immoral characters of the Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> For the genius, who almost looks almost pedophilically repulsive, the movie seems romantic about the destruction of a human life by some coincidence Psychedelic Phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire come with me for a walk. <br /> <br /> I looked at everything, just to make sure I did not miss anything. It's just an obvious sexual fetish of a man stretching over long series drawn by a ridiculous, overly pornographic film. Save yourself the agony of tension and look at everything else that has at least the ability to tell a story, and then seduce you into a mental porno movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of criticisms, ranting and raving about how great David Lynch is. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and make it a wonderful thing. This is not an art that imitates life, as it is some sick, twisted version of the art that does its best to inspire a complete, mindless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
