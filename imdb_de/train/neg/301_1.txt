This is the worst documentary that ever came out of Canada !!!! I am happy to see that the boys have not made another film. All they want to do is make a movie, and it does not have to be who they wrote. You change the script to match the person playing it. I could not leave the theater fast enough when I saw it at this year's Toronto Film Festival. Please never watch this movie.
