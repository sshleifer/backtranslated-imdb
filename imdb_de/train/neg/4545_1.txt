This delicious fusion of New Age babblers and loud, bad movies may not make you "open" to borrow one of the movie's favorite verbs, but it can make your jaw go limp and your stomach sore from laughing or choking , Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, first published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch pursues the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who emerges while traveling in the deepest, darkest, most phonetic Peru and sniffing the air or something else illegal. What he discovers is a Shangri-La loop populated by smiling zombies that may be crazy or hard-to-medicate, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe and an occasional cry of sky-scarf. Although much is talked about "energy", this quality is clearly missing the colorful cast, including Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who are now all firmly in the camp Pantheon. For those who are interested, the plot includes the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inappropriate direction, while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain, and Dan Gordon wrote the scream of a script. In short, by far the worst movie in over 40 years.
