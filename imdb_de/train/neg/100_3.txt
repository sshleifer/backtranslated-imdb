OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I was able to see and see it TWICE! The story was pretty awful, and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what the hell I was looking at, but at the same time it was so terrible that I laughed it cheap, all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. The only thing that failed him was halfway. He stopped his stupid name. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was pretty perfidious, but if you laugh at cheap laughter and you laugh at it in Pfundland, go away.
