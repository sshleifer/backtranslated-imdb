The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and missing. The spectacle is boundless funny. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I've seen a movie that does not live up to its true ability. The only salvation I have found with this film is the production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects that millions of wasps were deceived are easy to sell and were revolutionary at the time. Apart from the production value, I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this movie.
