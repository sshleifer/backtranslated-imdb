Stephen Feinberg, who was the proctologist and one of the film's authors, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, a year later, when he told me that he had been a Hollywood writer years ago, mostly on TV promos , He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had already seen it! Actually, I had seen it years ago when it was released. At the time, I did not think it was such a bad movie. As an adult, however, I saw something different. Yes, it's a bit old-fashioned. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. He was just a little proud of the "The Proctologist" sketch.
