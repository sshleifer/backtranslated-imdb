Under-average movie with bad music considering a movie based on music ??? Ordinary Script & Director with many mistakes. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajay's performance deteriorated over time, while his looks, especially his rock star style, were pathetic. Asin was just a showpiece. Overall, I wanted to waste my money in the cinema. Compared to Aamir Khan, Salman Khan is as immature as he was 10 years ago. There were many songs in the movie that were boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the British music sponsor was extremely unimpressive. "Khanabadosh" can be easily understood by an English music sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", a simple slow love story with good direction and acting despite average music
