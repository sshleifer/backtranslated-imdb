Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a force in the Wild West, one of six regular outsiders who pull themselves together in a touring show. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but these women never last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke? Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). It seems that Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is a supposed heiress who will receive the estate of her long-dead father only if she is married to her thirtieth birthday, that is, on the eve of that birthday Cartoons Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what about this movie? It's difficult to say. There's the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that in the first half of the movie, she's so haughty and vile that when she suddenly becomes one of the troops in the middle of the movie, not only is she unbelievable, but also the audience is no longer interested in her. There is a chronic shortage of funds behind the Wild West show, but this topic has not yet been touched enough to truly be the film's raison d'Ãªtre. There is Miss Lilly's situation that she is stranded in the rural West, cut off from the funds that spur her spoiled luxury life (she falsely believes she is dead of her family and the press). But should we really believe that she could not go back to New York and her waiting for a fortune, if she made a little effort? No, the meaning of this movie seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovable group of losers hanging through thick and thin together. This is a warm, blurry movie? or at least trying to be. <br /> <br /> On the way, Clint shows us his skills with a weapon and even thwarts a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent movie. One of the gangs is arrested on charges of avoiding the evasion. Billy captivates the local sheriff. The tent of the show burns down; an orphanage makes it a new one. But many worldly pitfalls do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> The problem is mitigated by the action or absence of a problem. Aside from Scatman Crothers, the side cast is pretty amateurish. Eastwood is also not at the top of his game, though he just looks better because he's surrounded by such a dull bunch. <br /> <br /> And for all that, the movie stops for 116 minutes. To what point Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
