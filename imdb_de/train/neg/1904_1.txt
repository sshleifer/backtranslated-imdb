=== smaller spoilers === <br /> <br /> Like many others, I am a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So, when I saw all the beautiful posters in front of the MI: 2 drive by, expectations rose. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? A lot of. <br /> <br /> The script is neither funny (which makes it really hard) nor exciting. They've put in a black who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! you have comedy I do not think the excitement is completely out of the picture. First of all (and that is probably often said) there are no sympathetic characters, so who cares who gets killed? If you can stand the assumption that a Psycho Nics brother will kill you if he does not steal 50 cars within 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is going to walk Nic on the street again. Is that excitement? Do not think so. Then come the best - the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored, Nic having to pronounce all those stupid lines. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see someone?" 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there's just a glimmer of hope: The car hunts. They are disappointing, to say the least, because the trailer looked like it was full of them and there is only one. A very long, irritating, hectic camera movement. I really had trouble tracking the action. <br /> <br /> So is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - You do not have to decide, avoid this terrible mess. I'm awarded 3 out of 10 stars and I feel generous.
