Ever wondered what would happen if a few characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV audience. That would be fine, but the story was badly executed. Thought turns, bad dialogues and unresolved problems abound. This little movie does not deserve the right to be as cryptic as it is in the end. A potential spoiler and an incredibly absurd plot line - the wrong moment when the hotel employee discovers that the girls have no room there and just throw them out. (This moment is played with the same seriousness and gravity as the moment they are arrested at gunpoint). Later, the same hotel employee is somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, I was there - testifying against the girls as if a couple of free Mai Tai's would justify 40 years in prison. Come on. Instead, rent another day in paradise.
