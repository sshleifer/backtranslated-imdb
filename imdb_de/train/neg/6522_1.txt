This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I do not know if there were different versions and updates, but the rented hard drives had a copyright of 2000, if that means anything. In any case, the sound mix on these DVDs was absolutely terrible. The levels were often turned up and down; As the scene became a battlefield panorama, the orchestra music thundered so loud that I did not know what would be blown out first - my eardrum or my speakers. When it was time for a dialogue, the volume usually dropped to something barely audible. Occasionally the orchestra and the Foley work remained loud, while the dialogue was superimposed on a much lower level. My wife and I found out that we could only watch this movie from those DVDs when one of us held a hand on the remote control to continuously adjust the volume. As another user commented, the dialogue between Russian and English changed. and occasionally, if the characters on the native lane spoke French, the synchronization was in Russian, so you are SOL if you both do not understand. Finally, we gave up looking for the first disc. Before you spy $ 50 + for this movie on DVD for your own library, I urge you to get a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when it's loaded with such a bad sound especially if you do. Never read the book and really want to understand the story.
