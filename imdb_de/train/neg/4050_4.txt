This is a pretty outdated film that seeks to show young people's yearning for freedom in a dehumanized British school. Oh yes, it's like being in the army, you learn to obey and do what you are commanded to do. Yes, the boys dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically you could summarize the beautiful intentions in If .... Beautiful intentions that do not create cinematic challenges: The result is a declamatory film. Do you see how boring I mean? At least this oldie Kubrick helped make McDowell appear in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a really strong social satire and no smug sentimentalism.
