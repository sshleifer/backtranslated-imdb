Impressive. I can not really remember this movie except that it stunk. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; The parents of a girl neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one who gets disturbed? Then this weird PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mom to pretend she's the girl's. I do not care if he tried to make the girl happy, that's just disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was no real conspiracy. The girl was just a whining brat who wanted things in her own way. She played with Unowns, was the "daughter" of Entei, and apparently with the help of her "father" could grow out of age and shrink. I think you can take it as a hint and not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, borrow "PokeMon; the first movie".
