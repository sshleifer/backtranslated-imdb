Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has corroded his mind due to his work, combined with memories of abusive parenting by his stepfather Barry (Gunnar Hansen's original Leatherface). He turns into madness and finally to serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald dumb man) fight for control of his soul. This movie is torn off by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes. Not to say that it's awful or just anything, just that you say it's only as well known as it is because of Bruce Campbell's rabid fan base (of which I'm one), who probably sees everything he's in any way Way is together. <br /> <br /> My Rating: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second commentary by Kallio and sound designer Joel Newport; "Hate Every Minute," a 17-minute documentary. deleted and extended scenes; alternative takes; Outtakes, recordings of the world premiere; Poster & Gallery still; Talent Bios; and movie trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Screenplay in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter Eggs: Mark the eyes for a laughing outtake (left eye) and a minute of just a current Easter egg (right eye)
