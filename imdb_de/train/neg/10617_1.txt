Probably encouraged by admirers of her much better "Orlando," Potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst possible way: writing, directing, starring, and even recording the music, including a Mawkian love song. The film is strongly reminiscent of a teenage high school or college project that believes its own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as intriguing to us as it is to them. But Potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikely, and the entire film is an embarrassing portrayal of narcissism disguised as a celebration of tango. If she had not thrown herself, it might have worked. She just can not act, whether she plays herself or not. Assertive, over-ambitious, boring and stupid.
