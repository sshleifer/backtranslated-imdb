Holy @ #% & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile with which it was made. I tried to watch this pile of rotting garbage, but it was easier to cut my wrists and beat back a shooter with Lysol floor cleaner than having to endure more than half of the garbage on my screen. I put that well below anything I've ever seen in film or television, and that says something. I once saw a cow dump in a field. I watched the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows, maybe he moved or something. Well, that was a better time than watching this trip. The acting was not there, the plot was different than in this movie. I think I saw an early cut where the attack could escape. He rode in the background on an old pickup truck going to Portland, hoping to become a Steven King Shi77er. Please tell me that the director gets medication that he so desperately needs. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medication, and I would be prepared to use the money for his reversal of the lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the full punch it needs, because nothing so painful can do justice to the typed word alone. Let me just say: If you are looking for a movie that lasts some time, and you see this Chilton on the rack, go to your car, start the engine, and then put both fists in the fan, until you can not feel it Your bones vibrate even more. Make sure you have your wallet in your hand because you would still be wasting the money. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself. By the way, I looked at it after a "buddy" of mine sent his girlfriend so I could see it. He did not come, she had it too. What's worse is that she had to see this $% & @ thing TWICE! I have heard that they are married and he can visit his balls once a month. I hope it was this movie.
