This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "Little Man" crap is just so stupid. The entire film is unrealistic and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is just a pointless, horrible piece that should never have been brought to the theater. The jokes are not funny and the acting is terrible. Please, I ask you to save your money, than to see this worthless piece of crap. I had to sit through Little Man for an hour and a half, wishing my eyes were bleeding. I am disgusted that something like this is even thought of! Who writes this crap? The actors have NO talent, how do these people get to Hollywood? You make money with this garbage!
