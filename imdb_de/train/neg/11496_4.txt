a documentary about one of Guatemala's darkest places. portrayed as a fun, safe ... but sad place where a bunch of sex workers should play in a football team that has put together in what appears to be no more than a week! The documentary focuses primarily on proving that society repels this kind of "worker," even though these poor women will never get a solution, except that the people who documented it made them "stars." (just like the title) says in exchange for being exploited to portray this reality as a documentary. but it does have its own documented reality ... but unfortunately that has nothing to do with the main story. I would not accept seeing it again. but I would only recommend it for general cultural purposes.
