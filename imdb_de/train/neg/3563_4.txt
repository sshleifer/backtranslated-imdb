For the most part, the movie feels like a "Made for TV". The director is claustrophobic, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. In particular, Denise Crosby delivers her lines as if she were reading it cold from a cue card. Only one thing makes this movie worth seeing, and that's when Gage returns from the Semetary. It's a bit disturbing watching a little kid kill someone, and this movie could be more than some people can handle for that reason. It is absolutely crispy. This movie only does one thing right, but it beats the one thing out of the park. Worth seeing only for the last 10 minutes.
