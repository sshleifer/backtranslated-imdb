This film begins with the execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his lover. His head is cut off and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "The thing that would not die", right? Well, it's a bit like that, but when the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and cruel deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean, the movie is only 88 minutes long and I always thought "when will it end"? The characters in the movie are mostly idiots, and they really deserve to die because they are really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he moves slowly and you really wonder how he manages to do it, considering he's scared of jewelry. The only thing you can see after reattaching your head is the fact that so many breasts are flashed that you really lose track. I still want to see a horror movie, not a softcore porno, and as a horror movie it's way too slow, with many slow steps to even have a bit of fun. And do not read the back of the box because it looks like carnivorous zombies are attacking the city, there's no ... just a small scene in which three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily rejected in the movie not a factor at all and their scene is rather pointless. So I say you should avoid this movie unless you think it's really cheap.
