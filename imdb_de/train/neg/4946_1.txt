Granted, I saw this piece with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon I watched and was 100% free of humor. It is rude, offensive, redneck and obviously against women. As such, it's a creation that does the planks justice, but the average viewer is more likely to be deterred by it. No wonder it was never shown in a movie theater: It would have bombarded a big time! <br /> <br /> Not even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros could save this crazy piece. Save time and money!
