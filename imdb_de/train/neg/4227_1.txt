I am amazed that I have actually seen and seen this. I love independent movies, horror movies and the whole zombie thing in general. However, if you add Ningas, you have exceeded a limit that should never be exceeded. I hope the people in this movie had a great time creating it, then at least it was not a total waste. You would never know it when you see it. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees made fakes. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera. Period. I do not think there was an actual planning involved in the making of this film. So a total waste of time that I do not comment on it.
