I grew up with Baptist and I know that the story that this movie tries to tell, though I do not believe the story anymore. I give the movie a kudo for being as good as the week's average lifetime movie. Moderately interesting, mediocre, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is juicy and it's a bit melodramatic. And all those left behind must be the squeakiest, cleanest non-Christians of all time. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor who plays the man who heads the United Nations, "Nuclear" "Nu-Cu-Ler" uttered as, just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of ethics, which requires since Bush claims he is called by God that all Christians need to cover up his ignorance by incorrect predictions of this word in the same way? LOL! I really had a hard time taking the movie seriously. Following the incident "nu-cu-ler", the film felt like a packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something brave. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, you should stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, for looking elsewhere.
