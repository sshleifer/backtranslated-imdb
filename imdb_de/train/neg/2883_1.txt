This movie is just so awful. So bad that I can not bear to spend anything but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crime is correctly replicated. Many slaughterhouse shots. Funny cuts and edits. No continuity to action. Acting is absolutely the amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make money, regardless of the accuracy of the content. The camera work is sometimes blurred and always shaky. It looks like it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> Actually, now that they have Dennis Rader in jail life, I wish they'd jail the boys who made this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think to see this one. I would give him a negative star if I could.
