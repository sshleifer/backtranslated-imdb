It's hard to criticize this movie because I do not like the story itself and not a good drama could have saved that. Think of "Raising Arizona" with a base series. Acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly is as usual exaggerated (but not enough to make a nice movie out of it) somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has constantly disturbed the eyebrows, either by straining their parts or by straining the whole pointless exercise. A really cumbersome few hours of film. Darryl Hannah cries most of the movie too much to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I went out, sorry.
