Given the fact that this film was put together in less than a year, this could explain its brevity (81 minutes - including the credits, ie about 76 minutes of the actual film). What it can not explain, however, is the lack of humor that the previous film possessed. <br /> <br /> The jokes are fast and sometimes not even funny. The only real thing is the fast parodies on the Nike basketball courts, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the exorcist, and trifles scattered throughout the film. Very unusual was the launch of Charlie's Angels, who, like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin-off scene, recreated the scene basically with little humor to the parody gags of the classic supernatural horror movies of the 70s, like the Exorcist and maybe the poltergeist of the 80s, et al. al. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Scary Movie 3 will take some time to make the parodies more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, but the movie offers more than the last promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I'll admit seemed to be exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for their casting and acting skills, I give this movie a "3" of "10".
