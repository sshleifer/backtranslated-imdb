Nothing can be compared to Vampires Vs. Zombies ... in every area of ​​filmmaking I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were stunning. When there was an explosion on the television screen, I thought that my whole house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells landed on the ground next to me. Just numb my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene where Jack Black-Sound-a-like gives the worst monologue I've ever heard, I almost killed, but do not worry, since he's on fire in the movie Can he give up his terrible acting on "I have to be high". Seriously, he must have watched himself babble about noncongruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense, and he just added that he must be "tall" to justify his terrible spectacle. Well, if you can say that, to apologize for the horrible spectacle, if you talked to the writers, directors, executive producers and sponsors, you will probably get the same answer ... seriously. With a production team called "shock-o-rama" I was shocked that I did not put a sawed-off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after that horribly horrible apology for a movie was played. If you want to see this movie then you should be murdered <br /> <br /> Best regards <br /> <br /> The General
