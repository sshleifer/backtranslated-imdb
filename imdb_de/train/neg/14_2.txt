There are times when a movie should be finished to receive a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I gave up for almost 15 minutes to endure ... and I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The pace that moves a man from a straightforward, controlled life to one of utter spinelessness and to one Overcoming irresponsibility could never be so fast. <br /> <br /> From a graduation party to the foreseeable end of private and cultural man Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), he lets himself be seduced by a woman, by violence and mental changes Substances. Of course, the proportion of women in the observation of the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley) is understandable. But for a penny for a pound of drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met, it is impossible to understand. Honestly, apart from being able to gawk at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this movie has no redeeming qualities. Save money, save time ... do something different ...
