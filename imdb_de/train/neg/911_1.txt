This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that such a bad screenplay would become a movie in 2006 and be screened in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why so many well-known actors even thought the idea of ​​being visible in a movie like this one. If I had respect for some well-known actors in this movie before I saw the movie, it's definitely gone. <br /> <br /> I have heard that there will be a sequel to this film, and I can not understand how it is possible at all.
