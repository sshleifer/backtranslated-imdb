Usually I have no problem with unfounded curses in movies, but that really annoyed me. They only swore. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noticed, getting cancer) It was boring, wandering and overbearing. If I were you. <br /> <br /> It's also not that I do not like movies that, like most people who like it, will claim to watch life. I love Eat Drink Man Woman and all that happens is that a lot of Taiwanese are leading their lives. But I could relate to you. I have never met anyone who has sworn so much as the "actors" in this movie, and I was working on a construction site. So go figure. After I said that William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy boredom.
