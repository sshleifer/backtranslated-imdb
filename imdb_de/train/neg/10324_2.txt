The Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a chance to produce the simplest comedy programming for the eldest onlookers who are the most easily offended, which means for CBC's 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and therefore I can not believe it. The performances are very hammy and exaggerated, but I do not blame the actors, as these one-dimensional, stereotypical characters are probably just what the CBC demands and demands. A very lame show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial". It's less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
