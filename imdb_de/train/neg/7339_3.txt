Maya is a woman without interests. She just dreams of her life and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting topic. That would require a good story, a nice environment and good dialogues. It has none of that. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no highlights. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. Although I'm a big fan of his, I could not stand this movie. He too can not make this movie exciting. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you are an art house fan or you like it slowly, you might like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it does not start. My recommendation: Do not look at it.
