I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my dad. First, let me say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. The movie itself, however, was poorly done and the acting was terrible. The main problem I had with the film was the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not entirely accurate. My father suffered from mental disorders at that time and attacked Nichole, without even wanting to hurt her. He loved her like a daughter and felt that he was saving her from some sort of injury or neglect that he probably believed came from her mother, who had been with her for more than three years Caring, paying little attention, and waking her up so that her mother could frolic. The film portrayed my father as damaging her in some way. The funny part is that Nichole sometimes spent many nights with my fathers while Sharon worked or did what she did. The reason my father was originally believed to be violent was because he had items that could be designed as weapons on his truck. My father was a landscape gardener. The objects they considered weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck for work all the time. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on real events, but the details of the movie (at least the part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate, showing the director's failure to discover The truth, if you tell the story. The funny thing is, if the director had asked one of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, he would have stated exactly what I posted here.
