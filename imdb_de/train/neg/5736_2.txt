This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years !! You could accidentally pull 5 people off the street and they could behave better than anyone else in this movie. Absolute waste of time while watching. I only gave him a 2 because I like bloody movies, but that's just garbage. Acting (and I use that term VERY casually) is miserable. Please tell me that the 5 main actors in this movie made their first film. Do not waste your time watching this. Hostel was in a way a better movie. I can not believe that someone has spent money on it, I hope for the producers that it costs only $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project being made by children who have no idea. Did it even make it to the cinema?
