The film is a collection of stereotypes about everything that's out there. It has no focus, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is exaggerated and stereotyping is plentiful and outrageous. This film can not resist the temptation to make drama where there are none. Any small exchange of words immediately becomes a lengthy, unjustified dialogue typical of an acting rehearsal. Where this exchange has no substance, the actors (no matter how good they normally are) can not but compensate for exaggerated emotions (aka "increasing stakes"). About acting, to put it simply. The director does not help here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced to fake and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying Punk Rock with The Who, piercings and eye-catching 90s outfits. Characters walk without role, detail and motive. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, where meaning and art are torn out. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I give that. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This movie is Lee's mistake. He was sold out like the rest of them. Became irrelevant. He has nothing more interesting to say. <br /> <br /> I do not feel like seeing anything from this guy again (which I do not want to call from now on).
