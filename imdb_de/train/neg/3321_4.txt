Usually, after the first minute of a movie, I know if I hate or worship him ... but now I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was great; the "this is based on a true story" and blah blah blah which was weird. After the cartoons and the description of the boys' lives with pictures, I thought I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then it was cool to see the funny glow of Toronto. Also the situation and the appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> These were maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which looked like an eternity afterwards. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just do not understand Canadian English humor (that's possible, English Canadians do not always understand Quebecois humor), but hey ... there was enough material for a short film, * nothing more. Maybe that could be a meaning for the title? In any case, almost everything was filling, and very few things were almost weird in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "Making of" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I rented the movie because I'm interested in the "annoying disappearance of people". But I did not know that the entire universe would disappear, and even a point about the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're an English Canadian, it seems you appreciate the local sense of humor given the surprising number of people who have given this movie an 8. Otherwise, think twice before you lose your precious time ...
