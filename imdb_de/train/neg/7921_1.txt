The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, but what remains is strange extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if anyone had actually seen it. The plot is interrupted and absolutely pointless in some (far too many) cases. The real miracle here is why in the world this sequel to such an unsuccessful and abominable (but still slightly better) movie was created Laughing.
