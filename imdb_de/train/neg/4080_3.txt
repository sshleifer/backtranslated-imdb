This seems to be one of those films that we think we should like, but I did not. It seemed too hard to be 'artistic'. Everything flashes without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and each of them is beautiful to look at, but pack them all together and it becomes a tedious task just to persevere. I rented it because there were glowing reviews on the video boxes and I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit demanding and sometimes boring.
