I fully agree with the other comment. Someone should make a what-up Tiger Lily with this movie. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French films I have seen in a long time (actually with Brotherwood.) of the Wolves, 2 cruel movies in too short a time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea somehow fun. Especially Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rochefort, who were among my favorites, I was bitterly disappointed that they were compromised in such a bad movie and famous parents can get you into the movies, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh, instead watch an Alain Chabat or a nice piece of fun at LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
