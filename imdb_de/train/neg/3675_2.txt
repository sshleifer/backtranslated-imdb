Actually everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder, the casting is not done with the left hand, but not at all. I have not seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who embodies a kind of agent with a weapon. You're not using a spoiled city-spit look in such a role. I can only imagine throwing Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also terrible, possibly with the only exception being hurt, sometimes you see him try but suffer. Did I mention that it is a completely crazy story? To endanger the lives of many peoples because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German / 2/10, because the photography could be worse.
