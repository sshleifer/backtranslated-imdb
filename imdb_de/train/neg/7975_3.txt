As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma could have done with it!" Chances are, you will too. It starts to fascinate. A British park ranger who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty, reserved brunette (Lisa Zane), whom he recently met in a park. Then one day she disappears. The police can not find any documents they ever had, and Firth carries out his own search. So far, so good. Just as he's about to give up, he turns to his best friend (Billy Zane) and they stumble over their past lives in LA's filthy underground of drugs, nightclubs and filmmaking and then their history of mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the movie is falling apart. None of Lisa Zane's characters from the past are interesting from afar. The movie moves slowly and there is little action. There is a subplot regarding the lack of drug money, but it's just a disposable. No chases, no clipping sequences and no tension. Just a few boring beats and a lot of chat with boring characters. Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in one scene together. At the end of the film you are torn between the question of what might have been and trying to stay awake.
