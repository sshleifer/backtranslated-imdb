Pretty amusing piece that tries to show how smart Orcas are, but in the meantime (and not to mention them) the audience feels stupid making the most ridiculous movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, that's wrong. He plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale. If the capture of a female killer whale goes awry (do not ask), his partner (do not ask) runs into a raid (do not ask) and starts to STALKING Captain Nolan (do not ask). Captain Nolan soon realizes they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty amazing filmmaking here people. However, I have to tell you, the beginning (with the whale sounds and nothing else) is pretty haunting and the credits (with the God-fearing song) are pretty entertaining.
