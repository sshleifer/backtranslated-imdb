Antonioni's films have not aged well. What has always amazed me is that, in addition to undeniable plastic beauty, there is a boring and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Think, for example, of the conversations between Mastroianni and the "capitalist capitalist" who wants to sing him in "La notte" or Monica Vitti, who laughs at the peasants flirting on the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti, who plays the Ink glass drops at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I checked "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this film, there are many beautiful and detailed footage of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of LA, the advertisements, the deserts, etc., which show the author's fascination on his American journey much later than Wim Wenders. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left clich√©s that spoil the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane and flies across the desert to free himself and find "something else". - The executives in gray suites are constantly talking about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like that. - The middle-class couple in the caravan speaks of the beauty of nature in building a hotel and making a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples who love the desert. What a hippie platoon! <br /> <br /> Today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except "Le amiche" and maybe.) "Il grido ") are just a handful of aesthetics and commonplaces.
