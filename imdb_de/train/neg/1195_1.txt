This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this cruel experience just to end the pain. I recommend, instead of seeing this movie, you bathe in acid, then you will know at least a fraction of the pain without any scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD and when at the beginning it was added that Jesus was following them I was so excited ... then in the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean, a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... ONLY PAIN! Monkeys could have done better to handle this garbage. At least they would have throwing feces and blurring some garbage. It would have been better not to have seen any of the horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not understand the jokes, but that not only were they not funny, they also repeated themselves twenty times. Apparently, something is not funny, unless you see it like a million times. <br /> <br /> Do not see this. "Manos the Hands of Fate" was rated by people as the worst movie in the world. I've seen that, too, and agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is far worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves all kinds of harsh language, but I can not write this here. I can only imagine that I oath a whole bunch.
