This game has the (in) honor of being the first game where I stopped playing in the middle of the middle. I had the feeling of being smashed to pieces and then burned. Congratulations. First and last Tomb Raider I'll ever play, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> Content: Typing this word made me laugh. There is none. There is also no character development. We finally have a heroine who can take care of herself, who is not * whistling * Mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast is huge. You had to put on the sexist boy players you see. All she does is shoot grave after grave as she goes on. Why she does that, I have no idea. I had subtitles and the t.v. as loud as I could and I still understood nothing. The development (or lack of it) for her, her two friends, and the villains were ridiculous. There will also be stages you need to go through without giving any indication of what to do next, and you will literally be in the most boring hell graves for HOURS trying to figure out what the hell you are about There are one of two classes, especially with her on a motorcycle (Believe me, it's no fun at all), where you're in ATLEASE for an HOUR with NO safety point in sight. That means you get hit by the other drivers and guys in vans shooting at you, or you hit a tree, and you start the long-distance trek OVER, have essentially no save points, have no history, no character development no variety of games, most of the music on the longest levels have ear bleeding and give the player no clues so they can stay longer in one place instead of getting to the nonexistent conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: They sound like crazy ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck 2: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or undrilled gameplay. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem to impress the player extremely. <br /> <br /> Boss stupid F * ck: Shut up, Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: Everything she does is shoot. Of course she can turn around at SHOOTING, jump at SHOOTING or kick again at SHOOTING. But turning around, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that all she finally does is SHOOTING. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is extremely beautiful. I like to listen. The music in the game ranges from bearable way to want to cut off your ears. <br /> <br /> Visuals: Considering that this game was made in 2006, I expected the visuals to blow me away. Well, I was totally thrilled Not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This game is a devious, no character development with a barely dressed, unmarysuish (THANK YOU) young women at the helm, for some boring ones Graves is a boring reason (which I could not tell you) with an unimaginative shooting gameplay. STAY AWAY FROM THESE B.S. !!!!!!!! There are two stars for women who are not girls in distress (no matter how weak they may be) and the beauty of music.
