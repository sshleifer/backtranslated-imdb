I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery. It was 2 buy, 2 received, and I needed one more, so I chose this one. Terrible mistake. The box reads like it's a really good movie. Well, it starts as if it's going to be this great movie. That's about 5 minutes long. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed as she tries to rescue her friend Jack from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a rancher who scares citizens. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull and goes hunting to find him. Those were the first 5 minutes that are good. What follows after that only gets 100 times worse. Who wrote the screenplay, in my opinion, had to be on some sort of acid drive or something, because otherwise nothing made sense. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary, who takes him. I think Mary should be a Virgin Mary. You know, Jesus' mother. But who knows, I could not make a head or a tail out of it. As they walk, we see villains, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc. ... And all these things are done in ways that make your brain hurt when you want to find out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. It's terrible, I'm telling you, terrible. And in this movie, there are absolutely no bullfights. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I helped some people to waste their time on this film.
