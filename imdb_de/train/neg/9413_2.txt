I do not quite agree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I did not rate it as bad was the great talent of Carmen Miranda. Beginning and end are the best parents because of their talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem lies with the rest of the picture. Alice Faye turns out to be pretty empty. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but his pitiful writing material makes him look so dreadfully hackneyed. <br /> <br /> The plot here is really tough, with Ameche taking two parts as a vocal and dancing man and Baron not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ameche's marriage is getting a second change to rediscovering by playing the song and dance man. Some stupid nonsense about the Baron, who has to do his business and has to be gone, allows him to play both parts. <br /> <br/> S.Z. Sakal has little to do here, and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. The same applies to J. Carrol Naish, who actually appears uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a Chica Chica boom bomb of a movie.
