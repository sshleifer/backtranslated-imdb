OK, I was a big fan of the blacks for a long time and became DISGUSTED after the movie. Let's call the problems ... First, this movie has the same crew that had the first two. It was also called the PREQUEL of the original Black Stallion. Why can not you highlight Shetan's mother correctly or in color? In The Black Stallion Returns we learn that Sagr was the mother of the Blacks CHESTNUT and in this movie she is a gray mare name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it's settled in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first was in the 1940s, when the ship collapsed. The timeline does not sound right for me. There is also a frieze at the beginning of the film, which should be Shetan's father ... at first glance, it seems to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character who makes this movie in any way akin to the previous two. For some, it may be a sweet family movie, but it's my biggest disappointment in the movie of the year.
