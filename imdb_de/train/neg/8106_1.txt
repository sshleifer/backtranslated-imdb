Why do Americans and naughty actors posing as Czechs have to speak perfect English with a false Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed the unfounded nudity - but a gentle porn strip would have more of it and at least would not pretend to be artistic. All political statements were painfully didactic. has the director heard of subtlety? The drama was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. The characters were very shallow and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> I only laughed when they cut the actors in archive footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to adjust the footage - just ridiculous. I read a lot of Kundera's short stories (not The Unbearable Lightness of Being), and there are good things about his writing style (though his themes are a big male fantasy) - and I have to say, the film did not teach the goodness of the Kunderas style with himself.
