I hated the way Ms. Perez portrayed Puerto Rican! We are not all Ghetto - and we speak Spanish, not Puerto Rico. I can not speak for the uneducated you encountered. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is economically better than any other Caribbean island! I am glad that we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of American influence? Free in true poverty, not in the American standard of poverty. We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our lineage has strong African roots, but no "black" roots - I have nothing to do with the Black Americans (the research). The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could not be out of the lane. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free. Che Guevarra helped Castro Create today's Cuba. Is that why a boat full of Cubans risked their lives to come to America? Because Che made a better place for her? You had a great, great, smart idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things we can be proud of as a people - do not discredit our people by falling prey to us. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your views. I am a Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am no victim and have achieved many of my goals in America. If there is a second part in the future - less politics, more history, more stories of victory - then there are many. Damaris Maldonado
