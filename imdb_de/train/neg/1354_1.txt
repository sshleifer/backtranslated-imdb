I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan and I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glovers movie is outrageous. He basically uses the mentally handicapped. Shirly Temple is not just the anti-Christ (which I admit is a bit funny), he challenges the mentally challenged opponents to kill each other, there is also an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​falling in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally handicapped. PETA and human rights should be omnipresent in this matter. It's not a counterculture, as Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
