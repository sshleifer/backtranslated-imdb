This is one of those films where you want to see the time you have looked at, and then some, such as the time you accidentally chose, the time you spent visiting the video store, and so on. <br /> <br /> First of all the look: It is grainy, the budget is low. Well, that does not make a bad movie. But as it was filmed, the action seems unnatural, which distracts. <br /> <br /> Then the story. 3 girls go away from boys on a weekend. Like EVERYONE on a camping trip, they of course stop to get some earrings. When they arrive in the area where they will be staying, they are attracted by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a burning cigarette out of the car during the fire season, and then drives them to where they went are (a distant cabin). Of course, 2 "cute boys" walk close to her and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately enthusiastic, but apparently Bambi is fascinated by something with two legs. Mady is quite disappointed with this development because she was looking forward to spending a weekend in which she had forgotten her ex by dressing with her friends and meeting them. Oh, and I almost forgot, There's a mean old recluse who lives like that, maybe someone that you can not make friends with, and the environment and cabin they're in has a kind of "reputation" , <br /> <br /> So of course Sooner or later (unfortunately, much later), some of our wood visitors die on the weekend and find various booby traps (although some of them were actually hit lower), and of course the rest of the campers are understandably annoyed. Of course, no cell phone reception (who would miss the chance to check his phone in a movie on reception?). Mr. Ranger Sir always appears at odd times and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he said he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic twist that you do not want to miss when you're still awake. Pray that you wake up to a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible, the production values ​​are terrible and the whole company is just lame and I find it amazing that it has even been released. Avoid 1 in 10 at any price.
