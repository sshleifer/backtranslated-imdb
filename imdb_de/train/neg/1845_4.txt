Losing Control is another offer in the erotic thriller genre that can be considered as the "pulp fiction" of the movie world. As a rule, this is a detour to murderous intentions, which are interspersed with copious undressing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is made by amazingly beautiful women who live without exception in this apparent world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering from a writer's block. By chance (or?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery), who enters into more and more risky sexual encounters with her. The man refuses to disclose information about himself, but Kim refuses to end the matter. Her agent Alexa (Anneliza Scott) believes it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most movies of this kind, the resolution is nearing the end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of movie to think, so no change there - but I like it. They are so unpretentious. <br /> <br /> The performance of the performers varies. Doug Jeffery wears the movie as a psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good, but does not convince as a woman in danger. Clay Greenbush as PI did not convince. <br /> <br /> Finally, a reference to the DVD, which is currently being tested. Both the cover and the disc give R-rated and runtime as 93 minutes, but the running time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes seem cut off and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is too short just before getting started. 4 stars
