It touches a few interesting points. - There is no evidence for all "exclusive" studies shown. Who are the "friends" and "small groups of scientists" who collected this data? - What's wrong with the Al Gore biography going on there? For example, how he liked to play with the cows on the ranch or that his child was hit by a car .. too bad, but ... what does that have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I have seen much better material in much less time on Discovery Channel .. I really do not understand why that on IMDb has such a high score. If you have not lived under a rock, this "documentary" should not be news to you ... all old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is get some popularity points. P.S. I am not an American, so do not even try to say that I am a bush fan: p
