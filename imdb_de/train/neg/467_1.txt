There are bad movies, horrible movies and even boring movies ... I can watch the most and endure to the end, not this time. Avoid it like the plague, annoying music everywhere, awful cuts, no comedy, it's stickier than a novelty cup. Chick Strip It was the first time she asked me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, they were not great (Denise made OK in Starship Troopers and Wild Dings), but you've sunk the gravel I feel like a cup that spent 30 minutes with it has ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after many structural works on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice if you do not want to waste valuable oxygen and brain cells on the rattling minced meat that is on your screen.
