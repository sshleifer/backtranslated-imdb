I have only seen the first 30 minutes of it and it was totally crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was BAD a hundred times. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director of all time, but that's not true. The idiot who directed this trash is the WORST director. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "police station" on the wall. There is a fist fight where the punches around TEN FEET are clearly missed. <br /> <br /> This policeman removes women, ties them up and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his policeman to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse with a travel bag. The cop may say something is wrong, that his partner might be a bad cop murdering these women, but he's not sure if that happens because - he's an idiot! The dialogue is totally stupid, the acting is terrible and the characters behave as stupid as I have ever seen on the screen. It is perfectly obvious to the cop's partner that he illegally abducts these women and beats them and takes them to a warehouse and returns to the car with a duffel bag with a body, and yet the partner who is there does not know what's going on is! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie after 30 minutes because I could not stand it anymore. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely VALUABLE.
