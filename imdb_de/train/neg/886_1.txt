A few years ago, the same people who created Paris have J'TAIME. That was imperfect but very enjoyable (my rating was 7), this dump was created over New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) has created a feeling for Paris and it has been produced in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this latest movie, I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel like I was in my birthplace. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 boroughs, I have not seen any scenes in the Bronx or Queens. There's a scene in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach) I've seen No scenes at Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes of beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a large cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were cartoons of the lowest kind. The very few humorous moments are of course sexual or offensive to many fine New Yorkers we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the 'razzie' were far better. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (from 4)) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my mindset, I think the title should have been. <br/> <br/> NEW YORK, I hate you.
