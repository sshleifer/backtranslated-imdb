Every now and then I'll rent an action / adventure movie to relax and do nothing important. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but that makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One day I'll probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to be entertained without any restrictions. For the most part I got what I wanted. The plot was something of a poorly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's play was very collaborative (not bad for a professional kickboxer and a lay actress). The cyborgs had some highlights. Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors for the bad guys - unfortunately most die pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts films, the further you get into the movie, the more emphasis it is on, and the plot (which was not strong at first) deteriorates almost as fast as acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devotes to her butt. At the end of the movie, I seriously thought about watching it a second time, just to count how many times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were in the middle of the screen. Unfortunately, there was simply not enough meat film to see the satisfying curiosity of the movie a second time. If you're a hardcore fan of Xena who has a few hours to do something - be sure to go to the supermarket and spend the .50 cents on the rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect to enjoy yourself for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you like Kathy Longs Derri√®re. THEN you might want to buy a copy.
