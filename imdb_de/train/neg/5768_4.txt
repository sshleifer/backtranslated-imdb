Well, I was excited to download an animated open source movie first, but it was ruined by a demo roll. The animation is excellent, the lip-synching is awful and you see the movie hoping to understand what's going on just to realize that nothing is happening. They do not feel emotions for the characters, just compassion for the creators because they waste their time. I have seen short films with twice as much emotion in half the time! This could be an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a true director. I'm sure everyone at Blender is excited to present their software and rendering capabilities, but I'm sorry to tell the boys' story.
