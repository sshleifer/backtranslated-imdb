A film from this period - extremely long sequences without dialogue, bad flashbacks and an almost exclusively male occupation. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. O'Toole captivates whenever he speaks; Unfortunately, he spends a lot of time peeking through the bushes. Alastair Sims is always a pleasure to see, but he is also used terribly little. <br /> <br /> The film has another positive aspect: it shows many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (eg the casual) appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of , Too many of today's World War II films portray the Allies as all good and the Axes as all evil when history tells us that people are far more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie for when you are recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and can not record anything too complex. If you just need some time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.
