I never thought that a movie could be so disgusting, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible spectacle, terrible plot, terrible effects. The Crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex / killing scene in one, this was a bad move from the start. It was really shocking and that is not a compliment! How can anyone make this movie, watch it, and then really say, "Yeah, that's a good movie, people will see that."
