This is an in-name-only sequel to "A Christmas Story," originally titled "A Summer Story." Ralphie tells his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity does not follow. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. This one is just stupid and not funny at all. Charles Grodin's last movie - no wonder! It is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything formulates everything, and you have to wonder why they bothered at all. And I mean, come on - a competition with gyros ?! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
