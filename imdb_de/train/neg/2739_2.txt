I have no idea what this was filmed on, but you can definitely say they had no budget. Bad drama, horrible cinematography and lurking plot as well as some decent special effects do not make a good movie. WWF-style Cinemtography makes you cry ... where is the tripod ?! The filmmakers aimed high, but missed their target painfully.
