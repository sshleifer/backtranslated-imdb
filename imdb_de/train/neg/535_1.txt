Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous. Not painful to see with your partner? I apologized to my friend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and awfully strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for it, especially with Vanessa, who made that ridiculous, hard American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the strange, awkward girl she wore in my so-called life. It does not have to crowd in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend I'm crying! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the few redeeming parts of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes and I swear to God, she stretched out the movie screen and struck me awake. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better and better when I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, this was a well-filmed movie, it was very pretty, the attire was nicely dressed and relieved the intense boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's just rather pitiful when a movie with a cast of "The Best Actresses of Our Time" is so shitty. It certainly had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a jerk. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's girlfriend - mainly because these two ladies were better actors and I felt a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Bad job, evening the movie. They were not entertaining and they did not even make you think. I really hope the book was better, so it did not waste more time. 3.10
