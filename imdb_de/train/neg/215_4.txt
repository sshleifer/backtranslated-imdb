I do not like Love Sick as much as I imagine. Finally, the film expressed the sexual relationship between Alex, Kik and Sandu, their love triangle was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, when Alex finally woke up and realized that she would have no result and no future. The surfacing was sad <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on the 08.10.06 at 12.00, and we watched the movie together. After the film, he told the audience that the intention to make this film, which was meant to express the sexual relations of Romanian, was a complication of some sort. <br /> <br /> In my view, the sex life is always complicated, everywhere feel no special impression and effect from the film. The love affair of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were a kind of neighborly story next door. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why I do not like this movie are the movie told us how they fell in love? Sounds like Alex moved into the building where Kiki lived, then two girls fell in love. It makes no sense at all. How would a girl fall in love with another girl than with a man? Too many fragments, you have to represent and connect these stories according to your ideas. Second, the whole movie had no scene with Alex and Kiks intercourse, so I waited ???? However, there were still some parts to recommend. The "ear piercing" part was kind of interesting. Alex was ready to suffer the ear piercing pain to acknowledge Kik's love. That was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​her love. The scene in which they lay on the football field also expressed the conversation that their loved ones were honest and passionate.
