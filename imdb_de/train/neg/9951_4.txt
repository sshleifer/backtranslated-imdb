Johnny and Jeremy are vampires. Without the fangs of course. They are dark, bitter creatures who can do no better than spread their own misery. By their charm (namely a sharp tongue and a thick wallet) they seduce desperate souls who torture and make victims. This is more or less the basis for this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine how the public is interested in the internet dirty, main character. However, I enjoyed the sound and the melody of the fast (and supposedly very funny) remarks. I was very impressed by the strong cast of the cast, especially David Thelis. Only the character of Jeremy seemed too two-dimensional. The photography and the music, both dramatic and gloomy, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really scares me off "Naked" (and the main reason why I would never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly portrays misogyny as a valid way to relieve anxiety , In other words, what difference does it make in a world that is so bad at inflicting pain on girls, right? To claim (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so rude to a person because he's not as rough as Jeremy on girls is completely absurd. They are both terrible, bad people. And they are especially interested in hurting women every time they have a chance. One could argue that Johnny gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung back and bit his ass. His and Jeremy's sadistic behavior, however, is treated to some degree as a laugh theme. I could be wrong, but I suspect that most people who absolutely love this movie also find this aspect of the movie darkly funny.
