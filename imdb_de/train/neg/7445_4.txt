Extremely boring drama with a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and the only reason is to even see the movie. With bright, overbearing music and weighted dialogue, this is one of the endless movies that bores you to the point of nagging headaches. The sober sequel to "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka," in which McDowall trains the next generation of nags, is slightly better than the original, but the tempo remains slow, and the score still puts you in submission to a scene or two do not trigger a coma.
