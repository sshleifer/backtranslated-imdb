Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, the "dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize", which dissolves the poo when spraying chicken manure. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize is a real product, so I can spray it on this "stinker" of a movie and blow it up. <br /> <br Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (this honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it does deserve a short second's honor. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, nothing. A real "stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
