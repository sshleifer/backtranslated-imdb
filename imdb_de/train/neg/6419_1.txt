Remember the end of the Grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cuts himself - and a scary mirror <br / > <br /> OH AND UNDERWATER SEA PETS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie ... I really did not enjoy it. The poster for the movie is also very misleading and I've found that it was just about getting people to look at it. I can not believe that I left. <br /> <br /> Save time and money ... look at Saw III ... a movie that makes you feel like you're having trouble ... <br /> <br / > Mike and I are out
