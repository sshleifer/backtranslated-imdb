I saw it at the UCSB Role Festival and was * shocked * that it won the Golden Reel Award. I was not the only one, considering that the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better movies, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted in film theory and other artistic matters. While cinematography and editing are comparable to many other short films on the market, storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems that "serious" student films should include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and ultimately suicide - Nick and Kate out and all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and it could be the opinion of my outsider, but the guy from Montecito sounds a bit fake. Does someone else have such a thing?
