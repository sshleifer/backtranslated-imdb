Clich√©-ridden story of an upcoming divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corny dialogues, cardboard figures, brood situations, a red herring zombie negotiation and, worst of all, absolutely no reward, neither emotional nor dramatic. <br /> <br /> Does not anyone teach creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak narrator - if you can not come up with a satisfactory solution - end the story. I am forced to ask, "What made you think that this is worth a story worth telling?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted debut of child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was memorable at best. And they wonder why nobody watches indie movies! This is ninety minutes of my life that I will never get back.
