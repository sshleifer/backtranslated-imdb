Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a bit amusing in this 1970's turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even the youth of Goldie Hawn (shortly after her Oscar win) can not start this piece out of the mud to draw. As a rock-chasing celebrity in his 40s, Sellers usually torments to the nth degree. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10 points. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young study type. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers got paid well because I see no other reason for trips in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH), HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE SIMPLE PIECES and many others). You can not win them all!
