I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and the movie were a rip-off from Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he was Olivier, and Reeves wishes he was Caine. Caine even had the courage to make a remake of Sleuth, with Jude Law playing his original role. Jude Law? You mean the one who made the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This film was written during a career of Caine, when it was obvious that he had to pay the gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award-winning films as this and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure. What the praise for this movie seems to be is the death of Reeves. He deserves to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with jewels like "The Island" and "Blame on Rio".
