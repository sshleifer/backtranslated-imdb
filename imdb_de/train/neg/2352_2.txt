Raw, sometimes crass - for me this is the summary of Madhur Bhandarkar's recent work - page 3. He has no point of view - only superficial, funny digs on stereotypes. What's the movie about? Is it about reporting a clan of people (so-called guys) who are so busy socializing and improving their profile in life that they have no time for anything else? And you are either in or out. Is there no press at all to report everyday occurrences? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and is just a supplement; Maybe an entertainer to find out who is who and what is. Do not mix the two. And then there is power play - that would happen in every area of ​​life. So, what did you say in the end - nothing - just some rough jokes that string together in an otherwise directionless movie.
