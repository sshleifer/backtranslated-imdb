Oh, great god. This movie ... it was awful. I'm a huge fan of horror movies. And mostly horror movies say other people are bad, I like it. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was incredible, I'll say that. But this conspiracy was terrible. It did not make sense! It had way too much gore and at first an unnecessary (and disgusting) sex scene. I think the director was trying to be "shocking" or something, but it just turned out to be terrible. To add to the pile of eager crap they called a conspiracy, the actors (besides "scarecrow") were terrible, and I cared so little that I soon forgot who was who. Finally, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, please do so.
