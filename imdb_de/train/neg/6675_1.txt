This weekend I saw "28 Weeks Later", which was very good. After that I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you that it is one of the most boring so-called horror you could ever see. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the fight scenes are mild compared to a schoolyard fight. And to make matters worse, guy Cody had an uncontrollable, loose, dirty tongue that distracted attention from the main movie. Forget this movie. I would rather look 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
