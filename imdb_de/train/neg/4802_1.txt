I give this marriage 3 years and that stretches it. Adrianne Curry's mouth is dirty, rotten, controlling, loud, and her sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has an image he needs to protect, and that he has to avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has a low self esteem and a different time distortion. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not be happy after the end. Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to regain his youth. Here are two very good people who will end up in an unpleasant divorce. I do not think his old "Brady family" fits into his new life. I see that they are excluded. Chris said his friends are more important than his family. He supported him and was there for him.
