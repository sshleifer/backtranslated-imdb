This movie is just way too long and far too often, and male nudity and sexuality (as they are known as gays with my own collection of adult titles) is far too free and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been reduced to ten minutes and was just as effective without trying the patience (and perseverance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon with a film festival audience; The kind of audience that is more adventurous is more interested in more experimental or atypical films, eg. Without dialogues, short films or foreign films. The nearly sold-out crowd in a 275-seat theater began to dribble in the first half of the movie, and while the vast majority remained for the pay-off (which never actually arrived), I have not done so in 14 years seen from a number of film festivals, experimental, gay and other, so many people are leaving a movie. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been reduced by more than half and was as effective as it was. It could have gone in other directions, with even shorter running times and far more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, this is not something that can be readily recommended or that I would like to see again.
