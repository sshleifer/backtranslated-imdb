Perhaps the most beautiful and sexiest woman in show business is doing another good job here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, it's still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with typical Melrose Place types, chiseled facial features and seductive curves that I've never seen before. Apart from Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had previously seen in the similar Delta Delta Die. The storyline revolves around a group of Californian arrogans who inaugurate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club and that she has to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she falls in love with her joke. <br /> <br /> INJURY: $ $$$$ (plentiful! Debbie Rochon has occasionally injected blood on her, and all the murder scenes are done on her face.) Gore dogs will certainly be pleased!) <br/> < br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Also plentiful!) Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes like many unnamed actors and actresses - the pool party just seems like an excuse to get everyone naked, man and woman alike - Julie Strain also has a topless cameo except her character is gone after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Could have gotten a higher voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a filler between nude scenes.) I understand that at B-rate movies, nudity is common However, this is overly limitless. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Acting is, to say the least, Rochon is always at The Best B-rate Actress in Today's Economy, but Her Character in American Nightmare was superior, Danny Wolske did a great job as a Debbie object of desire, but the other actors were not something to write about.
