I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit, it was not my cup of tea. Although it is supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But when I looked at it, I thought ... 'This movie makes no sense at all ...' Where does this guy in the dark coat come from? Where did they go when they left the girls behind? Where did a shark come from? <br /> <br /> All these elements in this movie did not fit in any way. I felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a movie that was supposed to be so shitty. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I said I would not look at it again. So much pappy show in this movie, I decided to give it a thumbs down! Count me out! 0 out of 10!
