This movie has a lot of great adult stars, but it does not interest you what an adult movie should look like. Among all the stars you could not see any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream-like medieval set that is embarrassingly cheesy. Acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as hearing a neighbor over his kid in college, and the dialogue is the worse I've seen in a movie. The plot was ten times worse. I would stay on the amateur track. The audio commentary was useless, since it is a skin film, but also that was bad. Unless you are a diehard Jenna Jameson fanatic. There is little here. 4.10
