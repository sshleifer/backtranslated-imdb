This stuffy melodrama is by far the worst movie I've ever seen with Ingrid Bergman. Even her glowing screen presence can not save this unbearably slow and meandering movie, which is almost impossible to sustain unless much of it is rewound. others will most likely fall asleep. I suggest you apply instead "For whom the bell".
