This is really a very bad movie. Why? At first the story is bad. It's an artificial story that connects all sorts of things that make no sense. It just seems like a wrong experiment. Second, the actors can not play realistically. You can not even speak as an actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what do I have to do with it now?
