Oh, that was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is fine, but I think she's bitchy about the movie, not because she's being ripped out of her body by a raven at night, but because she's thinking about firing her agent because he's her stuck in this crap. Faye Dunaway acts as if she's going to make Mommy Dearest a new one, and the end is completely stupid. I really can not recommend this movie, even though I was fascinated as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe a bit by the clues to his work (Ravens, House of Usher-like family curse and buried alive) would probably turn around in the grave if he was from this Movie would know.
