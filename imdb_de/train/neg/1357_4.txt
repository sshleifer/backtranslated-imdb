* can contain a kind of spoiler? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek panties in a pile. His pioneering appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has locked him forever in the American conscience. More recently, he has tried to return to the cult subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> But this time, Crispin shot a 76-minute, cheap Dada movie. Sometimes it reminded me of genius, though it almost offended me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? is a movie in which all actors have Down syndrome in one half of the movie, giving the movie a freak show feel. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. All this had the feel of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time felt more successful and failed. <br /> <br /> Half of Down syndrome actors also have many slugs killed. It's about a guy who has snails and kills one at the end. He is also tormented by some other people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with two girls with whom he has sex in a cemetery. He also has an altercation with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He's something of control over the guy's mind, and the guy with cerebral palsy is something of sexuality. Well, he is masturbated at least in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" pictures that are made witty, such as Nazi Swaztikas and Shirley Temple, and black-faced minstrels who say they love Michael Jackson, slugs to be killed and beaten by the other people. They hit him with stones and stuff. Later they beat the minstrel after they have brought him to justice. Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> What is it? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari and has more than a passing style that was stolen from him. The claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the no-wall sets of Dr. Ing. Caligari were claustrophobic. They also had a dialogue that was completely nonsensical. And it was all packed with absurdistic humor images. <br /> <br /> The problem is, about 20 minutes after the movie ... maybe a bit more ... What is it? The imagery goes out. Over the next 56 minutes, we keep running with the same pictures and only present new pictures in the form of an absurd puppet show. The film seems little more than a film trying to push the envelope in offensive and taboo images. It tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that there are only enough different pictures for a 40-minute movie. Worse, cinematography, scenery and everything else felt very cheap and almost unplanned. It felt like "OK, so we can do it and get it out of the way." It did not feel interesting and was pretty boring. On the other hand, Dr. Caligari an amazing cinematography and imaging. The difference between the two is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
