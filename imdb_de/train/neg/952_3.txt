Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent of all, including the audience. The ease of the false identity and faux scandal plotting of the old hat is unforgivable. Very few people watched these films for their plans. Usually they had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreographies and breathtaking dances and catchy songs. Do not go happy. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead star played the whole movie as a second banana, desperately looking for a star who played it - and instead she had to wear the film and could not. The Scottish area was wasted. Normally omnipresent Scottish whims are missing automatically. The photograph was pedestrian. The music numbers were pedestrians. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance and chews the scenery, as no one else has done his part, in the kind of producer role often played by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and nobody could do David Niven like David Niven. If you love Niven as much as I do at the end of the day, it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
