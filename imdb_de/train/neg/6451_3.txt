"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin site where his twin brother Wes has disappeared. While they are there, a reptile creature in the guise of a man (very much reminiscent of the Gillman of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) in the wilderness awaits the right time to select them one by one. Kat (Chase Masterson), a biker, the timeless wife of Ellen Ripley, has an underground military bunker where she practices experiments, and at the same time serves as a place of safety before the bloody thing. Kat knows more than she tells (she has also suffered the loss of a child), but there is another novelty most of the groups have no idea about. This creature could only be more human than they realize ... and their former identity could shed some light on a delusion that only another person has hidden since Wes' death. Kat holds the key to many of the secrets that come loose when the group stays near the cabin. Fortunately, much of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air, while we also see a hazy screen when we look through his eyes. The film features Dawson's Creek melodrama, which often obstructs any real suspense that must be built into a small monster movie. The direction is very mild, resulting in a relatively boring experience rather than fear. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. The pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) could be the only draw for this movie.
