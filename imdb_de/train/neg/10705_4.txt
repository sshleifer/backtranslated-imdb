Outsider cop with family issues and his gun? Check! Isolated location with valuable object to be stolen? Check! Tasty-looking love interest? Check! Different bands of thick carton gun food villains with dodgy European accents? Check! German-sounding villain, played by an English actor, with a tiny dialogue for every occasion? Check! Corny One Liner? Check! <br /> <br /> Dear Sirs, Does this film take the smallest or what? The clichés are as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the performers just stand around and wonder how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a very cheap and happy video demo just from Die Hard Auf dem Berg (with some notched lines from the points above), we've taken all the usual steps of the progressive cliché of the action step, while we proceed with good old-fashioned violence and nudity to wake everyone who has just nodded off. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the policeman who is in full John McClane mode, even making the time for the ancient villain with gun who has used his entire bullet in one place. In the midst of this chaos there is a few familiar, recognizable faces that I can only assume that they need the money and / or just played it to laugh from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot the concluding implausible ending with rupey dialog and even ropier effe cts. <br /> <br /> When I look up these three pounds from the supermarket bargain market for IMDb, I am amazed when this guy has spawned not just one but two sequels. I have to find these jewels on DVD! It looks like the first sequel is a rip-off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel. One thing that's always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with every movie, and even the character's name seems to change for the third part. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the blind purchase of cheap DVDs would simply not be the case. The same is true if the studios do not always produce material of this terrible quality !!
