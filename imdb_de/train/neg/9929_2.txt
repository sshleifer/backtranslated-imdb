It was like watching a big mackerel hit in the face over and over again. Even if you thought, "That mackerel will not be able to come back", * gossip * there it was. I'm not sure what they think. This is the kind of pilot I was looking at and asked myself, "Did the actors know they were on a convicted ship destined never to be made into a series?" Not only black clichés, but also Swedish and Indian. And while "Blazing Saddles" made these clichés a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these clichés were downright offensive. There was no plotline, the end was struck and the jokes were not. If you are a student of comedy, you should watch this pilot to see what you should not do.
