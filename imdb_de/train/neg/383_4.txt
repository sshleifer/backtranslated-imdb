The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is quite interesting. But as we watched this movie, we said aloud, "These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, make-up and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was confused and the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story with some of the same actors would have been worth working on as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I can not repeat it enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate yourself more to the good sound. Sound is just as much a part of a movie as the image, and it's worth it to get it right. Could have earned a 6.
