I knew that my summary would get you. How is this movie like a pet rock and disco ?! Well, if you did not go through the 70s or 80s, you probably can not understand why someone wants to own a New Coke or a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I do not quite understand that yet). These are just a few things that made sense at the time, but really amaze the younger generation. The same goes for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (mostly in the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough punch that the studio played them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this movie. However, if you did not live at that time (it was long before my time), ask yourself why this kind of "entertainment" has fallen. After all, Kyser and his bandmates are incredibly disgusting and their humor is very, very broad (ie uncomplicated and cheesy). Honestly, I could not stand her antics and did not know that there were just too many musical numbers in the movie. Due to these factors, the great supporting actor has been pushed into the background and fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her crazy aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange events begin. Finally, it culminates in some attempts to Sally's life and a kind of s√©ance. It's all made to laugh - and despite the cast, it's really not a horror movie. All in all, this is a passable conversation. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I felt really cheated when I had to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads.
