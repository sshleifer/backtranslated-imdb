As someone who has read the book, I can say that this is far inferior to the big American version with Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for that. First, Emma is too uncomfortable. Yes, she has flaws and is not the simplest person you can like, but the onlooker should not begin to despise her. Second, Mr. Knightly is an abuse. His pondering and melancholy in this version lend themselves better to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen and "throw off" the mood of the whole affair. Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be assigned to the role of Harriet. and why did she have to look so sick? Harriet is said to be blond and blooming - not looking like she's getting carried away with consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was mixed up and scenes cut. In the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr. Knightly, it seems very puzzling, because this narrative was not sufficiently shown and supported in the film. Fifth, what exactly happened to Mrs. Elton's accent? She did not sound like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at first, turning all Americans half way through and then back to English. In the end, this was pulled in the end. The book and the big movie ending with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightly. This version gets confusing after announcing the wedding, without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, a rather random experiment. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
