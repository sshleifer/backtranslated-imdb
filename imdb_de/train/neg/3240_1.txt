This is the first Guinea Pig movie from Japan and I think that is the sickest. A few guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point I would like to say that these films are NOT genuine! These are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting, but in many cases unrealistic. For example, when they kick the girl in the ground, we can clearly see them stepping on the floor near the girl and getting dull! And how stupid that looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and make no sense. Other scenes are animal casts thrown at the girl, the girl was exposed to loud noises for many hours, the tearing of fingernails, worms on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in terrible details and the like. Very sick and mean movie and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematic. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig, though it's not as bloody as the next one, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible. Guinea Pig: Devil's The experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen and closest to the snuff. This is (of course) still a fake (n / t) uff, the only difference to the real "snuff movie" is that in this movie nobody really dies or hurts. I can not recommend it to anyone, as it is so repellent and repulsive. Those who consider this a great horror movie understand nothing about the cinema and its real meaning. I saw this as curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how trivial the garbage is. They only work in shock and that is not too valuable cinematic performance. Devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I've ever seen, and Mermaid in Manchole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So that's pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
