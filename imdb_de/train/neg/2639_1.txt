Let's start this review with the fact that I just signed up to write the review and warn people to save their money! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst things I've seen since The Hulk. The plot was the most predictable garbage imaginable. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, immediately flush this expectation along with the money you would use for a ticket down the toilet. You can have more fun that way. The drama was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" at the end.) I have to say that, the end surprised me, I'm not referring to the storyline that surprised me, but rather The effortless way setting up the ONLY scene with some decent action throughout the movie, the end sped up so fast that I did not even know it was over until I saw the credits roll and at that point I thought about that Burning a movie role, if only I could figure out how to get into this screening room. <br /> <br /> Casting was horrible for several reasons: First, they must have accidentally changed character assignments because Michael Douglas played the role, CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing: Douglas sneaking around agents, making phone calls, hooking up with systems d chasing people who chase after him, Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is constantly capable of advertising humor, even if things are not going so badly for him. He plays a very sober agent, nothing to do with his Jack Bauer guy we love 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can only promise you that this film will be disappointed in all areas. It can best be compared to a remake of "The Fugitive", written by people with intellectual disabilities
