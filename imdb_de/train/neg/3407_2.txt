OK, forget about the technical inconsistencies or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle, which are accidentally started by a quirky robot with a golden heart. Forget the vile special effects and poorly constructed one-dimensional characters. I'm just looking at the premise of the story. The reason why the movie even exists and you will see how bad this movie was put together. I know 9-year-olds who consider this insult of intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is terrible. The spectacle is funny and the message it tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse, the cable movie channels show the show! It's on twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone who understands that people want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times, let alone even see it? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is that you do not bother to expend the energy for this thing. It's just not worth it.
