This movie reminds me of how students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if some kids in Cow Dung Collehe were giving up cheeseburgers, they would immediately change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the concept of a policy is dangerous. If the USSR and the US go to war, this could mean the end of the WORLD. The US and the USSR never went to war. <br /> <br /> If we had only conventional weapons, the idea of ​​another war, a "profitable" war in Europe and Asia would not be unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a prime example of "not making a movie". <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
