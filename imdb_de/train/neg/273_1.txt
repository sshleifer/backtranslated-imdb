The mark of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is not a cabarnet and certainly not a Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that plagues us tonight in sit-coms and the dialogue is nurturing and preaching. But let's take a look at the obsolete theme of the film. <br /> <br /> With more than sixty years of history, wisdom comes along. The author Lillian Hellman has since "Watch on the Rhine" as Bidenesker plagiarist with her so-called "Julia" series from her book "Pentimento" unmasked. As one of the most disgusting of a variety of Western USSR apologists it is obvious that their theme in the game and the film was to make America act, to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the just proven fascists military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one critic rightly noted, this is not a pro-American game and a movie because Lillian, an American despicable communist, went to her grave. The film tells of the familiar selfish stupidity of the intellectual elites that formed the American left, just as the full moon of Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore interfered in the conspiracy theories and once again helped those who would do so and comfort granted destroy America
