I really wanted to see this movie and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, I threw it directly into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which drove me crazy. I give every movie a chance, even if I want to go out of the theater, / press "Stop". I looked it all the way through, but got nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very, very good, but that's about it. Nothing is explained; While we understand that Mathieu is depressed and ends up in some psychiatric ward, we never have any insight into his "downfall." While we understand that he and Cedric are separating, we do not see it or WHY. In an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric tells him that he once cheated on him, but that was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no - nothing. We also get the hint that Cedric was the one who took Mat to the hospital - but again, we do not see it, but this movie really hit me. When Pierre, Cedric's ex, shows up in the club and causes trouble, we do not see any hiding or hair from him until the end, and it took me a long time to find out that Pierre was the ex. His personality in the club and when Mat finds him is totally different. I might even be wrong in saying that, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The movie expects you to know everything and move at its disjointed, inappropriate and confusing pace. I can keep up with movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies with flashbacks / flash forwards on the left and right, but CU did not capture the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane' you know what's going on and discover the answer to the most important secrets. CU just lets you hang. There is a touch of presumption in his presentation "We will not tell you anything damned, find out for yourself". It's like reading a book with chapters changed and pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.
