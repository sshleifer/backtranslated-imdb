Maybe because I was so young, innocent, and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the reason for many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school. I'm not sure what impact it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me ... and on most of my friends. It has served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and competent enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly afraid of what the newly converted Christians would have to endure after the Rapture if they did not get the mark of the beast. I do not want to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention any details of the scenes, but I can still picture them in my head ... and that was 19 years ago.
