I was glad to watch this movie for free because I work in the hotel industry and this movie recently came to our movie library. Nothing against low-budget movies, but this movie has terrible acting and directing. How can a movie like this ever be made? The director should be blacklisted, and for any poor actor it is certainly not a springboard to career. Please make sure you do not see this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and the director terrible. There are only a few more films that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give it to charity, so it has at least a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would see it even 10 (or at least once more).
