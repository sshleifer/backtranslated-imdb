A chemical release turns people into zombies. There are up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's a movie by Andreas Schnaas, so you know what a course the course will be. Bad action, terrible horrible special effects and no budget to talk about. Synchronization is ridiculous with a big R, and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a word about this excrement, let alone the ten lines that are mandatory due to the guidelines set by IMDb. My original review of just one word: Crap would not fly, so I need to revise it and think more about how bad it is. But I do not know if I can do it, so ... I think I may have enough words or lines to pass that review. Which is cool, I think. So in summary: This movie sucks balls, do not look at him. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
