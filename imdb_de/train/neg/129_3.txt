I'm curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity on political / socialism. Whatever the intention of the director, the two do not really fit together. The director just had to stay with the romantic side of Lena and make his own film for politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political / military rallies. King, serious political interviews, hovering breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictitious documentary than a movie. Apart from the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other critics, I think the nude / sex scenes are exaggerated for what they are. If you want to see real porn, there are certainly better options. The piercing nudity is a big distraction from the storyline that exists. I think the cast has done a good job. They credibly played their roles. There is hardly any of the excess that I see so often in American films at this time.
