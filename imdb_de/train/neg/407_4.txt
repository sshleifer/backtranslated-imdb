I love special effects and show new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen most of this movie since it was broadcast on HBO in recent months. I have to admit, I may have missed a few scenes, but I've usually gone to movies and seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see something of "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I'm not sure why; Maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be angry, and that's disappointing. But I think it is a witness of how he becomes relentlessly evil. Anyway, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for kids under 14 (maybe 12 when they're grown up).
