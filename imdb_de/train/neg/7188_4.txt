When I caught a glimpse of the title, I thought we'd get another tough hip-sip, but I actually thought "7eventy 5ive" is an easy passable game and momentum returns for almost 80s after a boring, slow section the last half hour that leads to an outrageously sticky climax and a veritable cop end. It will not win any award for originality as it is as systematic as possible and steals the thriller in the kind of thrill (usual cheap horror fears), location (secluded villa) and motivation from other films. The shiny direction is according to the book and the material is crazy with poorly realized red herrings within its elaborate conspiracy and scant script. Sometimes ridiculous, but nevertheless, I was amused by a psychotic murderer with a battle ax because of his brutal and cruel acts of violence against some rather distasteful college students. The performances were not bad in the form of a young, spooky cast, but the characters they portrayed were not particularly tempting. An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supporting role as a detective. A smooth, but flat and unforgettable addition to the fold.
