I have discovered that this film is rented from the packaging. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you come to the movie and there are women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects ... and even battle scenes you can see them miss beats by 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie for a short time and is worse than the rest of the maniacs in the movie. The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people call him a "cult classic." However, I can not imagine anyone thinking that this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. The real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed that I rented it and vowed never to see a Lommel movie again!
