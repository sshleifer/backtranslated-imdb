REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a big, miserable, grainy clich√©. I would have laughed loud and a lot, but had an appointment with an ex-military. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a shallow "good old boy", I liked. That's not a compliment. I know that one actor wants to work ... good for the others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful taste of Ralph. I only choose a 2 because Ralph looked so stunning. But I have to plead, Ralph, how can you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I will see the end of the affair to heal and recover now. C1
