The abbreviation "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film points to the construction of a "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic, which is to serve as an "Air Station" for transatlantic aircraft flights. Based on a contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; It was shot in German as "F.P.1 does not answer" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon technology has made continuous traveling on oceans preferable. Stars Conrad Veidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) love and sabotage the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl referred. Mr. Veidt is the most fun to see; However, he does not convince in the "love triangle" with Mrs. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and the film did not age well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (3/3/33) Karl Hartl - Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
