I did not like this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie itself would save, at least for me, he would have to pull himself out of the huge hole he had dug. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The two draws of the film were for me Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to interest me in what she would bring to the film. After that, I was simply disappointed in and for all three, though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I can imagine that for each of them it was a very difficult task to find their "moments" given the lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film is by and large so poorly written, staged and edited that an actor's performance as a performer would suffer. I think the disrespectful treatment of sexual abuse and the banal and insulting view of small-town America were the two main reasons why this film did not meet its goal. As a reviewer has noted and I would agree that the film is hardly marketable due to its finished form. I suspect, or at least hope that (for the sake of the actor) some real gems lie on the floor of the cutting room. Sad for us, but if that's true, then the actors can console themselves and feel reasonably good about providing their talents and time for such a flop. Oh yeah and one more thing ... I only wish once that I could see an American movie that contains the sadly vanished but wonderfully bucolic shots, like the ones in this movie where the main characters were not absent and / or the Do not disrespectfully waste land side with pop cans, smashed CDs and other garbage!
