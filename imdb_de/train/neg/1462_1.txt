This could be the worst movie I have ever seen. Despite Mikshelt's claim, this movie is not nearly historically accurate. It starts badly and then it goes downhill. We cursed Hitler's father because he married his niece. They were indeed second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father Alois "Uncle" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and grew up when his son was his nephew when his son grew up. Alois was much older than Klara, and as a child she had become accustomed to calling Alois "uncle." The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out with his dog, it's just a shame and an insult to the intelligence of all spectators. We see Hitler hunting the dog through the ditch, and when he fetches the poor thing, he'll beat it up because he did not obey him. In the distance we see and hear his comrades taunt and chastise the cowardly little man, but then a grenade lands directly on his pursuers, and every last one is, as we are told, completely killed. If Hitler was the only person who survived the scene, then that story was told of brutality and cowardice. Did Hitler let himself be praised? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Next, Hitler harasses a poor, stressed and war-weary Jewish officer who gives him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a pawnbroker before the battle for the Fatherland and had thoughtfully brought some medals from his shop, because I'm sure the Iron Crosses were not shown as in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> Here you can hear all the grotesque clichés, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to drive the Führer's boat out of Richard Wagner's gun than any "flying Dutchman". Hitler could be responsible for the death of ... 60 million people, but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling musical taste? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would be there for hours. <br /> <br /> Miss.
