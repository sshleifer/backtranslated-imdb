To my knowledge, the Largo winds were a famous Belgian comic (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without the life of a spy! So when I had to pick a movie for a 5 year old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a big fan of James Bond! big doubts: If American films offer an amazing start, here no action and a hot sex scene? Then the story becomes very complicated with financial steps. I thought I had lost the child. <br /> <br /> But strangely, he had been caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the great interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? The multi-box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> No idea, but he's really interested in Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
