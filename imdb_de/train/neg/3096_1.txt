First of all, "Hobgoblins" tries to improve the successful "Gremlins". That's bad enough, but they're not trying to do anything very similar to a movie here. It's more like a bargain basement, everything that has to happen to clear embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound effects, as bold as unsophisticated tapioca and a script that records everything that people consider sacred in their films and throw into the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> The story? Grrrr .... Meddling kids discover Gremlin-like creatures from the movie party before killing people by projecting their fantasies. Sounds cool, right? Do you see this wall on the other side of your room? Immediately after, top speed, face first. See, that's cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quick, call something else, which was different to one of the leads. What other scripts have the authors done since "hobgoblins"? Name another direct Rick Sloane trial. How many "hobgoblins" action figures do you have? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it took me so long to write about such a terrible movie. I'd rather write about more important things. such as the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, something like that. But no, "hobgoblins" is and it's bad - bad like your grandparents' wallpapers, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underwear labeled "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think we'll stop <br/> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight bravely, but try, they can do so much with "hobgoblins" before they realize the director has kicked his shin. <br /> Really, really hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
