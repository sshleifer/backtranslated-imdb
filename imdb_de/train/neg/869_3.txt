Where should I start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy I would say it was FANN-TASTIC! Unfortunately, for me and everyone else who had spare time and a little money left (mind you, that was the price I paid and got him from Wal-Mart). The only THRILL I got was to watch Kirkland's lousy interpretation of Anne Wilkes from Misery in a snow-covered forest. If you want a good laugh with some friends on a rainy Friday night, I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to see something that is at least halfway decent, then do not bother. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies, the worse, the better in most cases. But wow ... I mean WOW !! The only person in the entire movie who did not stink was the little boy played by Vincent Berry. The only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
