The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a dreadful episode, it's just hard to track "The Man Who Was Death", "The Whole House" and "Dig This Cat, He's Really Off." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who has just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes, you find out that Charles married Peggy just for her money. The two go on honeymoon, their car collapses on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandoned mansion. Charles soon discovers a secret from Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the other episodes in the first season.
