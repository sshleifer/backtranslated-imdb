Aside from all the technical mistakes .... <br /> <br /> How about a female flight attendant who is capable of killing 4 of the 7 terrorists (including former marines) alone, 2 of them even without a weapon then she lands the plane perfectly. We do not talk about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton. It is a regular, anxious, but very well-trained flight attendant. : D How about the responsible leader of the Assault / Rescue Commando, who (according to the script's script) has complete proof that everyone can sleep and someone from his team makes the plane fly. Only he decides to spontaneously change the plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists to burn weapons, not knowing where the terrorists are or how many, and gaining no advantage so that his entire team easily wipes out , Yes, that's the old noggin. Only later you decide to use the sleep gas anyway. And it turns out to be useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad as this movie was, but I could not help but watch and wonder what's next? : D I can easily imagine that all the excellent, unemployed screenwriters think for themselves, it's not fair. lol! : D
