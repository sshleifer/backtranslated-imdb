May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) apparently visit their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London rarely. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack that leaves Mai, uncertain, and questions her life and future. Darren (Daniel Craig), the friend of her daughter, irresistibly attracts. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but despite her announced realism and praise, The Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even unpleasant characters to dismiss and challenges the viewer to engage with them. Reid shines like May, and it is her skill and dedication as a wonderfully understated actress who saves the film from a completely depressing swamp, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such highly repulsive characters as do will be hard to take care of what happens with May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually so selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what Kureishi actually wanted to say. They are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula across the two-dimensional in their ghastly selfishness. <br /> <br /> Interesting for Reid's performance, but little else. A crying shame ...
