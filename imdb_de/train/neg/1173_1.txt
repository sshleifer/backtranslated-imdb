If I had only one camera accidentally glued to the floor, had enough film for just one shot of each shot, then lost the whole movie and had to spend a couple of dollars to buy some digital video tapes to buy one over 2 -hour movie about the French Revolution, which also had no sets and had my 4-year-old autistic son painting the backgrounds, and the only actors I could find were the people who did not mind. I do the audition of the soap opera of the year, and I was also forced to use no music in the entire movie, and the camera's zoom function did not work either, unless it started to zoom in accidentally and could not. I stop, oh, and if I hated my audience, then I could do something like that terrible, but inadvertently funny, infernal waste of time. The almost magnificent-looking but totally bogus backdrops reminded me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it much more disappointing, because throughout the movie the little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would do it's peak in a lightsaber Duel / space laser fight. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but it does not end like that. The only thing that occurred to me that wasting more time than watching this movie was writing this review. Peace.
