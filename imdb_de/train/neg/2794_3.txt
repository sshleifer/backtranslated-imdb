Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll watch this movie on TMC, nothing else good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half done. I seriously thought that this is one of those soft-core movies, with shabby plot and acting, grumpy movies and lousy effects. But no, I do not even have the pleasure. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I had hoped to have a few laughs, but I was not sure if they wanted to throw inliners or not. But now I have to sit here watching the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I'm sitting here and typing until I have 10 lines
