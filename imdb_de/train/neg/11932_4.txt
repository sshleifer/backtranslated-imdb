Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner in Nemesis, a pretty good science fiction movie. When we saw that, we quickly moved through the BS drama parts to get to the incredible action sequences. Gruner loves kicks, kicks and kicks. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner is a student forced to stay in a ghetto where he grew up in the Mexican gang that constantly torments his family. Instead of joining in, Gruner challenges the boy to defend himself (against a gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character that kills everyone (or makes them pretty bad) and works to free his block from those gang members. The plot was very cheesy and easy to think. Gruner is probably not very well known because he chose the script to see if this movie is a comparison. This ghetto is hell and I enjoyed watching the colorful crew of characters go through as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typical action music (pounding pianos and timpani, broken guitars), which was not as bad as I would sound. The director really needed to keep the action going rather than pausing for a tense family moment every 5 minutes. Finally, I gave him a 4/10 because he had really tried to be an average action movie for Oliver Gruner as the lead actor, but the overall feel of the movie lets you close what you've just seen.
