His spelling S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her breasts. That was pretty tight. Before and after the movie blows pretty much. The drama is like an e-list and is well shown in the movie. Not to mention that the budget is so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of a decent movie. The only other reason why I liked the movie was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. If you watch this movie at Blockbuster, hide behind Lawnmowerman 2. Everyone who thinks the movie is good should be mentally evaluated.
