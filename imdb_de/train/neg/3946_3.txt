I grew up with Modesty Blaise, both in the comics and the books, and she's really a heroine to me. Although I'm not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I still wanted to know that a few years ago he was considering making a movie about her: Could he finally give Modesty a nice big-screen treatment she deserves? I heard about "My Name Is Modesty" a few months ago and checked the stars given here. I was not too surprised that the score was not too high, as beloved characters often find it hard to melt the fans. Heart, if not done exactly right. So I decided to read no reviews and watch the movie instead. Well, I just finished it and am stunned and sad and yes, pretty angry. Sad and angry that I've seen over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as turning Modesty Blaise's character into a movie that has nothing to offer a viewer or fan. <br /> <br/> It almost seems like everything This film is below average and unprofessional, although I have to admit that in earlier films I have seen some actors in which they were alright, so I can not blame them. But the script and the direction ... my god, why should this crap with production values ​​be a little bigger than an average TV movie, but much worse? I do not know the background of this movie and I really do not want to know, but I can not wonder that Tarantino could say with a clear face that he loves Modesty and then bears his name? He just lost a lot of respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for the job, and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars, and these stars go to the actors and the technical quality they could have gotten worse The other seven missing stars are what this movie was not good at. Well, hopefully there will eventually be a serious production of The Modesty Blaise Movie that has other goals than stealing money from the Modesty fans. Although people like Tarantino make the decisions, I do not hold my breath.
