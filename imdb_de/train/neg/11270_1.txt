I saw bad movies, but that cost the P ***. No sense, and all the characters swear every few seconds, oh, and I think you have a low sperm count. It is so good. A Welshman plays a mischievous Cockney. A classy Englishman plays a disagreeable, unpleasant rascal of a paddy, and a few minor lights play dark pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes, somebody has a gun and may talk about drugs when it's high. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
