I started to watch this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I manage to stay until the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked Jean Hugues Anglade, but I think he had to eat when we were eating and so he agreed to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called "art" or something that I could not express, but I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've seen was a crash, but I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to see it back. <br /> <br /> good luck !! ;O)
