As a longtime Titanic disaster student and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I do not care how many awards and accolades the movie won, but for me it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to shoot a "proper" semi-documentary film about the disaster, but unfortunately chose to make a romantic puddle out of it. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen for it shows, in my opinion, only the sad state and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Who said that all films should have a hero and a hero who falls in love? In fact, most real events are anything but romantic, and the Titanic disaster was certainly not. I think it needed a better script and a better director with a semi-documentary approach and as few artistic licenses as possible. In the last sequence, I almost knocked where the "dead" lovers meet among the other lost passengers and the crew, who burst out amid applause. Is this an intelligent movie? Ask yourself.
