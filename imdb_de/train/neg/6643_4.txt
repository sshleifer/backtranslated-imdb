Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" is too late. We already have enough and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Great directors should not have problems looking beyond their time, not behind them. Why do people only see Romania as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We are born, not born again and nobody knows about old times. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers does not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian movie, not the final song - priveghi! Maybe younger directors should take the step.
