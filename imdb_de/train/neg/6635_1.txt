Four years after his directorial debut with the Arthouse-Snoozer "Welcome To L.A." shows Alan Rudolph what he really wanted from Hollywood was one of the guys. "Roadie" is a frat-boy fracas with barbarians, horny harpies, Art Carney in a souped-up wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a charming appearance on the silver screen, and maybe he's really impressive in a smaller role (in a better movie), but Zalman King's script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless Meat Loaf's wide open and feeble-minded. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie all appear - and all seem embarrassing. You should certainly, "Roadie" is a bad journey. NO STARS of ****
