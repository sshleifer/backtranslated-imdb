We do not have that on TV in England, but I read it on the internet on YouTube. It is dumb, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel. I never got into this cartoon, but I have to admit it better. The cartoonist has not done anything for years. For Doug TenNapel this is a comeback travesty and an all-time low! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and much money from their dead old man. They are in dispute and still object to what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is terrible. The main characters should be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Only strange little animals that see monsters, with big mouths, sharp teeth and big eyes! The human and other animal figures are also really ugly! The title song is terrible and irritating! Even the stories are lame and will most likely be copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. TV is not really what used to be! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me. I'm sorry, but this is a total waste of money and a complete waste of your time. They are glad that Great Britain did not tolerate this crap too much (oh yeah, if you have digital you have to) but not me, so that's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very happy to get that because I gave other shows the worst!).
