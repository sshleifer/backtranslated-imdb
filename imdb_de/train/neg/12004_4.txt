At three hours and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that governs us with six interwoven stories of romantic love (which in my opinion are at least four too many stories). <br /> Filmed like a mix of an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial, the film is a sprawling mish-mash of exotic environments, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, blinking characters crazy dialogues and weird performances that are far from standard when it comes to Bollywood happenings. It's a tedious task just to try to keep all the characters straight while they dance, dance and sting through the incomprehensible story. <br /> <br /> There's a lot for the onlooker to catch his eye here - not least all the stunning women - but he needs the patience of Job to get through it all the way.
