I do not know what's going on with those Brady kids. First, Barry Williams publicly boasts with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, and then with his TV mother, Florence Hederson. Then Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a series of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving. After all, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a little same-sex behavior. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is being chased by a beautiful young model in his early 20s on "The Surreal Life", which was initially fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship. The last episode, when she posed for a couple of nudes with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher's birthday, was not a good step for her. And he was very busy getting up and clearing his head. I think he has always bent for her and now he has finally taken a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think she verbally abuses him. The way she tortured him for an engagement ring and the way she clears it up for anything. She speaks openly that she is hurled with other women, and it is obvious that she still sleeps with women and men on him, which no self-respecting person should do if he is already married to someone. If this were a man who talks to his wife like that and goes out every evening and has sex with other people, everyone would gather behind the woman to leave him. Why should that be different? What started as a sweet little infatuation with another reality show became a major catastrophe. Adrianne, beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who clearly needs therapy because she's crying over as many stupid things as a baby. I'm sorry for her, but Chris has to get rid of her because he's a good man who can not afford to be so humiliated.
