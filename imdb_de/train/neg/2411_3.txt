Hood of the Living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. One night Rick's brother is shot dead by a gang who drove down the street and had fought with him before. Desperately, Rick calls his partner to introduce the latest formula for getting sick blood cells healthy. The formula was not tested on a human or even a corpse, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is just driven away so he can come back to life and feed on human flesh. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother before the whole hood turns into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living dead is a piece of garbage. The plot is a direct rip-off from Resident Evil, acting is terrible, especially when Rick's fake calls for his brother, the guns are so wrong, because every time the gun is fired, it emits sparks and makes the Lame is easy. It's just pseudo blood on the actor's face. The zombies are also modified. They run, growl and have to be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should just be shouting, moaning and have to be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so awful, the outtakes are the only true moment of this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low-budget Cringe festival.
