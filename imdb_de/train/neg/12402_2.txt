I always thought people were a bit too cynical about those old Andy Hardy movies. A few of them were not bad. Modern movie critics are not the ones who are cute rather than evil, so Goody Two movies like these are rarely praised. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can not defend this movie. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over the story. Shaking, just shake your head and ask, "How stupid can you become?" This is crazier than crazy, if you know what I mean. It's so hackneyed that I can not fathom too many people who actually sit the whole hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney), trying to break free from the jam, tells a story about a New York City debut as if this were the ultimate. People used to be much more social. They would hear the term "social climber" as if it would be best to know rich or beautiful people. This is of course all nonsense and looks even more like this today. <br /> <br /> However, this is an innocent and clean story and series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies) that you could find. If you want to hear Judy Garland singing, this is your ticket as she sings some songs here and rubs Andy's heart. Oh man, I almost even write about it!
