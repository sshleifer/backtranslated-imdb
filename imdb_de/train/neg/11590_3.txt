It's getting worse, the series is in a serious case. The first two episodes were acceptable and from then on we saw a lot of really horrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy, but the rest of the cast can not occur. The story is, Alice, who has survived the final episode of the Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger all over again. This time, the mocking murderer beats through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "reborn" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? Look at the first three, miss the next three and look at the last three.
