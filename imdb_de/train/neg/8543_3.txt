I admit that after about 30 minutes I had to fast forward through this badly transmitted DVD. NOTHING happened, and everyone has already described the "conspiracy". But has anyone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher knife is stung by a wig and impaled on the lawn in the front yard! I guess the brave kid did that, it was never explained. Really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I wish it had been a better written or thought out film, because what we have left, if a fool and a movie that does not make sense, is not a "smart" movie, it's just one poorly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a tidy version, and if there is a lack of material I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a strange little movie that can best go through a fast-forward!
