<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "spoof" of bad monster movies, which is worse than the movies it fakes. The (very lean) story tells of tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. They basically turn and growl (yes, they growl) and next you know the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are no-names who never made films after that. So it would be pointless to call them. There is a man who is hired by the government to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black man, who is a master of disguise, and a girl and a man who dives. Anyway, there is another woman who spies on the first man to work for the government. If that does not make much sense to you, you understand. This movie would never have been very good, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at silly assault scenes. The movie is terribly rude, which, although it's the point, really hurts what a (reasonably) entertaining movie could have been. At one point, a giant wax tomato glides on an uncovered wooden plank with wheels on it! Maybe I would have recommended the film if it had a good value for the camp, but even that lacks that awful movie. 2.10
