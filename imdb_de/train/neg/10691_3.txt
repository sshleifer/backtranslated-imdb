I argued with myself about whether or not to rent it. I'm always scared to rent something I've never heard of. Great cast ... that's what the scales have tilted. After 30 minutes, I almost stopped looking at him. The first few minutes are fun, but unbelievable. After that it only gets worse. The authors of this film could research a bit about future projects if they want to make their films even better. Or they could just try to write something credible. I give him a 3 .... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and a 2 for the ability to get so many good actors to make this movie, even though they've read the script. Oh my god, this movie is shit.
