Absolute garbage. The reason this is so terrible is not because it is different from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The supposed star has done nothing to solve the case - and no one else - it was just routine police work. Extremely boring. <br /> <br /> They sat to the end, hoping for a turn - and just got a sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential to have a relative in apparent kidnapping. Could the Lt's personal involvement finally cloud his verdict? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were that a stranger did it. But a genius like Lt. C, through constant conversation with the unfortunate man, would gradually reveal a diabolical plan in which a tape recorder plays in the shower room, while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then gives subtle hints. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
