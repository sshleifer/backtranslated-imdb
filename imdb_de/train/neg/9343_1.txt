How do I begin to review a movie that is soon recognized by the worst director of all time as the "worst movie ever"? A movie that could develop a cult following because it's so bad, is it good? <br /> <br /> An analytical approach that criticizes the film seems both pointless and part of the bandwagon syndrome - let us beat up indifferent, without concern because every other human on earth does it, and people who like the movie, for the mistakes we make. <br /> <br /> The general bad quality of the movie is self-evident - "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" is not without competition for the title of worst movie, so it has to sink pretty low to earn the title and record it, but I think this movie could go away, IMDb does not allow enough words to cite all movie mistakes, and it's a lot easier to find the elements that make 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' right, but unfortunately these are moments of glory buried so far in the shadow of the poverty of this movie that this is a task that is not worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I'm getting into, me had been warned to drink a few cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this (wish this suggestion would have been a cup of vodka) .In spite of my low expectations, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" could not even put me on the level Make fun of the bad movie ". Not only bad, but on a vile basis, as if Jobson deliberately tried to make this movie a poetic yawn, but he was too exaggerated and pushed the poetry in our throat, making it not profound, but witty. ..and allegedly Jobson seriously tried to make a good movie? Even after watching the Sixteen Year Alcohol promotional literature, I find it hard to believe Jobson's sincerity. Senseless and disgusting to the end with several grinning / giggling moments (everything is certainly not intended), the film has spiced, and these few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. So bad is it good? No, it was just enough "I can not believe these are serious movie moments" to keep me from turning it off and nothing else. <br /> <br /> movie connoisseur. Get your own ongoing comment. That would have greatly improved the experience for me. It's so bad that Mike Myers in his cod Scottish accent comments on how he runs to turn that whole piece of mud into a weird farce: "Ok, man, give me Annuder Gliss of Dat Wiskey."
