Let me first say that I love western and civil war stories. I think John Ford is also an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne & William Holden's acting. <br /> <br /> I can not remember if I saw this movie when it was first published in 1959. Last night I saw him for the first time since then. <br /> <br /> Regarding my 4-rating, I can say that I did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> I will now try to show some of his shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script from Harold Sinclair's novel, was a gifted writer and wrote many fine screenplays. This script is poorly written and badly researched. They mention the terrible conditions of Andersonville Prison. At the time of the film Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. John Ford has been a director of films for over 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during manufacture. His usual style was missing. It could be that this was a movie in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a stock company that he used in almost all of his films, most of which were missing this time. This time, only the smaller cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles and of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other known faces except the 3 stars. (See below) Fords has made most of their films classics that they were. unfortunately misses here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke must have been ill too, he seemed out of place here. This type of role was usually perfect for his style, just right here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere better than he normally was. <br /> <br /> It was required that there be an actress in this kind of movie. Here in her first lead (second movie) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person. But not really an actress. She still has roles on TV. Let me be friendly and say that she had a long career based on her looks rather than the acting talent. Also in caas as Ms. Towers servant is tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad that she held on to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films, and a few military songs allegedly made by the marching cavalry are not good at all. The action scenes were good, but came at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Classifications * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
