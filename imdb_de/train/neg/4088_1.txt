This was a turning point in my movie where I saw life. I saw that in the theater when it came out. I was totally surprised how bad it was. Movies like these make you wonder who brought the money and who owed a favor to someone - a very, very big favor. The special effects are absolutely first class, as any first grader could have done. Toy Rubber bats on strings without attempting to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and have the shape of an arrow you would find on a street sign, and a ridiculous plot. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every film student should see that, just to know the definition of a bad movie.
