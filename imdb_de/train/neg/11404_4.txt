I find it fascinating that so many reviewers see this as a masterpiece. I'm not an idiot when it comes to quality movies, and I agree that the film is an award-winning class both from a technical point of view and for some of the characters portrayed. But there is no point (to me) that this movie actually goes anywhere. I mean, take the viewer everywhere. It's a series of mood scenes, perhaps notable as such, but I want more of a movie. I'm looking for history and movement and a fulfillment of the arrival that I did not find in this movie. Yes, it could be poetry in the movie. , , But there are many poems that I can not live with for the same reason: that pictures are painted without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One more thing is that she documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally appalled by what a young British boy had to go through at that time and in that place. I grew up in America just a decade ago and I can say emphatically that the contrast is immense. I can not wonder if this contrast has so positively influenced the film audience. In other words, could there be a tendency to completely judge the film for its "cinematic magic" (which I acknowledge is present) and to ignore completely the lack of relevance to the nature of the actually remembered experience?
