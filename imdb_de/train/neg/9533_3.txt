A textual prologue warns us against allowing evil to invade our home, but I think the more appropriate word is "entropy." I'm sorry, what are these girls' sluts! George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his office in San Francisco and his enormously expensive house in Tiburon, while his wife and child are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on his door and ask for directions. Well, it's raining and they're shaking like two mean, pathetic kitties, and they're not sure what kind of address they're looking for, and for one thing or another, George invites them to come in and take a pizza by the fire. All three end up in Georges bathtub, followed by about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quad exposure and dodecakuple exposure. They spend the night for three and the next morning the girls prepare breakfast for him. But something has changed a bit because Georgie's guests gobble up everything and pour ketchup and syrup all over their laundry and - "They eat like ANIMALS!", George calls and asks them to come out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp leaps like a superball. You have to say they breed here in Shelbyville, Tennessee, they're very cute, and they also breed them with big bumps, as we can tell after the first five or ten minutes /> <br /> But if the girls go mad, they do also the movie. The film is then dipped in a garish green light. The couple adorn themselves with spooky make-up and make themselves in the mirrors Gargoyle faces. They think of a delivery boy and drown him to make sure. They open a storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes where two people sit opposite each other, licking food and making each other's bones jump. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? You first make Georgie unconscious with a mace (which contains nothing you can not find in this little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), tie it up, pour over flour and milk and subject him to a psychotic process, set him down One of these Tolstoy-style executions beat him around, dressed in fancy costumes, denounced him and his practically destroyed upper middle-class house, and was dropped off by a van ex machina. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it's as if someone had said to Georgie: "First, politely to this girl, then panic after being tied up." And to the girls: "At first shy, not willing to impose anybody, then be crazy." And that's it. <br /> <br /> The photography and the site work come directly from a 1970s porn movie. I am not sure that this suggests a lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to make San Francisco ugly. The score gives us two leitmotifs. Georgie's is a pop song with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in". Jackson and Donna is a catchy Rinky thing called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> However, I agree with the moral lesson behind the story. There are some things you just should not give in, even if they are fun at first glance. Everything very educational.
