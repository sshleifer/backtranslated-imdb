*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see that this is a movie that looks good as a screenplay, but it's tortuous, unlikely, and ultimately stupid. I saw the fake death end come a mile away. Rene Z. tries hard with a signed part, as does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can not remember (who is not Chris Penn) is a sweaty actor. If you're not smart enough to tell if a movie is so clever that you can not follow it, and so confusing that you can not understand it. See it if you like kitschy camera work that makes you seasick. Look at it, if you like working with Tim Roth with an unwieldy script. See it when it comes free late at night. Otherwise, hire the usual suspects.
