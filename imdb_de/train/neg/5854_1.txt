I just watched this movie on Flix after recording it with the timing. I grew up with F Troop and had a great deal of hardship for Wrangler Jane. That's why I was shocked, literally shocked. When I saw this movie, Melody Patterson was badly photographing the degenerate death-nurse I never thought she was there in a million years. What is she doing in such a picture? I agree with the guys here that the movie is missing what it is driving. No sex, no blood, no trick. It is also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (circa 1964). Most of the action is boring; The protagonist spends a lot of time running around the doctor's crazy house and cellar and the neighborhood in general, or being wiped out by the cops, all boring and time-consuming. If the Italians had done that, half of the film would have been the Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam stooges who caressed the unconscious nude girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds.
