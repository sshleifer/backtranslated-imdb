This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a musical ever made. The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This film misses the target in almost every way. Even the casting is confusing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is the song of Val. Vals story is that she is a great dancer, but a 3 in the look department. Yes, she does find a solution, but in the end she's a great dancer. What are the brilliant filmmakers doing? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous for looking great. Way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned in the grave. Why did not you use your choreography? It really can not be improved.
