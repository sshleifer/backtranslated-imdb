I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an enthusiastic science fiction fan. I've read countless sci-fi novels and enjoyed a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really would not consider this true science fiction. Every episode I ate was like a lame, watered-down version of a Star Trek episode, apart from anything that might make it interesting or exciting. talk about something boring that occasionally goes through the Stargate and lands on a planet that looks like Earth, with people that look and sound like humans! It seemed like an extremely low budget. The characters are all forgotten one-dimensional excerpts, and the many attempts at humor fall to the ground. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny, but it is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was awful too. With a portal through space you can do so much, and yet every place the ARMY people go is boring! That shows no imagination! I actually thought that the TV series "Alien Nation" a few years ago (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. This show actually had good storylines and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation" but compared to this overrated crap it was great! <br /> <br /> Unlike the big new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too tight! You should have at least updated the cheesy "toilet flush" special effect when someone walks through the Stargate.
