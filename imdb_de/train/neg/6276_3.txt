THE BROKEN is part of the After Dark Horrorfest III. No slasher or filled with blood. This broken French thriller and author and director Sean Ellis contain tons of broken glass and mirrors. Successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) is crossing a strange world as her life seems to be out of control. At the birthday party of her father (Richard Jenkins), guests are stunned when a mirror falls to the ground for no apparent reason. Things get really strange when she testifies to a woman who is the picture of herself driving on a London street in a car identical to her car. Gina sneaks into her doppelganger's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father. She drives away and gets involved in a head-on-head collision. Then her friend is mysteriously not the same; In fact, her family and friends are not easy to trust. Is Gina crazy? Is she in a parallel world? Your nightmares are getting more terrible ... is she broken? The editing could not be narrower. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
