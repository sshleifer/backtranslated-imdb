This movie was just awful, the first movie was not that great, I mean, it's ridiculously stupid, if he did not have enough in the first five movies to add another, why not put it in a sequential series like James Bond I tell you exactly why, because the Bond movies are really very good and these movies just stink, I do not understand that this is supposed to be a cross between genres like horror and comedy Niece would not be afraid of such a ridiculous horror attempt, a spit in the face of people who want to be scared, at least in a so-called horror movie. Please no more of these films.
