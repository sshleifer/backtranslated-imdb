Cedric Kahn's films were based on characters rather than action (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges). It's terrible to see this series of really skilled chases interspersed with a few boisterous attempts to give Succo a character. I think that Stefano Cassetti is not an interesting actor. He reminds me of professional athletes who, like Bret Favre, get involved in movies. This blank look looks like a really wicked deer in the spotlight. A real actor would have forced us to reflect on Succo's personality rather than admire his carjacking abilities. <br /> <br /> The little acting comes mainly from Isild le Besco, because the needy schoolgirl who takes Succo by storm. The interview in the police office is a miracle of sober obstinacy with a little anxiety about the future. Le Besco, apart from this film, there is little to recommend.
