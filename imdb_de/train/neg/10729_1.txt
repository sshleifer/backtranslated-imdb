Let me first say that I consider myself one of the (most!) Most open-minded theatrical observers ... Movies are my passion and I am a big regular in my local cult film distribution. I also feel the need to add that they always ask me for advice whenever I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the place without having had a detailed discussion or exchange of thoughts about it Movie section ... I like to lend strange things, and that's why this movie was recommended by one of the guys in the cult movie video location. He told me he thought I needed to see this and since the cover says something about being a Jodorowsky-inspired movie (one of my favorites!) I rented it. <br /> <br /> The voice cast here is not really fair because I'm not right I think it's awful, I just did not know how to rate it differently. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made me sick: I actually felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally turned? Still, I did not want to turn it off, or maybe I just could not because I was so intrigued ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, a 1 as I said. Just not my cup of tea (or vodka for that matter) ...
