When theater employees find an old movie role, they decide to show it at Night of the Living Dead's midnight performance, assuming it's an old fast-forward. Unfortunately, it's an old Nazi mind-control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless zombies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the hatred of this movie. It's a low-budget independent production with a lot of stock, but it does not deserve "1.1" here on IMDb. It's just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have the proper knowledge and love for old horror films, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them, sprinkled with references and tributes to a multitude of them. It has the feel of things like Night of the Living Dead (very similar in many ways), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and several others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how the zombies do it Although it's just hypnotized that they're zombies, they actually have the physical qualities of the living dead - unbelievable - but I appreciate the authors' efforts to explain it. The Gore effects were decent for the budget, the drama was fine and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
