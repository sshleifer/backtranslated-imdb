So they were hoping for the violence and it was called sick. Well, the violence is the best, I'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to understand why they are conducting their (totally predictable) raid. This movie has a really horrible script. We never have the opportunity to meet Robert, and his actions in the end are just pathetic. Acting is not much better, the worst is the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is awkward, the pace is enough to send you to sleep. And what is the school film project anyway? A comment on the movie maybe? The use of newsreels during the murder is ridiculous. These people obviously think that they are intellectuals, but are hopelessly overwhelmed. How on earth have they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light them, I'll never know. And how they got the money to earn it is an even bigger secret. Absolutely terrible, incomprehensible.
