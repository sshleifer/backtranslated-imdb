End of the World is an uneventful film that is strange because it is about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I'm not sure what kind it is. He has two jobs in a government facility guarded by four security forces (?). His first job is monitoring transmissions into and out of space (though that's actually more of a hobby he does when he's not working on Job 2). Job # 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least that's the best I can think of. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly secret, because the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs around (on her way to dinner) while discovering a message from outer space: Major Earth Disruption, over and over again. He says something about it being the first space message he could ever decode; His wife tells him they will be late for dinner. So they go and go to the party (!?!). Moments later, he learns that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is there, but that does not help much. Lee also gives a lackluster performance in the style of his Howling II performance. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might have to suffer if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade Sci-Fi. There are also a lot of shots of the destruction of the earth.
