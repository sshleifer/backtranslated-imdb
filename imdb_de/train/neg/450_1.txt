This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It's obvious the creators had no idea what to do with this show, about the ever-changing "jobs", friends and cast. It seems like they wanted to occupy Amanda Bynes ... but they had no idea what, and they had that shitty show. They gave them as teenagers, surrounded by twenty and thirty years, and brought them in mostly adult situations in repeatedly failed comedy attempts. Soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and people from her late 20s go through as a teenager. <br /> <br /> How this series survived 4 seasons is inexplicable to me. Somehow, ABC decided it was a "family show" and included it in the afternoon cast of ABC Family.
