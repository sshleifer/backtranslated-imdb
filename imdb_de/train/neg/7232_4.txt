I really enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and I was amazed to see the trailer for this movie. Even more so, when I realized that Bilal had directed him himself. The movie was a big failure though. The visuals are far from the rich and grainy texture of the original artworks, and the story is poorly narrated. Bilal seems to have focused on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do a particularly good job. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the hate friendship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both not in the right time and place, crowded together by the circumstances. Above all, they were funny and sympathetic. Not so here. Nikopol has no identifiable personality, and Horus is a pompous guy who just wants to lay down. Even if the movie is a French movie, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We saw all the movies we liked, but we would not recommend them to anyone for some reason. I would not recommend anyone to Immortel, except perhaps as a warning not to exceed your talent and resources. Bilal is a master of the storyteller but obviously not a master of any visual medium.
