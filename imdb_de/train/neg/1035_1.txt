Terrible spectacle, terrible cast and cheap props. Would have been much better if set as an action parody-style movie. What a waste. Based on the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" The term "Action Movie" would have done better. (Contribution to the parody effect). The policeman looked like a 60-year-old player, the blonde girl always had the same, boring expression on her face. Towards the end of the film, he and she work together to slay the bad guys, and every time they swap, it feels like they're giving the cheap lines to a sex scene in a porno movie. Dreadful. Do not waste your time.
