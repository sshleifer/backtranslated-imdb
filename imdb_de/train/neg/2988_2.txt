First of all, I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This movie was totally rubbish. I could not bear to see it. The plot was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke people BACK TO LIFE. Anyway, this movie is not worth the $ 1 it costs to rent. I really enjoyed Lucio Fulci movies, but this was awful. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of what Zombi 4 and 5 will look like, I think I'll just skip it. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a fantastic thing.
