I have not seen this movie for ages, but I thought I would still comment on it, mainly because the memory of not liking it is burned into my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was initially not a prize, but at least the difference was that it was 1: a Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) a virtue of Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) a relatively painless way to blow away for an hour and half a time. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the 1994 version for the then-fervent Alec Baldwin and his soon-to-be divorced wife Kim Basinger is little more than a vanity piece. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also parted shortly after their version of the film was filmed, and one can imagine the Baldwins at their marriage council arguing over who the stupid idea is to make this film. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it and stay out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been around the Cooler King, and never will, and one of the reasons this remake annoys me so much, is the arrogance that Baldwin suspects challenge our memory of Steve McQueen. As someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 movie premiere was a satirical play that was supposed to somehow parody the Action / Adventure Heist genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger & Company seem to produce a more serious tone, with only the slimy, indecent villain characters of Michael Madsen and James Woods becoming real humans. <br /> <br /> The film is also decidedly temperamental and unlikely on a fundamental level that is hard to put into words. A contemplation was more than enough, not only because she had nothing new to offer, but because she was so artless. Peckinpah's film was actually a stylish little conversation that had a positive mood, and this version is a slog that takes too long to mean little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for its existence and some of the nastier scenes are so uncomfortable that they find it difficult to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I do not know, that was probably one of the films that helped initiate The Wave of Pointless, Artistically Weak Big Budget Remakes Carried Around A Former Actor / Actress which in itself is not a really good thing. I'd always rather see a filmmaker trying to come up with a new idea for a film and fall for something original. This movie just made me raise my eyebrows, and it makes it clear that over the next 15 years since his release, Mr. Baldwin has become known as one of Hollywood's biggest jerks. I thank God for "Team America" ​​for putting him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
