While blondes and brunettes attract the most attention (I'll always appreciate Yutte Stensgaard), the pretty red-brown actress with the deep voice radiated both intelligence and vulnerability (an example of this is the 1960's "Village of the Damned") Screening time was much shorter than her character's husband, George Sanders, she's the only reason to see this shabby update to "Cat People" and it's consistently seen as a big advantage (it's hard to tell if her beauty is one) Tie was.) Better showcase). Her character seems to be sleeping naked, and we are exposed to her voluptuous, bare back when she awakens (even 8 years later "Rasputin-The Mad Monk", 8 years later). The gorgeous dress she wears most of the time The movie is a dazzling, strapless wonder (I can not tell what the dress held up, but I'd like to do it). All in all, a positive proof that Barbara Shelley in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses rises above her material and makes the film consistently observable, a true test of the star power that she had in the 1960s in Hammer- Studios in Bray would find soon enough.
