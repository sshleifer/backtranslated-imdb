*** Contains Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it amazingly boring and rather superficial, regardless of importance and depth. The Proposed Themes: Considering that in the end we have to die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find ways of not meeting Sabina? How important is loyalty in a relationship? How much of working life can be mutilated for our loved ones? How much must we be involved in the political life and social problems of our country? Unfortunately, I have not read Kandera's novel, but after being disappointed with the film, I will certainly do so: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie being filmed (which is my guess is) or if she was boring from the beginning. I agree with most of the positive comments that have defined the film as a movie masterpiece. I just do not see the reasons. What I see are many shortcomings, and a selection of them follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them in their decisions. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are just there to fill in the blanks, but they add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I did not do that as Tomas was imitated. Nothing is good for him. He is so selfish and selfish. He is not human in a sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he is dependent on others and emotionally connected to someone, I did not find the interpretation believable. <br /> <br /> 4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina can afford this lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. Besides, the three main characters in their respective occupations are all very successful, which I find strange appears. a) How can Tereza easily become such a good photographer? b) How can you do so well in a country that does not lack economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The wrong accents of the English spoken by the actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even native. In addition, the letter that Sabina receives in the US is written in Czech, which I find very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film and said that Prague was beautifully done: I think most of it was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the film an Eastern European feel and, given the inherent beauty of Prague, it is not even difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end somehow trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the country, far from the temptations of the "metropolis", far from the social struggles that live their fellow citizens, detached from their professional life and in a car accident killed. But they die after realizing that they are indeed happy. So what? If they had died unhappily, would the message of the film have been different? I do not think I thought it was a cheap trick to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing that is unbearably light in this movie is the way the director portrayed the characters. You can see them for almost three hours, but in the end there is nothing left. You do not feel compassion, you have no relation to them, you are left there on your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated the "Stop the music in the restaurant" scene (which some praised a lot). Why does Sabina have such a strong reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? I really do not understand the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina is in a very bad mood and has a pretty strong personality. That's it. What is so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked very much (that's why I gave him two). <br /> <br /> The "Naked Women Photoshoot", beautifully depicting the envy, jealousy and uncertainties of Sabina and Tereza. <br /> <br /> The other scene represents the investigation into the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza images informing the world about what is going on in Prague identify those involved in the riots. I found it rather original and Tereza's sense of desperation and guilt are well presented. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is little possibility that the film was deliberately "designed" so that "Tomas types" are going in the right direction to like it and "Terezas" will hate it. If this is the case (but I strongly doubt it) my comment should be drastically revised.
