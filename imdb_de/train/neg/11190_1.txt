First of all, I have to say that I worked for blockbusters and saw some films to the point that it's hard to find something I did not see. With that in mind, I want everyone to know that this movie is by far the worst movie ever made. He made me a Gigli, the daughter of my boss and every other garbage you've ever seen. BeLyt must be crazy, I just found a person who liked it, and even they could not tell me what the movie was about. If you can decode that movie and tell me what it was about, you must either be the writer or a fortune teller, because there's another way a person can find that crap. <br /> <br /> FOR THE LOVE OF GD WAY!
