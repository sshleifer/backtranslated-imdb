This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television retired from my life in 1981, so I never watched the show or part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charm of moonlighting for most reviewers seems to have. <br /> <br /> (Possible Spoiler Warning) <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting pilot is your basic "Caveman meets Fluffball" yarn, with a "charming" red-blooded He-Man manipulating a misguided woman realize what she really wants and needs. The premises on which the "wit" of the script is based, must have looked already as early as 1950 as stale. It also, frankly, contains bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the establishment instead of shooting the bad guy to prove himself unable to work. Ms. needs male help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts when she sees a male chauvinist conspiracy in simple conversation, but in this particular case, I'm with her - Moonlighting has stamped BACKLASH above everything. <br /> <br /> In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it includes the screen test that Willis used to land the job. Both features show to what extent Willis developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (The Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> rating (and I'm a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
