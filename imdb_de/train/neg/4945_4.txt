Sure, this is neither a blockbuster, nor does he aim at such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician who is either loved or hated for his way of acting and that is what this film is all about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen", which was written a few years ago, but is not intended. The movie is filled with sexually offensive content (at least for American standards) that is either amusing (of course not for the other "actors") or stupid - it depends on your individual humor or whether you're a "plank" - Fan or not. Technically, there is not much to criticize. Speaking of which I think this movie is an OK movie.
