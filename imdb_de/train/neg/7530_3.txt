I found this movie boring, monotonous and rather uninteresting with a hurried, flat "upbeat" ending that did not do justice to the overall story. If I followed these characters through a weekend of terrible events, unfriendly attitudes, and bad news, that's not my idea of ​​a worth seeing, interesting movie, and I got tired of the "One Note" theme and could not wait for the movie to end goes. In fact, I almost stopped halfway. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and uncomfortable, though the acting was good. A small movie with little ambitions and a little attraction - I'm sorry, but it just did not make it, and I love good little movies! This just did not jump, although I always watched it hoping that I hope so. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on the list of the "Top 10" of the year. I would strongly recommend to watch "The House of Sand" instead - now there is a good little movie!
