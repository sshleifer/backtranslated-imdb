I grew up with Scooby (somehow the repetitions of where you are). I hate Scrappy, dear Daphne, and feel that it is not complete. But that's sad, Scooby Doo is a mystery that solves comedies - not bad, everything is a spy anime. I like "What's new", they had to give the dangerous Daphne sometime a makeover :( and try to lose the * sexual * drug jokes of many generations, but this "clue" is just crap and should not be The Scooby name They've even tried to make the lame song a lame punk thing and now I'm going to watch my DVD from Scooby doo, where you can wash the dirt of this new series off my eyes
