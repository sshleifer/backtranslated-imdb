(I'll give the point where spoilers begin in this review.) My dissatisfaction is split: 30% tone deafness, 70% weak writing. <br /> <br /> The 30%: I agree with the summary of the first commentator on the lack of diversity in terms of the characters and the scope of the stories. I was amazed how this film, in the best case, shakily changes real NYC by presenting a collection of people and relationships that are as close as if they were inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (this comes from someone who likes Gossip girl). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but they are compulsory, while we can see the passages under the film so clearly and want to be "varied," but always stay so short. <br /> <br /> The 70% is the reason why everything goes down. All characters, white and a few minorities, are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts of person concepts. Worse, their interactions with each other are written in such a way that every vignette in the film deals with what I call a "gag": we get a basic idea, then a punchline that's supposed to be clever Twist. But even if we put the cynicism down for a moment and say, "Okay, that was a surprise" ... the stories are still not so interesting because they too are flat. If you make stories in such a way that their existence depends only on the unexpected of the end, write jokes. <br /> <br /> spoiler downstairs ... <br /> <br /> The film tries primarily to tell romantic stories. It's good. But romance is amazing, deep and sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories are each about a girl and a boy, who eventually find themselves in the same place and can look at each other. Words exchange ideas, thoughts are projected via voice-over, but they also manage to only tell the audience that one person is being attracted to another. <br /> <br /> That is, there is no seduction (in the broadest sense). No tension and no confrontation or communion between the will of two different people, trying to reconcile their existence with the other. The only story that involves a superficial "seduction" is only told so that the audience is surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawke) is outwitted by the girl he meets and unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker. Sure, his words when trying to pick them up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we would be if we were next to them, but outside of "A then B," this story has no content. So it unfolds when something like a postcard could "unfold" along with all the other stories: A and B - That's it, the only point is that these events happen "on set" in Manhattan. Incidentally, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch. The only queen is the flickering of a train ride that takes a person traveling to the West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to watch movies that play all common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation and sexuality soon. New York, I Love You, however, deserves a tighter test due to its title. We expect to see real New York and the real New Yorkers, but instead we have shown the selected piece to a demographic group whose characters were flown in by the OC, and a few others to make it into SEEM, as if we were careful would become diversity. But if we take a closer look at who those characters are, the whole scam becomes an affront to the diversity and ethnicities and cultures that the film shamelessly portrays. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of the Latino man with the little white girl in the park who is confused by two ladies as Manny, even though he is actually the father. Although the last scene of this part was dramatically unnecessary (it would have been far more interesting to end it if the mother and boyfriend / stepfather were killing the girl), it is, frankly, a disgusting scene in which we are sure to learn the father of the girl is Latino ALSO must tell us that he is a sexually-desirous dancer. What, father can not just be a guy from South America? Now that he's obviously hot, is the public more willing to accept that he had a child with a white middle-class woman? Are we so na√Øve that we need that? As if a Mexican construction worker was obviously too inedible. <br /> <br /> It's not my job to determine where the movie should have gone. But in every imaginable attitude and plot twist, the direction the status quo goes in is screaming. All of these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to maintain the one-dimensionality of the characters living within, at least by not choosing between standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown and being smiled by a quirky old white guy? How about an Asian cougar following a white college kid instead? I'm not saying again that the whole performance has to be changed. It's just everybody. Damn it. Story premise. is so hackneyed - and so they do not convey anything about why you could love New York outside of the trio. The real way to improve the film would be to have written a worth reading screenplay. <br /> <br /> I admit the amenity of the soundtrack, the good tempo of the movie (even if the tempo was, well, dredge) and the general feeling of many scenes. The movie was alright, and I would not stop anyone. However, it is said that the most significant homage to non-superficiality is that the old opera singer (paraphrased) says, "That's what I love about New York: everyone's from a different place." Well, you would not know if you looked at this one.
