I saw this movie when I was a young guy full of angry hormones, and it was about as sexy as I'd ever seen it - or ever was. It might not be a great movie. My guess is not. I do not really remember that to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever done it for me, as the incredibly sexy Cathy did in this movie. I have not seen it since the first time since I saw it on TV in the '70s and I do not think I want to see it again because I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not so angry and I've become more and more jadiger over the years. When I think back to the shower scene, I can still remember how great it felt then. <br /> <br /> Later added: After watching the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home. What was once erotic is now pretty tame. The older woman, the younger man, still works for me, just not as much as before, probably because I'm not a 12-year-old anymore. This older woman is now younger than me. The amateurish nature of the whole thing was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better not to reconsider the past.
