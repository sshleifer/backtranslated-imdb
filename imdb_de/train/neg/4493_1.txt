I tried to remove everything that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie, or at least know the general core, so if you do not make the slightest statement. <br /> <br /> Content: This movie beats the audience in front of the movie head repeatedly with tired philosophical walks to convey the theme. We are repeatedly bombarded by questions of purpose, fate, and decision, and are forced to endure the long, agonizing sessions in which they are contained. Neo, awakened from a dream of the last movie, Now begins a period of knowledge about his own existence. There are many revelations in this film that I will be unclear about so they do not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you're still worried, vague references will spoil the movie, don 'Read the following paragraph. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of the faith becomes clear. The strengths and weaknesses of love and their transient nature are also revealed. The interdependence of people and technology as well as our trust in technology are also becoming clear. The importance of choice and experience is shown. Explaining more things that are revealed would be too detailed, so I will refrain from doing so (as dictated by the guidelines for writing a comment). By the way, by "obvious" I mean, whirling through our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Storyline: How come Neo and the gang from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next movie? In short, they keep their faith and use and abuse excessively stylized action and bullet-time as if they were out of style (and after this ad, I hope moviegoers and creators alike will appreciate the subtlety and originality a bit more) , More on that later. Not to spoil anything, I say no more than the promotional material has already done: Neo is still trying to figure out the matrix, and he's looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, while bad guys are following him and his Cohorts The film pretty much starts where the last one left off. <br /> <br /> Action: While martial arts action and gunplay got its predecessor mixed in equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay and adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used in the face of the audience and curled that it gets really tiring. I've discussed this movie with friends and colleagues, and almost everyone has found that some of the action sequences - especially the "Smith fight" we all hear in the movie - are too long and boring. This is a big red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either have a little more desire or be completely satisfied with the just marked Awesomeness. <br /> <br /> These fight scenes do not. They are over stylized, exaggerated sequences that are made of wood and not resourceful. In the first movie, there was a sense of desperation in some of the action, a feeling that the fight was for survival and not just good looking (which I honestly do not think they can do in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Check out this movie Drunken Master or Iron Monkey to remember what good fighting sequences are - you will not regret it. Moreover, the "matrix skills" people have in Reloaded are not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first film had its inconsistencies here, but was not too impressive - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are being poured on and on. Every little thing someone does, whether it's just jumping, somersaulting, spinning, and in many cases just posing, is slow, time-limited, or over-emphasized by a kind of destruction. It's obvious that the W Bros had a lot of money to throw this movie, and boy, they threw it, with no real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped, but the first film was such a hit that the free reign was obviously given, which brings us to it. , , <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already said, more or less, that the dialogue is tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can not really lend much depth to their character if the script and direction shape or neglect the face of the character's audience. Nuance and substance are never given to the audience so that they can look at the figure alone. <br /> <br /> Keanu's acting performance is stiff at best. Keanu is good at being confused, and that's all he's doing in this movie. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V and to be as cool as a cat. With the script that is provided to him, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat. <br /> <br /> Moss is also not very credible. Their expression of concern is always the same, similar to Keanu, and the chemistry is not there, though they are faked well enough in their physical scenes. Hugo once again had his strange feeling an agent program, but he too suffered under the hand of the script. I think he's actually the most interesting character of the group, but instead of development, they only make him an excuse for a long, drawn-out fight scene. All in all, this movie is more than disappointing If you had good expectations of yourself as a stand-alone movie (which should not be so), that's still terrible. I do not see The Matrix that deep, but at least I see it as an entertaining sci-hype, with some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusion to amuse the attentive audience. Reloaded fails on all these points and I really hope the W-Bros will provide us with a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I do not have much hope after this movie.
