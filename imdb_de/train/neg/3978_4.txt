When In Rome is a significant improvement on the way. When I got there, I was too predictable, too slow, and I still think it's the worst of the Olsen twins. Although When In Rome is not a horrible movie, it's not great either. If I had to summarize it in one word, I would say passable. It's great fun for teens, but I think adults do not have much to keep going. <br /> <br /> When In Rome has its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are pretty decent actresses, certainly very pretty. I admit when I was about 10 years old, I really liked them and in general I still like them. And I enjoyed some of their films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back at the finish both girls do not do such a bad job, in fact they are very appealing. Plus her outfits are a dream, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not bad either. <br /> <br /> However, where the movie is shut down is in action and in the script. The script is mostly clich√©d and has references to Deja Vu. The storyline, like most films by Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and those familiar with the work of the Olsen twins will find some rather unoriginal elements. Most characters are as thin as cardboard, and you learn little about them, and sometimes the tempo is uneven. Unfortunately, the stunning scenery is spoiled by rather sloppy camera work, which was always hectic. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has its good points and can certainly be seen. For my taste, however, it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
