Do not watch this movie if you value your opinion. At the end of our joint visit, I and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brain during its course. The only person involved in the production and not clinically crazy was the set designer. Most films leave a bad taste in the mouth. I now realize that instead of a feeling of disgust, this film has created a deep hatred in me. I hate this movie so much, very much. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this movie should not be taken seriously. If only it had not taken seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed-up version of the Blade Runner-like universe, blended with the cheap rubber suits that are so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only pueril and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether it's Juliet Landua's British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as a seething commissioner, you'll sink into an ever-growing sense of disbelief and disillusionment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depths of stupidity that humanity can fall for.
