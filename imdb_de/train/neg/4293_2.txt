"The Rainmaker", released in 1956, has some of the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main actors. Not even they can save this completely overplayed melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is a terrible misstep as a shy spinner - despite her brilliance as an actress, she can not even manage that. It's too strong to be credible because it's so simple, and just too old for the role. Lancaster is extreme, and Earl Holliman is far too sardonic and seems more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to be a little over the cast - but even they can only do so much. It seems that the fifties Katharine Hepburn as an actress want to spread their wings something, and that's a good thing. She only made a bad choice here. Luckily for her fans (I was one of them) she did not do too many of them. Despite an A-list and good production values, it does not work.
