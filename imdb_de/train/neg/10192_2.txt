One of the Lamer wedding movies you'll see. It smells too much of its time, so it was outdated before it got to the cinemas. The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke, except that they are just funny here. Molly Ringwald, what else is to be said? Give a clue to the stupidity, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "It just will not be me" makes it in this rag, with straps and a top hat, and everyone smiles at her moxy to ringwallow her neck. It's a hell, a cast, how hard Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
