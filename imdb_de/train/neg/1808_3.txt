In his film "Blow Up" (1966) Antonioni challenged his hero against the background of British youth protesters. Antonioni put such questions against a network of hippie youth movements and deliberately or not questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you believe to be true can actually be a lie? On the other hand, the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we are seeing because others are deceiving us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the stickiest parts of "Blow Up," they created a beautiful texture and gave the movie more meaning than he could have otherwise. It was a very cautious and mature little movie. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes fully mature hippie. The result is a movie that gets swamped with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and diligent narration. How could someone who was so reserved and intelligent throughout his career do something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film opens with a nice series of close-ups as we observe a group of radicals discussing the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. He recognizes that while revolutionaries are committed to freedom, engaging with such a militant cause means effectively giving away your freedom. And like Mark Nicholson in The Passenger, Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a weapon and goes solo. He does not take orders from anyone. When the police raid his university campus, Mark shoots a man and runs away. Then he flees to a nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia, juxtaposing it with the ruthless capitalist cities with their billboards and hollow modern gadgets. He sees the desert as a kind of garden Eden. In the desert, Mark meets Daria and falls in love quickly. Antonioni gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free of the constraints of modern life, these tree huggers and student radicals can celebrate their individualism by leaping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasizing to blow up the mansions and stately homes of the wealthy capitalists who killed him. It is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Take the weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. Tear the walls before they are locked up! <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie had no impact on the audience. They recognized "Zabriskie Point" as another self-centered commercial attempt to be radical. A kind of commercialized radicalism. It did not feel honest and tame. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are dissatisfied with the modern world and the fat cats you exploit, you should either flee to the desert (Mark) or actively fight against the system (Daria). That's all well and good. Although artists constantly warn us about such dystopian nightmares, most of the time, they can not show us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of the Fight Club, nihilism and violence do not achieve anything. In the real world, social change tends to be driven by modest inventors driven by minor technological advances. I mean, what liberated women more than contraception? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is, Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a calm and thoughtful man. An introvert who seems to have made an extrovert movie to bring more admiration to the counterculture that embraced his earlier film, Blow Up. So "Zabrinskie Point" acts as a very presumptuous and stupid movie. It's essentially a 50-year-old man: "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films that ask audiences to "fight the system," but all fall into one of four categories. In the first category there are films like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All show that the life of freedom fighters all failed, although in any case the "spirit of revolution" has survived. The message is that you can not make any difference, but dying or failing makes the optimistic concept of change survive the martyrdom. In essence, we must continue to fail instead of giving up hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have films like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down" that just encourage you to explode. Tear everything. Bubble Everything Everything is a lie, so you can run out of cannon as well. These films are made of angry, reactionary feelings and not of any common sense. Then you have the category "flight instead of fight". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films like "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show people walking in worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful oases. Both directors are pessimists, as Malick has destroyed his islands and Antonioni offers his islands no sense of luck or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films like Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" treat artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, where everyone is content to be a slave to the state, it is the unrestrained creativity and free will of the artist / criminal who keeps the system in check. By simply existing outside the herd, you create waves. Her comments, actions and critical eye challenge the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film has undermined novels and artists who undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick Alex has the artist / criminal, who fights Nazi droogs and paints the city with blood and semen.
