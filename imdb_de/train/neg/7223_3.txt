My first attempt to see this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the TV review scene that I could not handle. It went something like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * awkward silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I saw it to the end, and it was not as horrible as I imagined, but it does exist serious problems with this. About half of the action can easily be discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the back story or something. <br /> <br /> What good are the detective, the eugenics and the monsters being temporarily disposed of by Horus? More amusing was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who have lived for eons, and of all the games in the multiverse, we play monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent in comparison. The other half is terribly missing. What did our protagonist do to feel frozen? Why was not there a big event when he was finally released? He had these annoying followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the deal with the masked guy? How did the blue-haired girl appear? What about her eyesight? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's more or less okay to ignore the Egyptian gods, who look like they're walking around with Rotweiller heads.
