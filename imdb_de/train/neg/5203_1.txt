I've seen bad movies in my time, but that really needs the cookie! Why, why was this movie made? There is simply nothing here. Please trust me, turn off the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is an action ... that can take about 5 minutes to be shown in front of the camera. This is the main problem, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... whatever) does not lend itself for 80 minutes in any way. So we have to sit for over an hour and watch people walking around. That's it! Absolutely nothing happens in the first half-hour, apart from how someone goes to a store ... and then 3 guys walking through a forest. This time might have been spent developing the character, but no. And so there is absolutely no connection to the people on the screen. So when they get shot, we do not care. In fact, I finally agreed to the villain for the movie to end! In addition, the camera work is really terrible! This director / publisher / writer / producer, Ti West, is garbage. I hate beating a guy, but his work is made up of pants! These boring close-ups are done continuously, and then it takes a long time for them to follow people when they walk. I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and slit my wrists! How this man was led to direct the next cabin fever movie, I do not know! Finally, the acting is also sad, ... which applies to the film as a whole. Keep your mind, stay away from this pile of excrement!
