IMPRESSIVE! Why would someone make a sequel to a rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but had at least an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It exists only for reasons that I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is as follows: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is moved to another prison where a box of gold bricks may be buried. In jail riots break out between rival inmates, one of them is shot dead by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans to escape. During a marital visit, Twitch's fiancée and Burkes (played by Bill Goldberg)'s daughter are kidnapped by Cortez and held in an execution room. Burke reluctantly becomes friends with Twitch and they get into trouble with the idiotic inmates, finding out that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is awful, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. I know it was a low budget movie, but that's no excuse for the guys not to care what they do. Nobody in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. Nobody in this "movie" can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of himself. His character "Twitch" is pretty much a spiderless minstrel doll who poses most of the time while being raised by Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time pouting the movie as if he's going to have to do a PHD (quite a huge garbage dump). The fight scenes are badly choreographed and pitiful, and for an action movie, HPD2 is pretty boring, even when action is taking place! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is a decent one, it stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follywood.
