An uninspired and indistinguishable "new" columbo who watches the man on Mac attend his nephew's wedding just so his bride can disappear on her wedding night. Columbo is investigating ... <br /> <br /> And it's about: indifferently plotted and surprisingly loaded with a flat script as it was written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote the most enjoyable Columbo story "Murder Under" Glass There is not even a murder to talk about, and the greatest ingenuity offered by scriptwriter Columbo is the confinement of the suspects from the photos taken at the wedding, including all of them Apart from all sorts of Columbo features, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues, an insult to the story of the series, with a soap opera-style style, very avoidable stuff.
