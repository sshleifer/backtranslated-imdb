Well, should we start? This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever paid. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. Acting, except Eric Bana, is primarily soap opera quality. I have always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here all the actors of The Bold and The Beautiful are ashamed of him. The camera action does not help synonymous. How it stays with him, when he thinks, it just brings me back to Brooke Forresters days in the lab! Peter O'Toole either had a really bad plastic surgery or he desperately needs one. Anyway, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! Diane Kruger is a sweet girl, but she is not Helena of Troy. Peterson would have preferred to choose Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor was now quite suspicious.
