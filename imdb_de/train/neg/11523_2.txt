"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally inappropriate and amateurish attempt at a horror movie with crazy hippie cult murders. Also, almost twenty years later, Charles Manson was still an avid but incompetent trash filmmaker. This is a typical troma production. That is, there is a lot of boring and completely irrelevant upholstery material that accompanies the nonsensical plot. There is a bit of coincidence and unfounded nudity to see? what is not bad? But it's all so pointless and ugly that it gets frustrating to look at it. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that he even uses twice as much material as the circle saw, for example, killing. The incoherent conspiracy tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addict and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower disciples, Igor, gets a little obsessed with the Bible stories and the drug orgies, gradually letting the whole cult sink into criminal madness. To illustrate just how cute Igor is by just a small example: he rips the heart out of a really sexy black hitchhiker girl! There's an annoying synth soundtrack and some really embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks like slow motion shots and wild dream sequences. Maybe there is a sequence that qualifies more or less as worthwhile for garbage fanatics, and when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the blade in its bloody stomach for fifteen seconds.
