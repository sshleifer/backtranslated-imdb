Jude Law gives everything in this beautifully filmed vampire strip, which otherwise offers little value. There is a complete lack of eroticism, excitement or leading ladies with attraction. A decent fight, a few moments of mild tension. And a plot with a note. <br /> <br /> The film becomes philosophical in a series of conversations between Law's character and a dogged murder commissioner well played by Timothy Spall. Despite their best efforts, both actors stand at the crossroads of the banality of the film. <br /> <br /> With a minor actor in the lead role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis' cinematography - Crocodiles would mix the sea of ​​low-budget vampire quickies.
