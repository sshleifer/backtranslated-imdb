The one-sheet and newspaper campaign (as so often) suggested a much sharper and more violent piece than was shown on the car cameras. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has worked in films for years. That's pretty hard to find; I would like to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but do not remember particularly impressed times. Chances are that it was a hacked version that made it into the US cinemas and videos. But oh, this one leaf ... still a jewel of my later horror collection.
