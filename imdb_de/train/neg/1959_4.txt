The Tooth Fairy is about the spirit of an old, deformed witch who lures children into their house to get a price for their loose tooth, and then their lives cost. The first few minutes introduce you to the beginning of the Legend of the Tooth Fairy of 1949 and change to the present. The worn-out horror plot is pretty well saved by solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the Gore scenes were bloody but fast, which had a minimizing effect. The eye candy is pretty good for both sexes. Camera work is good. The dialogue is fair, but cheesy. I expected the movie to be a naked bone, a cheap slasher with very few salvation factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
