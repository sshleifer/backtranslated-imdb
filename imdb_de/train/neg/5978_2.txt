This third pokemon movie is too abstract to watch younger kids, and it repeats itself too much to entertain older kids. The message of the film - about the handling of loss - is undermined by the return of the father of the young girl during the credits of the film. Team Rocket is a bit entertaining, but they are not really part of the little plot, so they do not appear very often.
