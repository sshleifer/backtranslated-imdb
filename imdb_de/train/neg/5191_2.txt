Ahh, the boring t.v. Shows and pilots who were beaten up in the 70s to be equally boring. Movies! Some examples include Riding With Death (the hysterically cheesiest of the party), Stranded in Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (dreadfully boring and incredibly confusing) and this refined piece of Quinn Martin glamor. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (though you would not know it from outside), it seems like a failed pilot of a lame spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the drab main character, Diamond Head, who seemed to be half asleep for the entire movie. his boss 'Aunt Mary', who had a very strange delivery of his lines and white hair, as well as the tan that looked like she had stucco on it; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / agent (Hell, I can not even remember her name), a skinny, wooden woman with flat speech that is not sexy or interesting; and the singing buddy Zulu (again I can not remember the name of his character), who was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the entire production was Ian McShane, who sucked as a villain and still demonstrated his acting skills. Despite the make-up jobs that this so-called "chameleon" used to dress up, it was just ridiculous things. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab, disguising himself as a South American dictator and American general. I do not care too. The plot was just not interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes, not to mention the one and a half hours. Just call it - Hawaii Five No!
