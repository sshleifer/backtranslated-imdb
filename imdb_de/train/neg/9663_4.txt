How cynical are the writers, so to pander. I'm an American, but I do not have to watch other Americans pat on my back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am amazed that so few have commented on how absolutely jingoistic, sentimental and banal the dialogue in this film really is. The film's historical inaccuracies are not as crude and offensive as in "U-571" (the British submarine driver turned into American), but you still feel a bit slimy. Really, the Germans in this movie admire the Americans between the fight scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I just want to say to the authors: For many of us, it's obvious that you can not catch real people with real problems and under real pressure, and that you've chosen some well-tested shortcuts. Fortunately, there are nationalist nut jobs that appreciate their sugar-coated tripe.
