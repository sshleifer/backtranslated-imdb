"Private Practice" is spun off from the rather successful and well written "Gray's Anatomy". The cast is fabulous. The premise could even work. But writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> The pre-pilot disguised as Gray's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The action was just blah. I thought it might be a coincidence. So I set the DVR to record the pilot and all other episodes on tape. <br /> <br /> As I watched the pilot, I wondered again and again how a show with such a cast of good actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot should attract people and make them come back. There should be excitement, flash, great writing, fascinating plot with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered during the rest of the season. Amazingly, this show had none of that. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a coincidence, I just saw the second episode and hoped for the best. And though it's a little better, it's not nearly as close as it needs to be to be interesting. I should not miss TV. <br /> <br /> I just wiped this show off my list of shows I want to watch. The effort is not worth it, and I would be very surprised if this show survives the mid season. Take care of these people.
