"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, letting his characters foul with cheap explosions, an American-style hit style, and giving them superpowers." "But, sir, have not we had several shows in the works that are already? much less than the dreams of their original creators. " "Yes, and these shows are making us a lot of money and we need more!" "But is not every man, woman and child who grew up with these less-grown characters upset?" "Hey, you're right! Set it in the future, make it all dependent on the original characters and change all the names a bit ... but not too much, but we still have to be able to melt the success of the classics." "<br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can imagine why this even exists, and if you look past the terrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons, it looks like an OK show But there's also the Teenie Titan, which is the same damned thing, all the characters are dressed like a Batman, they ride around in a kind of naval super villain, they have superpowers, just like the Looney tunes and have similar names and characteristics. <br /> <br /> This type of thing falls into the category "It's so ridiculous that it's good." Think of the Super Mario fraternal movie and Batman and Robin Check it out for all the wrong reasons, check it out, if you belong to the younger generation (what this thing is meant for), and make the greedy managers look shameless, then join in and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If If you like this cartoon, I will not do it. I have a problem with you, it's the people who've calculated this thing together that I'm mad at. You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car. This show is like a robbery. They might as well dig up all the people involved in the original cartoon, put them on display, dress them up in pirate costumes, and ask for money. If this show did not use characters (those that in no way resembled the Looney Toons) that already made the studios millions, that would be fine. But no! For the shame Warner brothers, for the shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag in an episode of Simpson's or Family Guy, I would love it. So I just can not believe that this was ever done. I would bet anyone that 80% of the people working on this show hate it. Whatever it does not matter, in 10 years this show will be forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world ends. "Coming 2008, Snoopy and The Peanut Gang is back, and now they have damn lasers and can become invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar?
