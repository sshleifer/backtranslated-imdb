Seriously crappy movie. <br /> <br /> First, the movie begins with a policeman and a partner parked in front of a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl they pulled to the loft of the warehouse while the policeman sits outside and thinks about what might happen up there. The "bad" cop finally returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the freshman cop does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in his pocket. He asks, gets a bullshit answer and then he thinks everything is alright (for the time being). <br /> <br /> The "bad" policeman repeats this process, and even once with a mens scene (done a little better). But at some point, people start going on, which took a while, considering how obvious it was. A girl gets a voodoo curse, just in case she dies, as you do. Now the "bad" policeman finally kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the body bagged in Duffel. <br /> <br /> Having created the Oogey Boogey magic, she comes up with a lot of eyeshadow, which indicates that she could be a zombie ... and the magical curse that all the other girls do to become "eye shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet a guy who appears to be a currency specialist and he offers them a ride (they obviously look normal to him). But when the girls see other people, such as a woman's husband, he freaks out because she's abominable (some people freak out, others do not even notice) ... massive storyline. <br /> <br To summarize, the eyeshadow monsters kill the "evil" policeman who ends up being a zombie in the final scene. It was as if they were preparing us for a sequel! How everyone wants Part 2 of this cow to fall.
