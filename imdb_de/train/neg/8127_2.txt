Currently, this movie is on the IMDb the 42nd worst movie ever made. That's why I rented it to NetFlix. However, I am saddened to report that the film, while bad, is not bad enough to be in the bottom 100 films ever made. I personally saw at least 100 movies that are worse than this. Hardly a fervent confirmation, but did not meet the expected level of fear that was to be included in this notorious list. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon, they are also married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupid (bad movie sign) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats like to attack people, and there are vampire bats in the US - neither is the case at all. Strangely enough, after being bitten, the man does not even bother going to the hospital !! The first thing everyone (especially a doctor) thinks about is getting medical help right away, but not those breasts. Soon he has seizures - still he is still not interested in finding help! You keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in movie history !! <br /> <br /> After a while, he finally goes to the doctor and is taken to the hospital. But until then it's too late and his attacks are getting heavier and he's starting to kill people to suck their blood. When everyone realizes that the man is a crazy killing machine, the woman (who like her husband has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to be dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance, and drives an ambulance police car off-road !! <br /> <br /> Now Moss goes through these episodes most of the time, his eyes are rolling back and he looks like a normal person. Strangely, however, he does develop bat-like hands a few times, and in the end, they use beautiful prosthetics to make him look like a bat. If this had really been cheesy, the film would have earned a 1. In the end, in a twist that made little sense, the woman inexplicably turned into a crazy bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. How this was all arranged was a mystery, as was Moss's and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their career - though both have been playing relatively long careers on television since 1974. <br /> <br /> Very stupid on the whole The plot is stupid and makes no sense and relies heavily on people being too stupid to be real. Not a good movie at all, but not one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb is showing the graphics for the three IT'S ALIVE DVD sets and two episodes of the BAT-PEOPLE website. While THE BAT PEOPLE was titled "It's Alive", the two films are not at all related. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since both came out in 1974, but the film I was reviewing starred with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other with John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
