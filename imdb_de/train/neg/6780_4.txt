This film was a critical fiasco at the box office in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a play that flopped on Broadway. The story is about some naval officers who had been on leave in San Francisco during the Second World War. You have 4 days of vacation at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film meanders and none of the characters looks very real. Generally, Cary Grant is brilliant at comedy and drama - but here he plays something of a wheeler dealer and he does not really make it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been the better choice. Audrey Hepburn was originally scheduled to play against Grant, but had other commitments - so Suzy Parker stepped in. She had never acted before, but was America's leading photo model at the time. I think she did a good job considering the pressure she was under. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a couple of short scenes - did not really work. The studio tried to give her something by playing with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
