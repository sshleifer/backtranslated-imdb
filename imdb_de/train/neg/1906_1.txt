They played this on the July 4th Twilight Zone Marathon and this is undoubtedly the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It is absolutely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although Twilight Zone is a rather uneven series and many episodes are sighing predictable at the end, this episode was completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes like "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun," and you realize there's no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with horrible stuff, and honestly, I'm surprised that someone would bow down to the level of this episode with his historical comedy. Even though he seems to have been trying, he MUST have needed the money ... there is no other explanation.
