Boring haunted thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder-suicide love triangle has taken place. <br /> <br /> The Novel setting is the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror movie by the director of Motel Hell. The film is tensionless and consists of slightly choppy scenes that seemingly rarely lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly early scene in which the male leader visits a temple after realizing that his house is being persecuted, as the monk had previously warned. The monk tells the story of the house (which the viewer already knows from the opening sequence), and the movie then just cuts off something else. Previously, the monk had offered help. Well, where is the help? The family remains in the haunted house as things get worse and worse, and the monk is mentioned just before the end, when he reappears to do what he should have done an hour earlier - try to drive the spirits out out of the house, although it is difficult for viewers to take care of it at this time. <br /> <br /> There are some (probably) unintentional pugnacious laughter when the American actors are suddenly occupied by the Japanese ghosts at the end. Begin to do bad martial arts, I probably say, because the scene is more than a bit reminiscent of the maid's head of the motel director of the same director, which was obviously meant to be rather amusing, but on the whole this is an unforgettable guy.
