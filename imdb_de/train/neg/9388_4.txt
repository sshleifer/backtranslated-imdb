The former private guard, who has turned his back on his eyes, is digging out his last job as a drone and immediately gets the chance to return to his former job. His mission: to pursue a mysterious Frenchwoman who has just arrived in California ... and was apparently sought by thugs wearing a suit and tie. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre without having enough sting or wit (or plot dynamics) in the script. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was edited without his involvement) does not look as if he appreciates the films of the 1940s that gave birth to his "Chandler"; His nostalgia is appropriately crumpled, but also bitter and somewhat indifferent. The handling is strange, praiseworthy low, and Warren Oates is well populated as a 70s variant of the "Private Dick" style, but the film has no snapshots. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - though neither has much to do and Caron's hot and cold running character is annoying. Lively cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice shooting, but it does not come to a boil. * 1/2 of ****
