I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 red mullets. That's a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, this movie is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need to be repaired. A streetwise and yet vulnerable heroine, a hardened former policeman with a heart of gold and a serial killer with "problems". Pure magic.
