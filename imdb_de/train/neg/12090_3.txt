Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film through his intrigues, I certainly thought that the painfully long way in which the scene structure took place was over-demanded by most viewers. Enormous holes in the script, such as the never-commented commentary "Your dad dies today" of the mother, make it even harder to try to understand those characters. <br /> <br /> This won first place in Cannes in 2001 is a shock, considering. Maybe the French were starving for Film Noir this year, desperate for something as sardonic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a means to make the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when he was connected with the inability to communicate with the main character, he went too far for me and kept me at a distance This is a film only for the most dedicated fan of Film Noir and for someone who does not expect any satisfaction after watching a movie once it's over. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were far more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in the direction of editing and tempo. Watching this slow and painful silence scene by scene just became so superfluous that I found it boring - and I really wanted to like this movie on every corner.
