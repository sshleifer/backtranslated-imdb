I do not know why I'm commenting on that stupid reality show that I just happened to watch some episodes of (a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something, but I did not look at it all three episodes) when I was nine months pregnant and going into labor every day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> Britney I'm sorry, I really do money and fame she seems to have very little sense of dignity. Or she is selfish to the utmost. She married the crazy Federline (okay, everyone can make a mistake) and before that she played this horrible show about her everyday life with him, where she puts a camcorder where she feels like, no matter if someone's in the face or in the shower, because Federline is in there. She babbles about her sex life without leaving anything to her imagination, I'm not interested in my role, but I can not wonder what she feels like now when she divorces. And yes, it makes me feel embarrassed. But I should not be. She seems to live a pretty empty, flat life. I do not want to trade her life, even if I could. Watching TV, if you want
