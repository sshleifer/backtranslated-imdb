This movie is a bad rip-off Friday 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie killing people for a camp counseling camp. He kills people because the camp counseling camp is located on land belonging to his father, and when the police came to forcibly capture his father's land, they accidentally killed his mother (another F13 launch). The intro sees Bernie killing his first victims. Then we meet a family camping in the same forest, and shortly after their arrival a strange old man joins in, who likes to talk about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he locked him up in the back of his caravan after he broke out of a psychiatric institute. He puts Bernie after the family so they can take their things with them and then the chase is on. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for those who love the B-Class of the 80s Slashers.
