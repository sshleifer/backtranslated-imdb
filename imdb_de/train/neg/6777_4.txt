Although I recently rated OPERATION PETTICOAT positively, I did not like this movie, even though it had so many similarities. Both were only a few years apart, both played Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. The overall sound and style of the films, however, were quite different. All in all, KISS HER FOR ME seemed like a cheaper movie - with bad writing, low energy and VERY broad performances - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think it's because Jayne Mansfield is busy. The combination of her great talents and limited acting skills made this A-budget movie look like it came from a third-grade studio. Besides, there was no chemistry or energy to pair with Cary Grant, an actor generally beloved for his grace and class. It's like combining Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
