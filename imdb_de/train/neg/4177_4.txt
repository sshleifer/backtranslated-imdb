Second film in a boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was pretty average. It's a bit boring in some areas, but there are some good gore effects, but they're not great. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the year 2210. Vampires have conquered pretty much the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) team, which also has its own spaceship and is led by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team led by Quintana (played by the very named Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (played by Aaron Pearl of Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets with the leader of the Vampire Muco, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall , He has no plans to live peacefully with humans because he is committed to world domination. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll get back in the DVD soon.
