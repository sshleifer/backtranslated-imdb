I saw the movie tonight for a free preview, and although I did not pay a dime to see this movie, I still felt torn apart. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and when you see this movie leave a Benjamin in your seat. The drama is torpid at best; Kiefer Sutherland is phoning in his worst imitation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to have made a bad choice and left Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time it took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is not an entity; she looks like she's reading her lines from a teleprompter. And if you can not spot the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, you've just landed on a world without television and recycled storylines on this planet. If you really want to see a good intelligence thriller, hire In The Line of Fire. If you see this and agree, you fear for the safety of the President, as the Secret Service looks and behaves like the adult versions of the 90210 genera. Art "does not imitate life.
