How many of these fake "Slice of Life" films still need to be made? Hopefully not too many. <br /> <br /> The raising of Victor Vargas is a very self-confident attempt by director Peter Solett to attract Hollywood's attention. There is nothing wrong with that. What's particularly wrong about this film is that it ignores the public and accumulates every clich√© in the book of supposedly "nervous" independent Hollywood production. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be "real", the rest of the film camera "documentary", except that no documentary filmmaker would deliberately shake the camera ... <br /> <br /> It's "edgy "so do not waste your time lighting the movie. <br /> <br /> It's "hip", so let the kids use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on and so forth. All you have left is a very self-confident attempt to impress Hollywood that will impress no one outside of the "diluted" indie mass that still resonates in every bad movie.
