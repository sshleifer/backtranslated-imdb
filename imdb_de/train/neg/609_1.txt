This was an absolutely terrible movie. Do not be tempted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this just has to be the worst role in the story. Even her great acting could not live up to the ridiculous story of this film. This film is a US propaganda piece of the early nineties. The most miserable scenes were those in which the Colombian rebels pleaded for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso looked fake, and her perverted love affair with walking was nothing but a pathetic emotional cut in a movie that had no real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are such films that ruin the good name of actors like Christopher Walken. I could hardly stand it.
