Reasoning for what has been set aside with his film in relation to distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists who have made script rewrites, we simply take this movie as it is offered without unnecessary explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful god. Just Craptastic. Instead of finding something that can serve as an action, I'm going to do a highlight roll with a few strange points where I had to scratch my head. A grade (out of 5) is taking part in a history class excursion into the middle of Ireland's nowhere. These students can be Canadian or American, that's hard to say. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than in Ireland is also pretty obvious. A student does not seem to know anything about the story and is basically the "stupid jock" from a series of 80's kick-ass movies, except when channeling Randy from Scream. A character may be the stunt double of Chris Klein. He has a girlfriend who is likely to be killed, but it's never really known if that's true. A character is grumpy and distant from their peers ... just ... because ... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is often referred to as the "sir." He is very threatening and wears a knit hat. His cousin is an angry porn star with the worst Irish accent that should hit a movie in my life, and probably beyond. <br /> <br /> In picturesque Ireland, there are many Canadian forests and marshy areas, as well as 2 ducks that cut scenes more than once. <br /> <br /> The producers got a discount on fake guts. Good for you. <br /> <br /> Unknown, terrible inbred freaks have access to brand new hunting knives. There may be a kind of outdoor team nearby with a blind and deaf employee working the registry. <br /> <br /> Even without knowing it, if you are enchanted for about 600 years, as the story makes us believe that you are done a bit lumpy, but amazingly spry and pretty strong. Genetics is a wonderful dice game. <br /> <br /> There can only be one freak in this movie. It is referred to as "she" and we see shadows, but only a weird-looking guy is ever seen. And when a weird-looking guy is eventually killed, all danger seems to have passed. I assume with my original assumption that no one thought of equipping a second man in full make-up, so they only used one. At least that's what it looks like on screen. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Apart from these shiny new knives, the inbreeding freaks also have access to some fancy leather stuff, as Richard Grieco once cuts his shackles, gives it freshness for the next jerk, who gets tied up ... who then escapes because the chains give you enough play to undo them. Even the trouble of captivating someone. <br /> <br /> A corpse in a hut will be freed from maggots after what I suspect has been about 2 hours. The corpse will also wear glasses if no characters carry them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears without a reason from the stage on the left, chats for 2 minutes and disappears the stage. In the middle of a huge forest. This is not unusual, because Gary can also emerge from nowhere, which is also known when what exists on television ends up on the screen. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes disappear like my hope that this film would not suck a wind. <br /> <br /> I would like to give a special sign to the "Breeder" character, the poor girl used by the freaks, for months (or perhaps years) of breeding. The poor girl who still wears eyeshadows and emotes with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was clearly tackled by a drunk or someone with an angry mental disability who was cultivated and encouraged over the years with excessive gasoline drinking. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was not a coincidence that I found late at night on the film network, apparently people have heard of it and even followed it through its production film. How sad for you all. I do not have anything to say in addition. May God have mercy on all of us.
