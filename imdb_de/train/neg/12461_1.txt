Unlike most of the other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family found the film on DVD at home was a complete waste of time and space. In short, this was a movie based on a script whose writer was far too smart. Instead of trying to narrate a complex story in an intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that vignettes of various story lines from a dozen "story lines" were always vaguely and hard to connect to each other for 30 seconds clear view. No, sir, it does not. What makes for a great reputation is absolute clarity, precision, action, and storylines - and characterizations - that have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This kind of cinematic presentation - similar to the dim-sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is extremely modest and unintelligent. Thank God, then, for the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, the director and actors knew the value of clear storytelling, diction, and acting that meant something. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that will not make this family again.
