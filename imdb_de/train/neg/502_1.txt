Not only is this film a very bad movie, with terrible actors - or suspected actors -, a bored director and an unattractive story, it also copies exactly one scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso" by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years previously), one of the most famous psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult movie around the world. In La Sanguinusa conduce la danza, the director repeats the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, watching a peeping tom from a window in the bedroom. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of Martino's film. To tell another black girl, another white girl, and another peeping tom playing the scene is simply the best proof that Rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. I think that such things are an insult to the viewer.
