I was never sure where this thing went. These people seem to be interested in what's going on on any mountain. They research, have narrow escape routes, go back, come back, go in danger, put each other in danger, become sleepwalking, are attacked by witches with uniform wardrobes, etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her exposed many times. She is taken off, he gets her back and leaves her again. They get the point. The whole thing seems to come to a kind of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the pressure is so bad that twenty seconds of blackness is not uncommon. Is this due to the age or excessive use of night filters?
