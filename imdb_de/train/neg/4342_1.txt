I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go on, but then it was all so bad. First of all, the cast is all wrong, where does the van Peeble (crap actor btw) and the Puff Daddy come from ??? It looks as if Carlito had come off the hood and been hanging around with some real idiots. This movie does not do justice to Carlitos Way. I am so happy that the sequel "Carlito's Way" came out first. If I had seen this trash first, I would never have given the Pacino version a chance. In any case, Pacino should have read this story, thought it was crap and instead the sequel. Carlito's Path: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's way - 9 out of 10 points.
