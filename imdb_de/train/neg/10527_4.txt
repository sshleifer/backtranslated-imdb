I discovered this movie at a retailer selling OOPs. And this one is certainly an OOP. A year after the exorcist, she's back in business with this movie, but what we all were new about was that Blair's career never broke out, she never became a megastar. That's one of the reasons why many of their films are OOP. She does a good job in this movie. It's about a rejection that is not recognized by their parents and has no friends. At the age of 15, I played a girl of 14, that's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers, where they put a broomstick in their virginity. In most issues it's cut out, why, I do not know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A, so nothing to offend people. But the movie is slow, extremely slow. Normally I am not happy, but I almost fell asleep. It's just that the 14-year-old becomes a rebel against society, but there's no blood, no blood and nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a miracle to me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy him if you can find him, or leave him as he is.
