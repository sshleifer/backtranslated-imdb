As I sat down to watch the 14th season of the Bachelor ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew that I would have an "interesting" time. I had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor pass by; watch one or two episodes and miss the next three or so. I think the bachelor is often appealing and fascinating, though his quality and morals are often not enough. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" describes the journey of Jake, a 31-year-old professional pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, a true love, as in a seasonal reality Can find drama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He starts to get to know her a bit, but it's mostly superficial. how do you get to know someone in a few minutes? Jake tries to make his true intent known from the beginning, at least to the audience. He noticed that he does not want to have only love or a good time, but a fianc√© or a woman. We can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition. If this is the case, this could explain some actions of the women. The women are super competitive. Although they do not even know Jake, they are still there to win, regardless of the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only were the women competitive, they were also self-confident and cranky. Threats, Ambushes and Warnings of "Caution!" Everyone shows that these women were not there for a good time. Jake noticed that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection. However, the girls have pulled out all stops to impress Jake with the sex appeal. They arrived in tight clothes in the villa. either low or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain their sense of coziness, others completely missed this memo. One girl, Channy, noted that Jake was a "good guy" for whom she could be a "naughty girl". She said that Jake could always land on her runway. She was wronged by the other girls for her provocative statement, which showed her attitude to these situations. <br /> <br /> So, a reality dating show might not be that bad, right? In addition to the obvious problem of sex-related attraction, there are other issues that affect this seemingly harmless show. Is this the right way to find a future partner? to compete with someone by posing extreme proportions? Unfortunately, America has reduced this dating to this day: lust and sex without commitment and a little luck. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many girls tie themselves to Jake. Especially a few girls seemed to be overly connected. One girl said, "If I do not get that first impression, I'll kill myself!" As already mentioned, they do not even know him and she spoke of a certain rose, not just one of the 15 roses that should not be excluded. Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some problems with the attachment to Jake. The other girls noticed it too. After an outburst from Michelle, Vienna claimed that Michelle "had a nervous breakdown and we've only been here for an hour". Michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show? almost missing elimination? and was very emotional about it. The other girls just thought it was ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor and from then on it just started ??? Reality TV. It shows our entertainment interests as a country. If we did not see the shows and give them good reviews, the networks would stop them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is addictive. One thing is clear: America generally loves reality TV and the ensuing trappings. <br /> <br /> This begs the question: Why do we like Reality TV anyway? What attracts us? Is it because we see similarities with our own lives, or do we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever attracts us, we should pay attention to the media and entertainment that we allow ourselves to fill our thoughts. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad. However, I say that we have to evaluate each one individually. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for the review: Season Premier and Episode 2.
