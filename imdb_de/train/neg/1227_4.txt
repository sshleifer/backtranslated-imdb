Although many people praise this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic. I think that Basinger does decent acting, but you can not make a thriller if you lack realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good picture of the movie: while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs, she decides to sit down and look at a picture from her bag. The picture is of her daughter and it reads "we love you mom". Who does this? What is the effect? And believe me when I say that it's not nearly as stupid as other scenes in the movie. Someone said this was a "hidden gem". I absolutely do not have to agree, this movie has been hidden for a reason. And it is not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to comment on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Normally, the lack of logic does not bother me when it's in small amounts, but this movie is basically made possible only because of the lack of logic. But I still give him a 4, because although it is embarrassing in logic, it has a certain mood that has been watching me until the end was warned.
