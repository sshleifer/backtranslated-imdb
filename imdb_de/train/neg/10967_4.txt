Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad behavior, tedious scripts, wood lines, improbable situations and the like. I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on so many levels. For all the reasons above and many more. This includes the nonsensical, crass use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to male genitalia in a very Freudian way. I am convinced that this is purely out of incompetence. Unlike trying to do something really different. I mean, any film that takes years to film can not sustain the concord and concentration demanded by the modern audience. Unfortunately, it was supposed to happen when we saw how things developed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can express is that the picture was amazing in the end. If this had been used initially instead of the end, it might have allowed the film to begin at the point where it ended in 2001 ... Pity they did not try that instead. I just do not understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be done. Was it the conspiracy? It could not be sure. Was it the characters? I doubt that; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was it the dialogue? No, no. The music? Perhaps, but more likely, the headmaster's unvarnished ego must be deleted. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts have died on the floor of the cutting room.
