I do not understand why people would praise this garbage. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, terrible and just about everything else. The film offers a glimpse into life, issues of race, prejudice, and everything else that is odd in college. Here it fails. It does not affect the reality. From many dubious nonsensical scenes in the film, such as <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man and the security guard stopped and handcuffed and executed during the shooter Runs straight past them. <br /> <br /> The same white man breaking down people from a roofing theme stopped and knocked down by the same black man is then arrested and beaten with a Rodney King style while the gunman runs A moment later he was chased back by only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As a previous reviewer has pointed out, several white men of 230 lbs were beaten down by several black men weighing around 160 lbs including the 105lbs bust of A <br /> <br /> Another critical flaw in the movie is the flat, uninteresting main characters. From the frightened and confused whites and the evil, angry and legitimate (?) Blacks. It's almost an insult to blacks and whites. I am a white man and know many black and Hispanic Americans who agree that in this film it is wrong to portray characters and give them these characteristics solely on the basis of their race. The plot that I'm explaining now revolves around three characters. One is a black athlete, the other a confused scared white girl questioning her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared and then owes his troubles to black people in which he later in the movie Nazi will. They all have their share of problems and adventures, including sex, rape, struggles, love, hate, prejudice, racial war and oh well, do not forget about education. What comes down at the end for the deadly shot. After they return to their boring life and think, "To be white is bad". Does that sound a lot like your college days? I did not think so. I do not think the director visited college, especially if he made that terrible mess. Overall, this is a really bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want to see a more detailed view or race issues, read American History X. If you would like to see a more detailed view of Porky's college rental. Just avoid this mess.
