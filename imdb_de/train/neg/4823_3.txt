Lame plot and two-dimensional characters look like cardboard cutouts. It is needless to say that it was difficult to feel compassion for the characters, especially for the fiancé. He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, it could be said that it was comparable to your typical TV drama. It uses almost every cliche in the book. The tortured classic who wants to break out and play salsa. The free-spirited fiancé became engaged to a personality she does not love. I will not perform it, otherwise it would be a spoiler, because I would betray the whole conspiracy. The dancing was ok, but nothing special. I have seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was very close. I saw it on YouTube. Luckily I did not pay good money to see it in a theater. I'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has produced.
