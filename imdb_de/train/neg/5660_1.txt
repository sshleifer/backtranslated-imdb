I'm glad to read so many negative comments on the Tritter Plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like House's rugged nature and intelligence, but they really do not like the negligence of this continued conspiracy. It interferes with the true nature of hospital history and makes everyone mad at the police. It has to be more caring instead of being vengeful for everyone in the hospital. Also, there seems to be quite questionable legal issues about what Tritter actually does. He alone can not freeze the accounts and keep doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the vindictiveness he shows hurts even the very sick patients in the hospital, and it's not a good plot to portray. I did not make the episode terrible because of the story itself, but inserting the Trittor piece will scare me off and hurt the rest of the plot. Please change it. Get Tritter out.
