As a graduate of film studies, I would like to think that I have seen several films, some good ones and others, but I have to say that "summer rain" is by far the worst film I have ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it would become a great British classic like "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock", but oh no, that was so bad that my roommates and I laugh in the end and the ridiculous Acting laugh and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad school production "Theater in Education"). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the beginning. "Michelle," the main character who lives with her two friends, has the face that you would never get tired, and Gary was so wet (he burst into tears every 5 minutes) that I'm real until the end of the movie did not worry about either. I could only think, "I paid 3 pounds for this bunch". I have never written a review, but after seeing this movie, it has made me warn people against this catastrophic production. So please avoid! Thank you for reading.
