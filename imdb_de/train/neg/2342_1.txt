I do not know what would be great about this movie. Worse, why would anyone bother? First, there is no story. You could say that a movie could be worth a look even without a story because it makes you feel strong (laughter, scream, fear, ...), but in my opinion, this movie does not. <br /> You see only +/- 2 hours of pictures. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the movie is an experiment and it's daring because everything is missing. But is that worth 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money? For me, the answer is no.
