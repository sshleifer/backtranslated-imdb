This is a really bad movie. I've been shaking my head and can not think of a positive comment. The spectacle is cruel. I have seen more credible cable access benefits. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president, and a shark attacking anything close to him would have been cheesy at worst. Night of the sharks is not even so bad that it is good. The dialogue sounds and is sent as if it were seconds before filming. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am amazed that my ears did not blow from the 80s, when technosynthetic sounds were created that actually bothered someone to record the sharks are like a last nail in the coffin.
