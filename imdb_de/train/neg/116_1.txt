I can not believe that those who praise this movie do not think of another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or its absence) makes a movie that is also pointless. On the positive side, the general crafting level of the actors and the technical crew is quite competent, but if you have the ear of a sow to work with, you can not make a silk handbag. Ben G fans should be with almost every other movie he was in. Dorothy S fans should stay with Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter at the expense of those who seemingly ask for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book Killing of the Unicorn.
