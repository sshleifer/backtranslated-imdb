I can not believe that so many compare this movie to Argentos. His work is far more imaginative and vicious - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes - and let's face it, that's what this genre is about - are not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the killer was, and I really did not care when it was revealed. Cinematography is not memorable, and the much-vaunted Gothic atmosphere of the 19th century simply did not attract me. Some of the actors are pretty good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl she introduces to the younger students), but there is very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but amazingly, they add very little spice or tension. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
