I almost burst into tears when I saw this movie. Not from laughter, but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had him at his best and Back To School is by far a classic 80s masterpiece. Then there was ladybugs and that was when it started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a small step away from the ladybirds, but did not say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives, Rodney Monte plays (a name he must love, as he was named in Easy Money). A rich (not always) man who loves and marries women as if he were nothing. Well, now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was farmed by the Amish, he inherits 5 wives. That sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is EVERYTHING. The script is so bad that Rodney seems to be saying his deposits to the camera and all the minor characters have nothing to do with it. The movie looks like it was shot on video with some really bad stunt sequences that are not obviously Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he's saying the F-word (which he should because the movie is rated R, but it's like PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute cameo. Do not get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at Rodney's jokes, but the poor man gets way too old and way too slow. We can see his jokes from afar. And the movie becomes much more PC, the Rodney does not work anymore thanks to the terrible 90's, 70's and 80's.
