Okay, only if you read the title, you would think that it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did it. It started well, but got boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It tells a story of a mother who is so desperately looking for a cheerleader that she will do anything to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's girlfriend is in the way of the girl. She always wins the competitions and therefore drives the mother towards "elimination". After a conversation with a "hitman", the mother decides that the girl has to be roughened a bit. So action is taken, but eventually she gets caught. <br /> <br /> The cast is terrible and the movie takes too long without anything happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
