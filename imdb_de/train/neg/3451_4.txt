Frank Sinatra was not an ideal western actor. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with the Golden Arm are proof of that, but he did not have the image of a Western hero, you've identified him as an urban type. But he tried to do well in Johnny Concho. The fact that the movie had failed at the box office was not his fault. I blamed it on two reasons: a) The story was too unusual, especially because Sinatra is more like a villain in the movie than a hero. In a genre where people expect a certain pattern, the movie has to be very good to get rid of. b) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole city allows Sinatra to do anything it wants just because they are afraid of its brother. Even if a man shows him a special holster that can be opened sideways so he does not have to pull the weapon, wonder if that makes him invincible, why did not all the shooters adopt it? I think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because every movie with Sinatra is worth seeing and despite its shortcomings still enjoyable
