What can I say, this is a brilliant filmmaking that should have won an Oscar. A copy should be kept in a safe vault for posterity. It should be viewed for all students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most ingenious writer / director / producer / boss / babysitter / walmart greeter, who has ever adorned the world of cinema with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he's so attractive that I'm surprised he did not choose Mr. Universe. I could not stop myself during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie to my brother, and he called me over the phone and said that Arthur's nude scene made him gay. Of course I'm totally supportive because this movie is beautifully designed lessons in tolerance. Why yesterday I just burned down a church and wrote "For Sam and Arthur" in its smoldering ashes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing about this movie. As this Fed-Ex plane climbed into the midst of the Vermont Palm trees, I cried! I never knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel with Fed-Ex planes before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's writing, acting, directing, composing, casting, production, production design and real estate school. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich, thank you for bringing this creation into the world, we can never pay you enough."
