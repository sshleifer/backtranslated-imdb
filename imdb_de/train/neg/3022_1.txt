I was very excited about this movie when I saw the previews for the first time. Usually I see a good preview and buy the movie directly. Something has told me ... you should see it first. I am glad that I did it. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. When the 2nd pirate movie came out, I looked at it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think it had to do with her hair and make it short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I did not care about her character and even Keira, who was partially naked, did not value the movie. The direction was definitely missing. The writing was banal and superficial. The editing was terrible. I do not care so much about the style as the bad overuse. There is a place for it. Good examples of choppy MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there is an official name) would be Fight Club. just out of my head. Even the enemy of the state had a semi-similar style of cut. It was tastefully used and not used as a crutch. I mean, that's the same guy who staged Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who liked this movie. I think the idea that you either completely love or hate this movie is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
