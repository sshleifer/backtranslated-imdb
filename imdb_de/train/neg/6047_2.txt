What worked the French Connection so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe, directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us gems like Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his unique obsession to capture Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseille with the help of the French authorities Charnier is funny. Correct me if I am wrong, but Charnier did not skip the city with 65 pounds of pure shit !!! A street value of 32 million, but yes, let's send Doyle to find this guy, it was his pinch. You're welcome!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the sole exception of Hackman, who completely over-played his role). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were awful. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip it.
