Oh dear ... as an Englishman and a small part of Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins's work in the industry ... I'm really disappointed to this day. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm a nobody hoping for improvement. So my comments are "straw in the wind". But that's the point, right? - I have no ax that is oriented to the economic value of a job. I, a full member of the big unwashed, go to a movie to be moved to another location. Yes, expose the faith for a short time. But not get into a state of absolute unbelief. <br /> <br /> Had this been from an unknown author and director, I would guess that this "production" would have been forgotten. Unfortunately not, and I was left wide-eyed and confused. After seeing some of the rave reviews of this work, I'm a little worried ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll try to watch every movie on its own merit. Regardless of author, director, studio or even the prominence of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, so many before me: Do not write and do not run the same production. It is dangerous. Movies need to be moderated to get a sense of credibility. <br /> <br /> As you say in school reports, "Could and could better ..."
