If you ever hear those three words that are being uttered to you ... "Joe Don Baker," you're scared ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is the low-action movie that starred on a sheriff a city in Texas, Geronimo, based (pronounced as Heronimo). He's an ugly, slimy, rude character looking for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually falls twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in prison four or five times in the film, so the action is nowhere fast. He also shoots everyone as if he were in the Wild West. I think nobody told him it was the 20th century. A policewoman is to show him Malta (which looks like Elaine from Seinfeld), and she is the only one who can bear the Redneck. She must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Her dance is shown throughout the movie and I began to connect with the sloppy women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to figure out something. The end is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy it was finally over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond films ... very funny! Anyway, if you feel like laughing, check out MST3K this time. I have also heard his other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version is released by Rhino on DVD. I can not wait to see that!
