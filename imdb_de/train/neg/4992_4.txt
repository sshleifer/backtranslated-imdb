This movie is just another average action movie, but it could have been so much better. When the guns came out, they really needed some choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that shiny action sequence in Heat as he heads up the street from the robbery - would have made the boring action sequences special. Because the rest of the movie was alright - predictable, but observable - better than you would expect from this kind of movie. Then came the last scene, the showdown, the one we had been waiting for, but it was like seeing some of the A team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing strikes and they run around a house to kill each other - the same age, the same age.
