Another great movie by Costa Gavras. It is a great illustration of the situation in Latin America and US involvement in Latin American politics. The facts may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and the support of Latin American dictatorships. Nevertheless, the spirit of the film follows the typical left / communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa Gavras is a well-known Communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he portrays the US actions as brutal and inhumane while he considers the extremist activities of Tupamaros to be positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America to be involved as the US. Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I've never heard that poor girls from Uruguay or Chile are massively prostituting, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The US waged a dirty war, and God bless us, the whole monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is unfortunate that the US had to do what they did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film follows the corrupt and bankrupt left-wing ideology of yesteryear and tries to call it idealistic and moral.
