Thank God! I did not waste my money on renting, but I downloaded it! This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, visual effects, unnecessary blood and nudity! Far from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many loopholes and mistakes in the movie. OK, if you have time after reading this comment, please check the director's profile (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I myself explained why the movie is like that, I mean that every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. Finish with a strong sentence. Even if you're having fun or time, or even in an extremely bored situation, DO NOT watch this movie.
