It seems that this is the only movie John Saxon has ever shot, and that he had the good feeling to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it is boring and wooden, without much to offer. A Vietnamese war hero takes on a job for a mob boss, gets a bit too friendly with the woman, and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself and the war hero, who is framed and sent to jail, especially on death row. Now, this prison has experimented with inmates and is testing a formula that will make men the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes awry and then all those infected people are locked up in jail, some of them becoming zombies and the rest, who suddenly just do not want to be there anymore. It just keeps going on and on, nothing much to show or say for yourself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed like it came a few times, but no, it was apparently just prepared for takeoff other and equally boring way. If you watch to the end, you may become a zombie yourself, so do not risk it. 2 out of 10.
