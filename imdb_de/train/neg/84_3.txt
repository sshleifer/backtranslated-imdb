As a kid, I thought the killer's weapon was cool, but I was a kid, so I was a little stupid. Even a stupid child, though the movie was stupid and a bit boring if the killer did not kill people with his light knife. What baffles me is that the film has a really solid cast. What kind of script did they read when they agreed to be in this movie because it is certainly boring and just a means to show a lightsaber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is completely chaotic. The whole movie seems to be about aliens and guns. The plot has two kids and some guys who had an alien encounter, flash years later and it seems there's a return, sort of in the mix. Dead animals and those to be explored, and for whatever reason, one guy gets the alien weapon and begins to perform a very light killing action. Seriously, all you have to do is wonder why this movie was made, if you want a killer, have some good death scenes when you show alien encounters that show more than a weird twirl, and when you do Lightsaber and call yourself Star Wars.
