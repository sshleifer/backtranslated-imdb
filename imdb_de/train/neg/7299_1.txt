Sure, I've seen bad movies in my life, but this was so bad that I got angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director and asked him to refund my movie ticket. Of course, I did not receive any refund (or no answer), but it depends. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a -42. Why did the "jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop running because it was struck by a thug? Why did you first hit the "jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat instead of cracking the bum's skull? The plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clich√©s and certain parts of it just did not make sense.
