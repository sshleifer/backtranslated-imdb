Rarely has such an amazing cast been so much wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped on board to be torpedoed by a script that looked like a Hollywood joke. Linking the name Martin Scorsese with it was probably the draw, but the end result is much less than the sum of its parts. Like a nightmare that has gone terribly wrong, each scene seems more than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing but abstract, stylish, selfish nonsense, and the whole movie is very boring .......... MERK
