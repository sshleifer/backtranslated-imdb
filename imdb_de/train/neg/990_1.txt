Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate hired her because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about travelers trapped in a cave). So we decided to see it anyway and thought it could not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was actually produced and made available to the public. It was so awful that it was almost like an accident scene where you wanted to look away, but you just can not do it. I feel genuinely emotionally frightened. It went from a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl is attacked by a boy with whom she runs out, to a mature porn. And not really good. I hated the rapist of the woman and felt almost bad for him. Nearly. All in all, a horrible movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your kids see it.
