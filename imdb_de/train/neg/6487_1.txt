Well, thank you for destroying so much Disney for destroying the beautiful memories I had of my former favorite movie. I was about five years old when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first films I remember. Now that I'm 16 and feel masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. So I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sad excuse for a movie. This film takes everything that has made the original charming, and destroys it to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter Melody and show her all in the sea ... STAGE STYLE! After the musical number is completed within minutes, the sea appears, in which Morgana appears and threatens to kill Melody, if Triton does not give up the trident. So he gives it up without a fight. Eric stands gaping, though Ariel finds out how he uses a sword and saves Melody. Morgana flees, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the ocean until Morgana gets caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... um, nothing special really happens. Eric is a total kiss. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel somehow does something. Melody manages to screw things up. In addition, the animation is a new low for Disney. Computer graphics collides with the backgrounds. Every single opportunity for character development is wasted. Biting the songs. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste time. I'm pretty sure even the little kids will get bored out of their skulls because nothing happens, which is exciting even from a distance. They do not want to sing the songs. If you manage to get a copy of it, throw it in the ocean and hope it never finds anyone. Ever.
