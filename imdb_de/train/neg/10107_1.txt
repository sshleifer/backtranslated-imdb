Last weekend, I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain basket and saw it with some friends, thinking it was a budget version of Land of the Dead. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems they spend a good deal of their cover art budget, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We've got to the point where the zombie chicks come to life and get into the car with a yuppie in the middle of nowhere talking on a cell phone. They actually talk to the man before one of the girls kills him; But once they started the car, I could not stop my unbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people think that is a "bad, good" movie, they are liars. I did not finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mentioned that they somehow become policemen at the end of the movie, which makes me glad I did not see it all the way. <br /> <br /> This is worse than "Zombiez" NOT GROWING!
