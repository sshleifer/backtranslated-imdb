Okay, I saw the preview of this stupid movie. First of all, the movie is so posed and not real that they all work. You can not sing. You are too full of yourself. It is awful. Yes, kids like 8-10 can enjoy it, but it's really stupid. I mean, they say that their manager is a kid. And the record label is fake. It is stupid. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to decor and direction, not so bad. It's a cute documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See this only if you do not really like good music. It is also very hackneyed. It is not even tasteful. I hate being so mean ... but that's really a piece of garbage.
