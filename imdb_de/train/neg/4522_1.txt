The most misogynist movie of all time? Not to mention '68, would not they have moved over white brown-faced people who play the "Indians"? However, my favorite parts have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers pull them into gang rape. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then there is the blatant rip-off of "The Hustler" (the fat Bosscharakter actually plays pool, while he plans to destroy the Indians with the main character of the rebels), the terrible spectacle, the so-on-the-nose You-you-might-have-just-said-you-have-to-think-music-notes, the absence of EVERYONE who is REALLY Indian in this movie. And with whom should we root ourselves? I have to say that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to argue for strong women, I've learned from at least one source that he's a misogynist in real life. Why did I see it, you ask? Do not ask.
