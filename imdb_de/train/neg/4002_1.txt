The social commentary was too much, and the mystery itself was built up and solved by a series of unbelievable coincidences that were completely unimaginable. In the last ten years nothing has changed in the personal life of Fitz, which makes him interesting from a distance. <br /> <br /> I even had trouble understanding why he complained about his stay in Australia, compared to the possibilities of solving the secrets he has in England. Can not he stay with the Australian police? It seems to be a very artificial conspiracy to involve him in a crime investigation. The last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and this one picks up this coat instead of returning to the focus of the first series. Sad.
