Jungle Fever is too stylized, stereotyped, and essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there are many talents in this film, it is mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Instead of just showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is, Spike Lee decides to wave it like a flag in a most lamenting and irritating way. I survived most of the film, but could not quite finish it, and that rarely happens to me.
