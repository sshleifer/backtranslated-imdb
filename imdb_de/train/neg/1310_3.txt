The plot is straightforward. An old man living on a main road in the woods will one day witness a man murdering a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to convince the police that what he saw was not a fantasy of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man leads the police to where the murder took place and no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a tiny dialogue that reflects the majority of the film's scenes, an old man living alone in a house. During the film, I realized that I was scared twice, when the murdered child abruptly appeared in front of the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit has not bothered me; I found the tempo of the movie a bit too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the story's development and its conclusions after watching the film took too long. I think you could have made more out of the relationship, the ghostly encounters with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night, insecure mind can lead to sinister situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
