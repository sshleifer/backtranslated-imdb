I saw the "woman on the beach" of this director and could not understand the good to great reviews. This movie is similar to the one, two people who are trapped in a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest for everyone else. Like his other films, you have to listen to the empty dialogue, do not wade through a lot, and get enchanted by signed, rather uninteresting characters. If you feel that you like this movie, do not let my review stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I think Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior. In Lee Kang-Sheng, he has a pretty grandiose actor in his films. Here is nothing. I wish IU liked it, but I do not do it. Well.
