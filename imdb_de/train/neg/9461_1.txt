The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face. Mike Myers as The Cat in Hat is downright funny and Mike Myers could not have been worse. This is his worst movie ever. The acting and the story were just awful. I mean, how could you get the most popular stories from Dr. Make Seuss into a movie that is one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment. I could not have seen a worst movie than this, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how badly he made this movie. Bo Welch should be fired or the author should do it. <br /> <br /> Hedegens View: 0/10 No stars F
