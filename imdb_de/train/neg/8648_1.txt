Well, basically the movie goes! It is Blair Witch meets Sean Penn's ill-conceived fantasy of going to Iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" really means. The script sounds like it was written by the 8th student (no insult to 8th grade students); the two leading actors work across the entire film; They used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong kind of movie (not that I knew anything about these things - but it just did not look like real documentaries I've seen), and worst of all Christian Johnson was a great idea and made to suck it. It reminded me of the time I was trying to draw a picture of my dog, and in the end I had a really bad figure that looked more like a huge crap. I'd rather see the Blair Witch VIII than get through it again.
