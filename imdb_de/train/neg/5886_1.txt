I would have half left the film if I had not been with people who liked it. The film is based on real incidents, but is so exaggerated that it does not feel real at all. I have a psychological background, hang out with many psychotherapists, and know seriously crazy people. So it's not like I think that such people do not exist. In the film, however, only Auguste's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin) seemed to be the people who looked thoroughly human. (Although Evan Rachel Wood was a fascinating distraction - very sexy with a bad sense of fun). There were a few amusing moments, but the overall tone of the film was grim, bizarre and evil. What a waste of a great cast! When I watched them go through their curves, I just felt like watching acting classes. This was brought home during the credits, when a few people were shown sitting there, not acting, not talking. These few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
