I went to this movie and expected a short film that covered the effects of Sam's son on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force-feed me more garbage for reasons of race, mass justice, or the inability of the ordinary citizen to make a decision under peer pressure. Lee has an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The entire movie could have been more effective if it was in a 90-minute format with more focus and fewer tangential subterranean tracks. <br /> <br /> Don 'You do not have to rent the video unless you enjoy Spike Lee out of passion. In this case, the theater is worthwhile. This is not an escapist movie.
