I had the misfortune to waste 10 pounds on buying a new SS movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually expose my belief by watching movies like this one. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark night on the sofa and a loud late night shoot is perfect for an alpha guy like me. I bought this movie and thought I would see cool martial arts and shoot them. <br /> <br /> I have hell. Segal is old and bloated, the conspiracy was ridiculous even for SS standards and to cut it all off, Segal's acting (as it was at the beginning) is exceptionally bleak. So horrible, in fact, that half of his voice was dubbed by a man who sounded like NOTHING like HIM. Either the SS can no longer be so terrible (a point of contention) of the crew that they could not properly record the sound. The voice wavered between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who makes voice-offs for Honda advertising, back and forth! nothing new there. The usual mix of characters dying as cannon fodder and stereotypical villains waiting to be blown away. <br /> <br /> Extremely garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
