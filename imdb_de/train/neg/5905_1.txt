Do not see this. This was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like these. What a sad view of the life of the Mormons. I can tell you, if you've seen this movie, it's not like that in a single station. If it did, I do not think I would have done it. It's too bad that most Mormon films are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. The acting was so bad that my wife and I barely made it. I think you could say that it had all the signs of a B movie. or are there C movies? Anyway ... I just thought, this film was shit and full of cheese. I wish some Mormons would start making high quality films.
