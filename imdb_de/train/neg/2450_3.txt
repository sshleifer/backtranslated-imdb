I looked at the Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I halfway read the Two Towers. I thought it was absolutely brilliant. At that time, the animated version of Lord of the Rings appeared on DvD, but I told myself that I would read the Two Towers and the Return of the Kings before I look at them (when I thought she was showing the entire trilogy) went and brought the DvD with, which was a stupid idea, because it was absolutely garbage. <br /> <br /> I was bored for 20 minutes, which was really strange because I love the book and shook the guy. This movie could even be thought of turning at least one and a half books into a 2-hour 8- to fit in a minute movie. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had any emotions when they talked, and they seemed to be. When I read it from a page, even my favorite character Gandalf did not seem to care at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only OK in parts of the movie except the orcs (they looked awful) and Aragorns and Sam's face. <br /> <br /> I do not know what this movie looks like was released because there was not even a real ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the movie could not get any better. <br /> <br /> I just hope nobody will judge the books by this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
