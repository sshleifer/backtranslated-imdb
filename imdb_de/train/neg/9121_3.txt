This is not a terrible comedy, but it is very dull. It barely laughs and wastes its lavish output. There is a poignant moment in the end when Fu Manchu offers his "Nemesis" a dose of his elixir and says, "You were my worthy opponent, now we can start all over again". However, this scene, along with Burt Kwouk's amusing cameo at the beginning, is the only memorable part of the movie. (* 1/2)
