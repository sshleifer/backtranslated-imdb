A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD case from his ***. <br /> <br /> I was excited by the prospects of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels have brought me a lot of entertainment and the previous script adaptations were great, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who did the casting had to sleep there. I can imagine that the castings went like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I like fish very much." "Wonderful, you're hired. Do you have some money." <br /> <br /> Then there is the script. I've read Chabon, which I hope he got blind before he saw this piece of Dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why it annoyed me so much, but it may have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90-year-old, drunken duck hunter with a right-sided dysfunction of the lobes would have been a pleasure. The one-liners of this second-degree model -Massakers spit out children. <br /> <br /> This is an actual line from the movie; "If you tell me something you've never said aloud before, that moment will be unique!" Unique? Makes it? Is it really doing it? Of course not you plank. Please give me the Imodium. I'll have a whole jerk. <br /> <br /> The director is ... good. I do not have anything. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber got word that his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directorial comedies. No holding of commercials. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that I hit my head against a wall so hard that it brought me back to the Stone Age. I give him 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who saw a 1-star movie.
