I can not describe how awful this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the animated art totally disgusting? The men of Rohan look with their badly colored hair to 100% fake, which does not look nearly as the performers look. The orcs looked terrible. Why is Gandalf badly limp? Why can not you pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others who sounded like terrible pronunciation of Tolkien characters. All in all, I am glad that the studio from which this was made, has pulled the plug from the Sequal. Check out the Hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkien's work. Damn, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2.10
