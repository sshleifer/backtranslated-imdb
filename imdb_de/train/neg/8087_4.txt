The film is not credible in helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, no woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. The only part of the movie you could believe in was that Germany wanted to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British have captured all the spies, but even if they had not, they would not have let one run around just to reassure the Germans that the landing would take place in Calais. It's not an important thing that does not make the movie work. It's the culmination of all the wrong things that make the movie a failure. Bad direction, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity at all, just drop the movie. In general, spies should invade the woodwork. The spy comes into play with the spy and wonders if the information he has is valid or not and worries about being discovered. In this case, this game was over from the start. This spy did everything but spy. Your only chance of getting something that has credibility and creates some tension may be reading the book.
