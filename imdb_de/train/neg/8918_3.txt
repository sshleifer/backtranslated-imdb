... fortunately he does not have it yet! This is a rough, simplified student policy that becomes a drama. The viewer has to get used to a series of illusions. Conceit 1: That a British Electorate could be moved from a substantially right center to the overwhelming left. Conceit 2: That all media and public debates are unanimous and that the only critics of the new PM are creepy officials, MI5, big business and the Americans (of course). Concept 3: That this radical socialist prime minister can easily solve all trade union, economic and social problems in a way that unites the nation. Concept 4: It's a good thing to break all links with the US and NATO. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had tighter times in the 80s. And finally, Conceit 6: That the US reactionary forces would actively seek a coup against the UK. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous and the show only got the reputation it could make through the money in an anti-Thatcher sentiment in the country and abandoned TV critics singing its praises. Television was still a very popular and influential medium with shows that received great reviews, so a much-discussed drama with a touch of controversy had a good chance of reaching a large audience. The performance of Ray McInally was great, which is one of the few pluses. History and time have shown that the premise and plot of this show are very big.
