I can not remember a movie where I did not care less about where the characters came from, what happened to them or where to go. I realize that Hollywood's biggest pastime is the navel gaze, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take their time. However, the discussion following the show under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series allowed the three women to show redeeming qualities. I do not agree with you.
