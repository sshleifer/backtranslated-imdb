Two films are useful to scare people away from God, this and the "Event Horizon". One has a significant and moving message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can be. Too bad that Paul Anderson has gone to the cursed Resident Evil movies, he was really up to something. <br /> <br /> Thief at night is hampered by many obvious independent movie attributes (drama, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it's obvious what the intention of the movie is from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the mistakes of this film. So we stick to The Omega Code, Left Behind and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they care so much about selling their message, "Save you, people!" that everything else comes second, when the audience is hit over the head with a Bible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not believe that I even write so much about a movie that is so ineffective. Skip it completely and go back to Sam Neil, who has dug up his eyeballs. 1 out of 5.
