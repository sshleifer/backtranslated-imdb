There is a reason why Jay Leno does not recognize this film. It is consistently considered one of the worst films of all time. The acting is awful, the script lacks the direction, and the director does not seem to be sure how to record this movie. "A buddy movie", "an action / comedy", "a mystery". Seems half way, he gives up and is just there. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It's a shame they wereted their time and presents to make this mess out of a movie. Before Jay Leno and Pat Morita dealt with it, they had spent years doing their craft at the Hollywood Circuit. Mr. Morita was already a real star and acted as the star of the cult classics like "Happy Days" and the gloomy, but sympathetic "Mr. T and Tina" since the mid-1960s. And he won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful movie "Midway", "The Karate Kid" and many more. Mr. Leno is seen in TV shows in the mid-1970s. And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America. He is seen in countless TV spots and in major films. It's a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
