Vulpine Massacre should be the actual title of this movie. The line should read "Guaranteed to make your kids scream!" This is a nature drama that tells the story of a wild fox family in a remote area. Starting with the meeting and mating of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the attempts to raise them. The only speech in the story is held by a tree that stands over the cave and gives an insight into the love and life of the animals ... Beautiful scenery and wonderful filming of the animals. Sounds good, right? Well, from there on it goes straight to hell and then we drill towards the core ... <br /> <br /> *** spoiler down - Or they could be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost immediately we learn that one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems to be well enough and there is a wonderfully happy music that accompanies him ... And then he dies ... Next we have one of the sibling adventures. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets her on-screen time ... and then she dies ... And so it's like a horrible Slasher movie, when one fox after another is naturally killed in traps up and down and even from a bunch of snowmobiles! At the end of the film, almost all foxes have been massacred. Although mercifully no deaths are displayed on the screen. (At least not in the version we saw.) Unlike "Tarka the Otter," the deaths in this film are almost useless and bordering on the sadistic, how hopes are built up and then faded out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It is after all a nature film. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to this movie that is deceived by the merry box to think it's safe for the kids. Watch it with some foresight that things * will * not * go well and that you or your children may feel very bad depending on how sensitive you or they are. You can enjoy it. Or you can not ...
