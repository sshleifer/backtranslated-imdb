The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this film received the praise he has received. Al Gore is certainly a pretty actor. He sounds so worried. But actions speak more than words! Throughout the film, there are political tidbits and references to his political career, which is sprayed throughout the film. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks but also walks. When Carter said we needed to save energy, he turned off the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a pullover. Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and claim that we are creating global warming while traveling in his own private jet. How much energy does the jet use and how much more pollution does it generate? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's pool behind his villa? It would be nice if we could save power by using smaller devices and turning off everything that is not needed. In this case, the energy company would respond to a 50% reduction in energy by talking about a "50% loss of revenue" and offset the losses by increasing tax rates by 50%. "Simply switch off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled appeal that allows big goivernment to control everything, in the name of saving the earth.
