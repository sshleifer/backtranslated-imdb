Okay, I wrote a scathing review because the movie is awful. As I waited for another review (for Derrida), I decided to read the old reviews of this horrible movie. Take a look at all the positive reviews. They ALL, I say, ALL that come from contributors have not rated any movie other than this one. Crimminy! and wait until the "Rosebud" [sic] Review. <br /> <br /> Review the other films that Rosebud has reviewed and made glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot !, they happen to be the only other films by the two writers and directors. Holy Window Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you son of a bitch, and Tony, you could not get out of a bad script. No jobs for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED FILM!
