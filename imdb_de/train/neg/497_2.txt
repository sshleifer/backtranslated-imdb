This is a really stupid movie. It could be fun with the cool-looking aliens and the rural environment, but it's just not possible. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the transmission of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it for Halloween. They come to earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and look stupid. The cover of the movie shows these aliens riding on surfboards in space ... not really what they are doing. These are not party aliens, they are silly cartoonish idiots with annoying high modulated voices. The most alien in the most tolerable voice is the Jack Nicholson rip-off alien, who always wears his sunglasses. Apart from the aliens, action is awful. Writing is obviously meant for children, as every character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie that maybe only kids appreciate. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 min. PG for mild language.
