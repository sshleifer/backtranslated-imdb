You probably heard this sentence when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: full of crap" and yes, it's true. This movie is really awful and totally lame. <br /> <br /> This was the second worst movie Lindsey has been in since the Teenage Drama Queen's confession. The only good thing about this film seems to be the over-talent cast, which is far better than the movie millionfold and the only selling point of the film. I do not see how such a distinguished actor as Matt Dillon could be part of this film. Did not he read this horrible script before signing up? <br /> <br /> What I disliked about this movie is also how Herbie is surreal and imaginative, and has extraordinary abilities and climbs up the wall and drives faster than a racing car, even though it's just a Beatle. I know it's a children's movie, but they've gone overboard with it and it's just more silly than entertaining. Little realism is needed and the story is too predictable. In conclusion: If the kids are not really 5-12 years old, I strongly doubt anyone can enjoy this pointless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel like cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
