National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and saucy cola - head days of the seventies (when the comedy with lots of naked babes was amplified) depends very much on your date of birth, but everyone agrees By the early 1980s, middle age had killed off any residual sparks of anarchic humor that the drugs did not have, and offerings like this movie and the increasingly terrifying spin-off plates shot more holes in the hull. Apart from a beautifully illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend to recommend this uniquely depressing Stinkbug. If you make it through the amazing opening segment "Growing Myself", you hope things get better, and that's bad luck. Whoever had thought that a woman was brutally raped with a butter stick was a comedy that deserved her head to be returned to him on a plate of dog waste. If there is ever a worldwide shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this far-flung, incoherent rumble of sullen ideas and heavy performances can serve a purpose.
