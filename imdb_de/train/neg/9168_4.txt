Randolph Scott leaves the US for the greener pastures of Canada in British Columbia. There he wants to found a cattle farm with his partner Bill Williams and Lee Tung Foo. They stomped their small herd over a tollbooth built by Victor Jory. Later, Jory rushes his cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the Fracas. From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a number of good Western Westerns for adults, some of which were considered true classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo Trail will never count among his best westerns. <br /> <br /> It's rather the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. The story is sometimes stupid. Williams, who was traveling with Scott, wanted to go for gold, because there was a big strike back then. He does not blame the racers, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the film where Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They flee because Gabby's mule has been ordered to take command, and he kills the Indians so that our heroes can flee. I'm not sure if that would have been in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, history also suggests that you believe Tyro Prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles upon a gold strike after spending just a few hours learning from prospector Gabby Hayes how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was Gabby Hayes' farewell movie. It would have been better if he had gone into a good western and in fact he had done some better with Randolph Scott before. I'll say that, even though Caribou was not present. The film is one of the few Canadian local films from the past that did NOT have Mounties. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour via the Cariboo Trail.
