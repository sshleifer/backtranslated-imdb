I saw the 22 o'clock. show and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not want to leave the theater because I did not have time for it (since I do not actually pay for movies anymore), I actually found no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of lines and those that were made I'm poised, but the movie seemed mostly male from a rampant fan service for younger (older than age, as this movie is rated as R) To be an audience. The fan service seemed inappropriate and quite distracting. I know you all want to tell Samuel L., as he says his infamous line, but let's face it, it's a lot of hype for very little pay. The only really horrible part of the movie was the CG, which looked very digital and did not work well with the live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a sensible man, I knew that I could go to the theater that I would not see "Casablanka", and at least I'm grateful that this movie is an original one (albiet inane) idea is not about any re-make or franchise spinoff. But to be honest, if you're not part of the cult, it's probably better to spend your money elsewhere and either watch the movie in a second theater in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
