Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but that was really bad. The kind of bad you wish you could get that time back in your life, the kind of bad thing that makes you think, "What on earth did you want to film that at all," the kind of bad thing you wanted They still had 50 minutes to go to the kitchen to grab a snack during the movie. The kind of leprosy that makes leprosy look, the way you think you would have preferred to rent a Pauly Shore movie ... Unfortunately, I can not explain how bad that was. <br /> <br /> After saying that ... there were a few amusing laughs, but they are all LESS than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and funny, but the entire subplot that Anchorman did not consider was really left out for good reason ... it was not even a little good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or a favor in the US), and do not look at this DVD ... this will affect the good movie that is Anchorman and you do not want that , <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
