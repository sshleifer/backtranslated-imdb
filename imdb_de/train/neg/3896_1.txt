Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule commenting, "They did not live until you saw the sun through the rings of Saturn," while the obvious midday light streamed in through the window when he suddenly showed up with a bleeding nose. Next, West is back in a secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that goes insane and runs a chunky nurse through a false glass door. Obviously, West becomes "stronger when it melts," which makes so much sense in everything else in this hopelessly purist, noble intellectual film. Then this dumb "Army Brass," who somehow looks like Coleman Francis (director of many evil moovies) tries to cover up the information, but Goo Man runs around killing everyone he sees as he melts. He attacks an old couple because it melts. He makes a terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because he melts. It melts because it melts. The movie of the slumbering Rick Baker is said to be the star here, but they just look hokey. The film is filmed badly and everything seems so dark and confused it's very hard to figure out what's what - not that it would help everyone. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this one ?? : = 8P ps - "Did not get any crackers?"
