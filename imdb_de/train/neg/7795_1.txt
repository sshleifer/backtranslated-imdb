First, I'm not really a fan of the whole movie genre of "things that eat meat in disgusting new ways," but I'm a bad movie lover. That's why my neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This. So we start to see it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder without a tripod! Second, the voice of the thin white doctor is dubbed by a big black man! Third, no dialogue makes sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and with poor make-up and tomato paste, make me believe that the director (and my neighbor next door) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes, but it's getting old fast. It's so amateurish, it's like seeing a badly named yearbook of high school zombies. A note to anyone involved with this movie - I'd like to go back to the 20 minutes of my life I've looked at before falling asleep.
