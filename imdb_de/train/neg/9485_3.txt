Since others have taken the trouble to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points to this film. There may be spoilers here; I'm not interested enough to filter them out. <br /> <br /> - Given the film's low budget, the creature design was pretty good. It's really nice to see a direct-to-video horror movie that's not smeared with terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital films is quite grainy in some places and most noticeable in the well-lit white corridors of asylum Over time. I understand that the director may have tried to simulate dementia, but to achieve this, a consistent flow of time had to be created. As it is, it just seems amateurish. <br /> <br /> - Plot turns were numerous, but consistently predictable. I had no doubt about the identity of the dressed-up cultists or the fact that in the end a lame evil-trumps-good-development would emerge. <br /> <br /> - That may seem like that, but the characters in this movie do not use common sense reliably. First of all, there are regulatory commissions in a psychiatric center where all deaths of patients and workers have been unilaterally termed cardiac arrest. Why should the chief psychiatrist be able to perform autopsies? Why was no plot made of these impressive qualifications or his introduction to his strange choice of religion? What is the background? What should interest us in this case for someone? And equally important: who would go through the introduction to the place, see all that was so terribly wrong, and then come to the conclusion that it is still a good place for a residence? This movie did not even respect its characters enough to use their intelligence in doubt. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: See The Wicker Man instead.
