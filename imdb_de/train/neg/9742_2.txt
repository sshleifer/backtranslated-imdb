This is a pretty boring movie about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and is horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself. Simple plot that was previously made in fly and other. He is not only disfigured, he can also electrocute people with a touch. What's really stupid about this movie is that we should believe that the place this guy works is against him. He could probably make millions for the institution he works at, but the institution's leader is trying to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. In the end, the projected man kills three people for no reason, then he follows those who have wronged him.
