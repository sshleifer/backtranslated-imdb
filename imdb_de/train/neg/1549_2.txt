While Leon is nice to SNL, he is only active for a minute. Like most SNL sketch-to-movies, this one can not last 90 minutes. There are some nice moments (which you saw in the trailer), but the actors are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have many highlights. Will Farrell has a small part. Farrell is perhaps the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. Too bad.
