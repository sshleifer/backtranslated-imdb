The 1998 co-starring Michael Keaton-Kiddie comedy has been flatly condemned for its miserable special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked for this horror comedy, they are absolutely stunning. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. What they were probably. The cast sets it in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) films and Paul Keith as a city doctor is memorable especially in a small but funny role.
