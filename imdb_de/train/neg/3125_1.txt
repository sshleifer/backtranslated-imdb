Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives with some servants in Morhenge Mansion and tells his friend the doctor, "Do not try to treat me, Doctor! I am disgustingly healthy!" He invites his nieces and nephews to their homes and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by causing the brain to shrink (?). <br /> Morteval / Karloff dies, and murderous " Toys "(designed by his dead brother) begin to kill the relatives. A mini-cannon shoots real bullets into a guy's face, a life-size knight in armor attacks with an ax, and a dancing sheik stabbing people with a knife. A guy being strangled makes some weird faces. In the end, Julissa and her friend Karloff still live and hide in the dungeon, where steel doors close the room. He plays the recurring organ theme music (a kind of death rattle used for the killings), the brother's mind starts to talk ("The whole house will go with me!") And the villa goes up in flames This pointless mess is too dark , boring and the stupid dialogue never goes to the lips.
