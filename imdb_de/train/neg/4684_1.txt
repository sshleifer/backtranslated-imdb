This movie is an insult to ALL submariners. It was stupid. It seemed to have been written by monkeys. Acting was absurd. If this is the view of most people from the navy, then I cry for our defense. This movie was awful. I have shown it under "Journey to the Seabed" as far as submarine movies. Gene Hackman must have needed rental money for this crap. Denzel Washington must have been high. Little in the plot makes sense. And the end. That a mutineer be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you have not found out yet, I did not like it. And if not all pro-comments, I would not have bothered to post.
