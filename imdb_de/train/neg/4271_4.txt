A typical thriller has been done many times. Simple plot contour; Policeman Liotta is obsessed with Russell's wife and tries to shake off good old Kurt so he can have her. This is unpredictable, it does not even try to guess you, the plot is the plot and there is no thinking here. I think the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing original or interesting is done. There is not really anything to say about this movie, it is not too bad, but there are no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you get when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying, Cher-like voice. I read the story and could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I looked at it and it rolled in front of my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I did not consistently feel a drop of emotion. I have no feeling about this movie as if I had never seen it. Considering that, it's a pretty pointless movie, right? Nevertheless, for some reason I give 3/10.
