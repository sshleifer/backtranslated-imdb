I did not know that this was a silent movie with narrative. I'm not interested in silent films - the insane humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure that's attributed to the low score I've assigned to him. It was about chapter 8 before I was interested in the story, and if I had popcorn I might have thrown it on the screen. Maybe that appeals to the science-fiction audience? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I was with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rosselinni has told this film - which is a pleasing aspect of the film. No one commented on how much they enjoyed it, and he did not appreciate the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
