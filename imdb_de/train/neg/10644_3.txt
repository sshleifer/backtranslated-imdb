Well, here we have another roll change film. There were many things worth seeing, despite the tired conspiracy of the sexes. This is not the case. I believe in earlier reviews I commented on the general decline in the enjoyment of Haim films after the late 1980s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just One of the Girls' is a high school boy (Corey Haim) who tries to avoid his bullying by dressing up as a girl and visiting another school , He joins the cheerleading team and befriends his cheerleader Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not keep up with the Charade for too long. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be totally shitty and not even funny. But after a majority of the reviews, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who want to see that. If you are looking for a good Haim feature (or a role reversal comedy), you are no further than 1989. This is where Haim's career came from.
