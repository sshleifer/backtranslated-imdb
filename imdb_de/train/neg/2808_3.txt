A cast of 1980s TV movies and television series (including Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel and others) in the story of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, the models and other people start to be dead, which leads to all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> Beyond the not very good thriller, he has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating, but not enough good material to really generate something interest. This is best described as the type of film that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name Skinamax. I really can not understand it when you see this, if you do not have to see every seedy thriller out there. (I must also say that this movie is filled with smoking, so it gets ridiculous when someone lights up.)
