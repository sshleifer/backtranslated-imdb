This is a classic stinker with a large cast, mostly with seniors, who in this case have not had much to do in a long time. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty depressing movie to think about. Stay on earth and you will be confronted with illness and possibly your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she was still dancing. Too bad the movie did not focus on it anymore. Looking desperate, Maureen Stapleton still showed those steps of "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom" to commit so much down to earth ten years ago mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones. How can someone be idiotic enough to like that and say that it makes you think? Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? If the seniors did this? A wonderful thing in the end, why was the youngster encouraged to leave the boat? Why is Steve Guttenberg jump ship too? After all, he had found his love. <br /> <br /> This would have been a nice movie if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, except Wilford Brimley, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn, and Lord know who else has gone. The scriptwriters should have included the script in this group.
