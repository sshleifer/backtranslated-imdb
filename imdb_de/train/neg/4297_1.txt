I suddenly wake up as I realize that I'm drooling on the plastic couch cover, and realize that it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all muscle relaxers my grandma? Could it be an onset narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I briefly stopped on Cheap Seats during the channel surfing, and the overwhelming lack of humor and talent exhausted my life force at such a speed that I failed. <br /> <br /> It's shaking his head, mouth open, shrugging. But I have to give these stupid and boring twins recognition that I could sell that idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programmer they had with me, and when he / she woke up, there were already some horrible episodes in the can, and he hoped no one was sleeping, as all viewers would be sleeping it can be awful and he / she can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
