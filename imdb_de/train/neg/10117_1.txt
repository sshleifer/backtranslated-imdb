Impressive. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B horror movie and found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought that it was just the movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the B horror movie I was thinking of. That was a lot worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I did not know that such shit existed among the people. This film seemed to have written and directed like a 5 year old movie. That's nice. I'm an up and coming director and this movie has made me so crazy that someone out there paid this guy direct movies. He has to work at a dump where he belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this. I will tell you the same thing that I would say to someone who is preparing to commit suicide. "Do not do it, it's not worth it!" I really have nothing good to say about this movie. DO NOT DO IT!
