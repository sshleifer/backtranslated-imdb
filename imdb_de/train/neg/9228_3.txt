CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a David Mamet fan. The film tells the story of a young filmmaker making a very barbarous film. After that, the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" in CQ has the problem of having no end. This is very similar to the CQ, which (in my opinion) also lacks an end. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see this movie at the SxSW Film Festival. I had pretty high expectations when I just saw Y Tu Mama Tambien and some other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. It was not a simple movie to get in. If you're not interested in sci-fi movies of the '60s or slow movies that do not go there, skip it. If you want to rent a recent sci-fi-like indie movie rental Donnie Darko, you will not go to sleep.
