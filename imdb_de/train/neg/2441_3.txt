I found "Intensive Care" pretty bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it could be. Sometimes it's exciting, but never a good shocker. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The fun is in ridiculous moments. The classic classic of all time is the following: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the murderer. He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks: "Poor Peter, should I give you a band aid?". <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. To save costs, all of the plates are USA and the background in the news studio is a Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and see the original version in Dutch.
