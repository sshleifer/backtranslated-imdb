I've watched this movie for two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about. Someone was murdered or maybe not, and maybe someone did it or maybe not. This brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) Back when all Canadian movies by CBC Stinker were. Stinkers have been the exception lately, but this confused mix of trendy feminism, stunning flashbacks, and mumbled dialogues makes up for the lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues this beautiful Canadian tradition. It is not easy to see. Maybe the trendy people at the Chi Chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they like it. We folks in the Boonies are a little less presumptuous.
