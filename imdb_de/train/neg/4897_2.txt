This film is for me the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang. It exudes laziness from every frame. I will not analyze it thoroughly. But some remarks: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is dryness, why do we then see urban landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that should mean anything in the metaphorical context of the movie (in the thirst for intimacy and watermelon the insignificant replacement sex). Or it's just a matter of lousy filmmaking without worrying about being coherent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or probably dead. It seems to be a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is delivered successfully (= bombastic), but in retrospect, her sluggish body turns out to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, an excuse. as free and exploitative as the activity in which it is used. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing in this film expresses what Antonioni did not say better 40 years ago? and without unnecessarily humiliating his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like the idea of ​​an artistic counterpoint to a secondary school student running at this level of secondary school. If that was the point, the point sucked.
