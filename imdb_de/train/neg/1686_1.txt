Imagine being asked for your date, which movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a pretty interesting trailer about "The Grudge". In good faith, it is therefore advisable to watch this movie. After all, it's the Halloween season. And it cracked at the box office last weekend, so it must be pretty good ... so go there. and you hear yourself say audibly, "This can not be the end of the movie ..." But unfortunately that's it. <br /> <br /> And imagine, it would be embarrassing and embarrassed when you leave the movie Cinema come because you have recommended such a dog for a movie. You think your date is going to make you foolish, if you suggest such cruelty, and your proposal will certainly end a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that we both collapsed and laughed at how bad it was. I do not see any future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and I suggest she stay with TV in the future. In fact, it will not be long before she sells flea market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The action made no sense; Continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the entire end was provided with a "Grudge II - The Return of Cat Boy".
