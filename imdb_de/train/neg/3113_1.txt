This movie is a mess. I am surprised that there is even a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams it would have gone straight to the video. It is badly written. It is badly directed. It's a worse offensive that it has taken an interesting topic and made it a ridiculous and boring thriller that has neither thrill nor tension and no internal or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film fits into a series of ridiculous set pieces. This is so exaggerated that the audience with whom I saw it laughed about it. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it's not exciting and there's no thrill - the movie's really worst offense is that it's just boring.
