I'm a GIANT Adam Sandler fan and one day I watched the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and saw "Going Overboard". So I went out with a few buddies and rented it. We put it on and were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who had not yet hit puberty. He looked like he was 12 when this movie came out. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this bitch, I did not laugh, laugh or just smile at this movie. Actually, I was the only time I grinned when I saw how awful this movie was. I could not believe how much he had tried to make the audience laugh in this movie ... and it did not even work. Even though I saw the awful terrible camera angles and heard the horrible screenplay, I realized why I had never heard of this movie ... because he shits more than anything that has ever sucked before. This movie was, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made, .... ever!
