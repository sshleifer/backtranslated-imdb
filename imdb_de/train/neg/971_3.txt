After reading some very good reviews about this movie, I thought I would see it and after I was very disappointed I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first who is so unpopular with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'd cut the horror out of the genre, as it's not terrible or scary at all (except for a few weak attempts), let's jump one that worked for me.) I'd say that it's a thriller to call this movie because I'm not too excited! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. During this time, she visits a house that she has drawn. After each visit, she decides to add something else to the house to make it more alive. This is a sad little boy who is actually sick too. As she makes friends with the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world that created her is actually better than the real world she is in. By the time she brings her ever-living father home, it turns out that her father proves to be bad and bad and the boy has to flee from his clutches. <br /> <br /> I think it's an attempt to be a slightly gentler version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but rather a ride to the beach. <br /> <br /> Finally, my generous 3/10 will hopefully keep one of you from looking at this seedy body!
