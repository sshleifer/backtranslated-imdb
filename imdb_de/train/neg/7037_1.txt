This is really a horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is both bland and offensive, with nudity and a lot of violence. The nudity is not so exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring. In addition, the plot is weak at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie should be funny, but not. I did not even laugh when I saw it, and I did not even give up a smile. The creators of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and failed on both counts. <br /> <br /> Some bad movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
