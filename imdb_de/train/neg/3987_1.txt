I only left very few films before the end, but I could not finish this piece of garbage. This was the biggest burden of racism that has been trying to make legitimate film since Birth of a Nation. The characters were little more than cardboard boxes. I do not see how an actor wants to associate his name with this movie. Lee has better things to do to sort out the garbage. I know that I and everyone who has a brain has something better to do. I wish someone would make a film about intercultural relations that dealt realistically with the subject. This theme has a lot more depth, the soft cries of a bitter director like Lee.
