I'm 13 and I hated this movie. It is the worst movie in the world. I wasted my time and was disappointed because it looks pretty good on the cover and back of the movie, but I was wrong. But when I saw Delta, she was totally different and a bad actress. I really did not know how old the two girls wanted to be and I was so confused. The movie was partly confusing and I did not enjoy it at all, but I just watched the movie to see if it would get any better, but it was not boring, boring and I said BORING.and I do not think so that many other people liked it as much as I did. boring boring
