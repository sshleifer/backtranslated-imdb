The most striking feature of this semi-musical backdrop in Berlin Berlin of the 1920s is the wonderful cinematography and the cut. In these departments, First National is First National. The story is easily captivating and resembles the actions of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY), in which the working girl romances from a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and the final clinch. All four musical numbers are bundled at the beginning of the film and we make a long distance without further musical uplift. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and repeats BECAUSE YOU. There is also NO BLUE and THAT YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST. Miller is very appealing and adorable and reminds of Irene Dunne in fashion and delivery. She does not dance sadly because that's her strength. SALLY remains her best movie, with this second and the rather poor SUNNY a far inferior runner. Her life was tragically disrupted by a sinusitis before the days when hospitals and antibiotics prevented such tragedies. However, it is worth visiting these films to see Ziegfeld's top star of the twenties.
