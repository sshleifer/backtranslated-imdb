We've all seen some infinite epics in our time, but this one surpasses them all! The movie is so long and so slow that I felt much older on entering the movie hall than I entered it. With a duration of almost 4 hours, it could have been made into a tele-series. What begins as a promising comedy is slowly losing its pace. Nikhil Advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he can not cope with any of them ... First of all, there is no connection between them, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes only seem to be forced to link the story together. <br /> <br /> The situation is exacerbated by silly dialogues (most of them will be repeated in Hindi cinema over the years) and stupid cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not know that she really needs to play her role instead of just seeing glamor on the screen ... a total waste of beauty with no theatrical abilities. <br /> <br /> And then there are loud, funny Govinda & my-face-turns-better than Jim - Carrey Akshay Khanna, who burps out of her lungs again and again to irritate already tired spectators. <br /> <br /> Only a good part of the film is John & Vidya's love story & nice acting / comedy by Sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two couples could have justified the film without confusing it with other piles of characters. Their brilliance is lost in the middle of other below-average plotlines. <br /> <br /> My guess - the director made two separate films (maybe more!) and a beginner assistant mixed all the records over a point They made the selection so the director did not have a choice, all as one single movie ... <br /> <br /> Just look at it, if you want to test your patience !!!
