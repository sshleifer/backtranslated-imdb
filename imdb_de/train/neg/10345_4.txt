In 1941, Columbia was a full-fledged studio and could produce a film with the same technical brilliance as MGM, Paramount or Warner. That's the best thing to say about "Adam Had Four Sons," a lead-free soap opera with almost endless threadbare performances by Ingrid Bergman (first billed for the first time in an American movie) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (at that time Hollywood felt that one foreign accent was as good as another). He was hired as the governess of Baxter's Four Sons and remained (with a break caused by the stock market crash of 1907) until the boys are adult men serving in World War I. Almost everyone in the movie is so benign - well, it's a relief when Susan Hayward steps in the middle. She is the only observable person in the film, though she clearly channeled Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh. is it also the first in their long sequence of alcoholic roles? but the script stays sugary and the end is completely absurd. No wonder Bergman rejected the equally plotted "The Valley of Decision" four years later.
