"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing it could have done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It all started again. Sure, this "last" movie in the saga is stupid, but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even something breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zane), who returns to the city to face her evil father, is unique. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is nothing more than another cartoon that brings kids to the theater. There are a number of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and walk around like sheep ready to kill. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end, it's nothing but silly, childlike entertainment. <br /> <br />
