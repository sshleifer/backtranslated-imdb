I would not rate this movie, it is not worthy. I just looked at it because I'm Pfieffer fan. I love her and would see everything she did. Even in this guy she did not disappoint. Every scene she was in made the viewer watch, wait for something, but did nothing. It had some good storylines, but they ended abruptly as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing came of it. <br /> <br/> Pfieffer was 29 when she filmed this movie and at her finest. The wardrobe and the set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can usually watch everything and rarely come across a movie I can not find, but it was a jerk. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all was that there was a big cliffside at the end. There was a closing scene that woke you up and said, wow, this movie is finally going to go somewhere, then the credits are playing. Good grief <br /> <br /> I agree with the review, which states that .99 had bought 3 cans of cat food and it would be observable if my cat ate. Well said. Actually, this comment was more entertaining than the movie because it summarized it so well. I also wasted 0.99 cents for this Dud.dud.dud.
