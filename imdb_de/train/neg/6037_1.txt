Moron and girlfriend perform a ritual to revive the dead to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they resurrect a dead soul that starts hacking them with an ax, and the next day some college-age people tell the story by the campfire. The guy with the ax turns up and starts hacking the idiots who tell the story. The group calls the police, the policeman sees blood spurting everywhere, and believes that it is a mountain lion (!?), And is soon hunted by a deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. Moronic a small splatter movie shot in broad daylight where several people carry flashlights and talk as if it's the middle of the night and they want to send a signal flare to attract attention. A man has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other, but he has no trouble loading the gun, and after he has finally loaded it, he has several options to shoot the killer, but does not bother because this would finish the movie too soon. Then he throws the gun away! Also disadvantageous are characters who show no emotion and are not badly affected after their friends have been torn to pieces and have lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken that in the end inflated car was clearly a model car) and terrible dialogue and something really ugly female nudity does not help. And in the end, she tries to get away with her incoherence by saying that it was the invention of the same college people who told campfire stories at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer turns up in the last scene and chops her to pieces. Mediocre of its kind, good only for a few unintentional laughs. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
