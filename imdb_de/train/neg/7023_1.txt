OK, my girlfriend and I hired the DVD and after about 30 minutes in the movie we exchanged a lot. Either we needed drugs to interest us in the "conspiracy", or just to end the pain right there and then do something else observe. We opted for the latter. <br /> <br /> I really liked "But I'm a Cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer D.E.B.S, Better Than Chocolate, Fucking Åmål, Goldfish Memory, and Fire. <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
