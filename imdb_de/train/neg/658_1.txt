I wish I could give this movie a zero of ten. Before I went to this movie one day after the show, I came to IMDb to review the comments. One comment called the film predictable and cheesy with terrible dialogues. I never go after other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars on this crap movie. It had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be hit by a cliff. Since when do horror films have juicy scenes? I swear, I am amazed that there were no moments of the group. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I quit and thought about my research for English. The clich√©, birds / cat that emerge from nowhere, considering something would happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were stupid. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I have to get my mother's scarf !!!" You. Fool. Screw the scarf! Safety is only a few steps away, but NO, my mother's cloth (which, by the way, did not fit the dress) is more important to WAYYYY than my health and safety. And to top it off, bring her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the WHOLE movie. And not only that, I bet he hides moments. It was that, "He stole the clothes of the hotel armor and sneaked out of the hotel" and "It's the detective who comes down the hall, not the killer!" Moments Movies should not be predictable. Disney movies are not even that predictable. <br /> <br /> I will now finish my saying and say this was a horrible movie. I'm glad I saw it in the cinemas, so I would not buy it for $ 15 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If the murderer, after being shot by the detective, would have fallen in the same position in which he was shot. Knife in hand, the girl fell and stabbed down. Oh, how nice that would have been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Watch a good movie.
