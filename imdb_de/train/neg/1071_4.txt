A very weak movie, mainly because of a bad story, but also in the case of Robert Downey Jr. bad behavior and irrational behavior of many characters. If you like to switch off your mind and just watch a movie because of its creativity or its acting criteria, then you like this movie. Personally, I can not do that with a drama and found that too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when a protagonist, who should actually be a smart person, behaves constantly as a whole Infertile. If in this film the main character acts as a person normally acts in these situations, there would be no film. <br /> <br /> The first highly unlikely act is when the main character of a successful lawyer named Magruder is played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves a party and meets a girl, Mallory Doss, played by Embeth Davidtz, who screams that her car was stolen. They are in a tropical rainstorm when he gets them to take a ride home. She tells him about her strange father, who belongs to a strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive in their dilapidated cabin in the poorer part of the city, they notice that their car is in the driveway. The house lighting is on and some items in the house were broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, she is weird (she looks like a tramp, undresses in front of him until she is completely naked.) Oh yes!). Even the father is strange, the house is a wreck - everything should have said to Magruder: "Hey, that's too weird for me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, picks up the case that she's trying to commit her father and everything screams as if that's all! <br /> <br /> Then it would be high up - aviation lawyer that he is, he arrives late in the office and wears the same shirt as the night before (a fact that all women in the office notice). Is it likely that a successful lawyer behaves like a 16? -Year-old? Magruder has angered the police in some of his cases, and when he goes to the police and claims with sufficient evidence that his father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him. I could have believed help believed, but no help at all - unlikely! <br /> <br /> It's just too unlikely.
