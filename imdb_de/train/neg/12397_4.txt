I've read somewhere where this movie was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film Noir, Criss Cross. I found the latter disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir" because it is modern and in color, two things purists would disqualify for the movie Noir status. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback was not the cinematography (that was fine), but the confused plot. Hey, some of the 1940s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar, but I did not care about some of them. The filmmakers did not help the situation by adding flashbacks to the story every three minutes. No wonder this story goes on. It was ridiculous! What happens is that there is so much confusion at the 45-minute mark that nobody cares anymore. I dont know.
