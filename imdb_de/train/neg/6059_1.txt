I have to say that he is a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I can not think logically that he was trying as hard as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it does not look like a movie. It looked like someone else was ordering it for a cause. I can not believe Carpenter even tried. <br /> <br /> I just heard his old H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was fantastic, especially for the time. > <br /> He used a style that nobody had and that worked so well for his films.
