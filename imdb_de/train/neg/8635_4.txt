This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulci's better flicks. The conspiracy is pretty bad, a millionaire is murdered and his spirt asks his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with it (except to know who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was the question of why anyone should take care of it. The Father is a really big jerk (including the daughter he asks for help) for anyone he met, making it difficult for anyone to care who killed him. But nobody really looks at a Fulci movie for a good plot. If you did, it would be like watching porn for incredible screenwriting and acting. As a rule, his films try to compensate for this by adding too many scenes from Gore, but even that is missing in this film. If you're looking for a good Fulci movie, check out The Beyond.
