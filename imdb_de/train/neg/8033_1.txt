In a dorm, a man is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, she's on her way, with a new friend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence), and is currently spending Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a large, beautiful Florida apartment. Of course, the killer turns up (for no reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> Lousy Slasher Thriller - a textbook example of how NOT to make a low budget horror movie. For starters, large parts of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots who film themselves, "have fun" (more fun than the audience), get drunk, look stupid, etc. Plus, there's NO nudity here. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but ALL to liven it up would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are just a bit bloody and there is no bleeding. There is a REAL cruelty - but that is not until the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, acting is shitty. Dorie Barton is terrible as head woman and Tom Jay Jones is as Oz lousy. Chad Allen turns up as Brad and he is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is really good - handsome and hunky and gives everything to this crap. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role that does a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Logic sinks abound - after realizing that a friend was killed, two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's reaction to the death of a friend is kind of weird and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears in the end without a trace! Stupid, stupid, no blood, no nudity - skip that
