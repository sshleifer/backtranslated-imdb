To see The Tenants was an interesting experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen where I've moved through parts of the (non-) action at tremendous speed - and I can usually watch everything from action movies to Serbo-Croatian indies and find them fascinating , <br /> <br /> The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and overly orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is that there are few realistic character dialogues, apart from the standards where characters "collide" in a very structured framework (to make this work, the film had to be more conceptual, which he did not). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; Everyone seems to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very inappropriate. At one point, I even stopped the movie because the aggressive, violent and monotone delivery of the character has upset me so much, the lack of any other personality layer except the reactionary "turn-on" (which becomes really predictable after some time). and I desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. One reason for this vessel, however, could be the nebulous time landscape of the film (supposedly '70s, it feels and looks more like early offspring). If it had been more securely fixed in the 1970s, his character would have been more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also uncomfortable. Throughout the passage, the soundtrack tries to create a rough, jazzy atmosphere that simply has not stopped, mainly because the set was too well lit. <br /> <br /> The Tenants is such an amazing movie for me. It does not represent real people and does not suggest interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, whether they are white or black. Oddly enough, I felt that this project was so needed David Lynch; His sinister, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have turned both the actors and the script into something very remarkable.
