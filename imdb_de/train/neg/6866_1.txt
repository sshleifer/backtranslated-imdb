This film has so few lessons compared to strangers on a train or even "accidental meeting" that, despite the similarities with the plans, I do not feel right when compared to one of them. The Yancy Butler character looked like a stupid fool I was too embarrassed for the author and director to continue watching. <br /> <br /> I do not like a lot of Lifetime Movies, but I feel compelled to watch a movie from time to time for the sake of promoting harmony at home. I often moan softly, but this movie made me protest aloud, get up, leave the room and mumble in front of me before returning to my favorite chair to be tortured. <br /> <br / Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
