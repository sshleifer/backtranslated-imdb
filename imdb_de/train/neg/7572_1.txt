It felt like I had seen this movie a thousand times already. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story twisted a bit, every time I expected something interesting, I saw nothing but what I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another plant because there was not enough bread". In two words: flat story that has become a clich√©, bad drama, bad special effects ... Only the dumb Russian policeman Vlad was a bit funny when he punished the bad guys. The muscle pile was so incredibly stupid. that it made me laugh for a moment. I wonder why I wasted my time spitting on the shame of a movie ... It will not get any worse (because it's not possible): D
