I was very dissatisfied with this step. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was effortless, the action exaggerated, the songs not melodious. Even the story was weightless. I had high expectations of a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom. The actors worked too hard and did not help the movie at all. Of course, Kareena rocked for two seconds in a bikini. I think Hindi stunt directors should find out how action movies are made. They tend to exaggerate far too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because it's the hallmark. But the signature of Hindi cinema are the songs. A good action movie should not take more than two hours and can not look unrealistic. However, I am sure that these action films will be much sharper in the future. Please also note: comedy and action movies do not mix if they are not working properly. Good luck for next time.
