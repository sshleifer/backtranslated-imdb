I do not know what this other guy thought. The fact that this film was made independent does not make him less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you like ... The majority of this film is mindless. I feel offended because I had to watch the first 40 minutes. And that alone was no small matter. The acting is not only terrible, the action is never close. There are countless holes in history, to the point where they can hardly be called history anymore. I've never read the book before, so I can not criticize this, but this is the first review I've written here, and it's all about saving all your viewers out there. I can not remember the last time I saw a movie. This one really takes the cake.
