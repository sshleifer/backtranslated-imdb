This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was cruel and the drama hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a homework project at a film school, but it certainly sounded like one. It is not even particularly successful in its central notion of wanting to appear as a single continuous recording. The whooshing horizontal scanners are a cheap and unoriginal way to hide cuts.
