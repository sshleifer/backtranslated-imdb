This might have been a pretty entertaining movie, but instead he ranks with other guys like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. If they had played this stroke of tongues, it could have been a very entertaining movie, like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays him in places more on the mouth, but more often. <br /> <br /> The premise of this movie is a small community besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned garbage dump near a sewer that mutates the slugs into aggressive, carnivorous monsters - though monsters can move slowly and be squashed under their boots. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only ones willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor deem them crazy. The highlight is a laughing uprising - inadvertently - scratching your head on how stupid (actor and scriptwriter) the scenario of snail destruction is. STORY: $$ (There's no new ground here: Simon seems to play the Gore elements ironically, but the dialogue is straight.) Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with many one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLINCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed.) There are many exploding scenes in the chest cavity as well as a big explosion in an Italian restaurant, the blood and guts that many horror movie viewers enjoy , is in full swing here and you also get corpses of people who have been picked by the slugs, and lots of snail scenes.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know this Script is a stinker, and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how absurd this filmmaker is to try. "Kim Terry does a decent job as his wife, even if she does not Do much more than what you hold while you are screaming. The "teenagers" were all terrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teens become indecent in bed before being dragged into a horde of bats by a horde of thugs Bedroom of the girl (here male and female nudity).
