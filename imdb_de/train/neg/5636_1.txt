This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no action, but the time you realize, is far beyond the beginning of the film also, so you have to watch to keep still a long time to the total incompetence of the director to recognize, also known as sloth, which plays the tampon chicks in the film, and we do not believe in Willem Dafoe in this film, he's a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know it "apocalypse now" and "the boon dock saintts ", such a script would never be approved. Duh, (Da) enemy wrote this bill along with his twenty-year minus baby. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters Dafoe and Colagrande and then the two screenwriters Dafoe and Colagrande and then the director Cola Grande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the story); Widow meets guy, guy bangs widow, widow shattered windshield guy who hit her. <br /> <br /> title in Netherlands; The black widow (different title, same bullshit). <br /> <br /> SEE THIS MOVIE NOT ON !!! It's a total time!
