This is a really horrible movie. The act (as it is) is completely unreadable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not sure.) <br /> <br /> Half the dialogue is made up of useless stereotypes. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents that (fortunately) the words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the film's only true tragedy is this historic talent as Mary Tyler Moore appeared to be in such a financial or personal situation that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
