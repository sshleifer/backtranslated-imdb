This movie was much too hyped. Many viewers who considered this to be "amazing" must have been in the old school movies because the whole movie plays in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something of the past, so I expected the faded, dreamy pictures to illuminate the characters, but it just went like this. Basically, this was a movie that tried to mix the future with the past, and the two did not mix well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. There are too many films that do exactly what this movie did. So there is no reason for critics to pick up this movie and say, "It's the best movie ever made." It's just crap on a stick. It did not help that the story was so fucking shitty. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to have this film produced, and I also do not understand how actors / actresses in this film are willing to be in a movie like this one. It's almost like everyone is reading the script and forgetting to read the fine print ... "Everything is done on a computer". This was a movie that should have been in a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset that I paid for it. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this film today or tomorrow.
