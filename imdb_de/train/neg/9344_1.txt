As others have pointed out, this movie is a load of overbearing idiots for mindless or masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know, after seeing trainspotting and acid house, that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. In contrast to Trainspotting and Acid House without a good dose of humor or bitter realism, films like this one do not work. More importantly, a movie without a decent script does not work, and there's nothing new, inspiring, or thinking about the film's script. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won a few Baftas shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I found the Aussie film industry pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I would not even borrow it from the weekly papers. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide berth.
