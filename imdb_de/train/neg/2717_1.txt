Do we really need more narcissistic waste in the Baby Boomer generation? Technically speaking, I'm a boomer, though by the time that all "idealistic youths" of the 1960s read Marx, they burned their draft cards and generally extended a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I still remember her well, and nine out of ten were idiotic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive. This is just another exercise of children who never really had anything important to do.
