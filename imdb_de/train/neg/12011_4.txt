John Pressman (Micheal 'I solla Ditech' Lerner) works as a doctor in a doctor's office. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) mesmerizes him to reject the people who think he was wronged. However, this turns out to be a movie within a movie, but the lines soon blur as John goes to a movie theater to kill. Invite a man watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is appropriately exaggerated in this regard, but Zelda keeps repeating lines of dialogue. This gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls watching the movie in a movie. As a horror movie this fails. He's too busy trying to be clever, delivering a message, and seems to forget that making a Slasher movie makes sense, or at least one or two jumps. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: an arthouse house. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
