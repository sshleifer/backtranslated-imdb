Such a long-awaited movie. But it disappointed me and my friends who saw the movie on the first day. The trailers looked like an action movie, but it turned out to be an out & out comedy (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the spectacle of these professional actors. They did their part of the film very well. Good acting, but I do not think that can save the movie. India was beautifully shot. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) Were all saturated with color, all right. However, the way in which the intrinsic beauty of these places was taken let me find out exactly where these places were and when I could go there ;-). <br/> <br /> Action sequences were taken very shabbily, which nobody could do Besides the head and tail of the stunts they used Akki (Akshay Kumar) very well, but could be done much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst thing I've seen in recent movies (90s movies had better animation scenes, I think (first scene where the car falls off) "Flying" should make the road into the lake better <br /> <br /> And the movie name was mentioned mins almost every 20 to 30 just to make sure that the audience does not forget the name of the movie, I guess ..
