I saw this movie in a film school class the other day, and I had not seen an Almodovar movie before, but thought it was good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film in which only a few laughs were mixed with two hours of boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might work in their own films, but together they do not make any meaningful unity. <br /> <br /> Or I thought. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire lesson time explaining all the hidden little details of the movie, such as the mural depicting the stereotypical flamenco dancer in the background of the drag queen scene, a kind of commentary on the lack of identity is Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. Apparently the whole movie is full of clever little visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It is still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good movie - you still have to give the audience a reason to stay attentive, something that interests the viewer enough to really take care of all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us weird, unconventional characters, but keeps them from other movies in the most banal situations, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to say anything. For example, how important is the surprise characteristic of Hitchcock that takes place towards the end of the film? Why is that in it? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene that has to do with a news program. And that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the film consists of nonsensical cinematic references and visual cues that seem to exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it's more than a selfish ruse to make a movie good.
