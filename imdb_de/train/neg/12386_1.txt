It's hard to make an unbiased judgment on such a movie that influenced me so much at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst exploitative movie. I was unhappy enough to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the scariest movie ever made. I saw it again at the beginning of this year and was appalled again. <br /> <br /> I'm not a zealot and do not want to say what others should and should not see, but I was very upset about the way something happened as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie. I love Lowbrow Cinema, but that's just uncomfortable. You prefer to rent Rus Myer.
