"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about movies since "The Exorcist", I think. Seeing that EVP is true, there really was an easy passage to being a dreaded fact. There are not many films that really scare people. As I said, this movie could, but not. The film has evolved into a lower PG-13 movie. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense". Someone really has to take responsibility for the horror film industry and do a movie that not only makes us think, but makes us jump, scream, and anything a horror movie should do. I'm really tired of the PG-13 horror genre because it's becoming a genre of its own. We need the old days, the days of blood and blood, Freddy Kruger, Jason, the days of Mike Myers. Few films can think that this mentality is so scary. So why try to take it off? A few good jumps in this movie are nothing more than one of the dumbest ends of movie history without any resolution. Do not waste your money on this movie.
