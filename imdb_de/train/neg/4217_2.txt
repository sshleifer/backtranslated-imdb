This was recently in AMC's lively movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in harmony with "Journey to the Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed, not only in terms of the acting skills, but also in the stupid plot that comes from a comic book of the five-year-old. Be sure to see the wires clinging to the wings of the pterdactyl as they grab "Ogar," one of the modern idiots who befriend the lost adventurers. The end left it open to reheat the same effects in "The People Who Forgot Time". Do not waste your time.
