I'm stunned how many fans have this show. I did not say that Friends is, at best, an "average" sitcom, and not as good as others have understood. Let's face it, unless Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc were cast, who knows if this show took so long. I doubt that very much. Although the series gradually became more predictable over time, the friends became quieter and duller, because I do not care about the characters - most of whom are the most overrated in television history - or about their plight or who sleeps with whom. And it was funny in the first four seasons, occasionally funny. And even when there were all those A-list Hollywood actors in the movie world, I still did not bother about it. Writing in Friends was stunned when I lost interest in the show from the sixth season on and, as far as the end was concerned, at least it was predictable. <br /> <br /> What was annoying was that it took ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons and were finally canceled out of the air forever. By the time the cast demanded higher salaries, the show would have come to a standstill immediately. In truth, the series was bigger than the actors themselves and not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now there is talk of a reunion show for friends, which will soon appear on our television screens. And yet I'm not looking forward to it.
