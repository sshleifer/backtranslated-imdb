Timberlake's performance almost attacked the screen. It was not all that bad, I just think the role of the reporter was wrong for him. LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, the toughest, meanest guy in the area. I do not think the smile breaks a smile in the movie, not even if suggested to his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman was pretty involved in the whole movie. He had some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. Kevin Spacey was neither good nor bad, he was just "there". <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a Dull movie. bad action. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.
