Let me start with a quote that a friend of mine said when watching this movie: "This entire movie had to be a challenge, you know how 'DUDE, I BET YOU CAN NOT MAKE BAD FILM EVERYONE' ". With this film, they have made a great effort to achieve this title. The effects are of course bad. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every B horror movie. I assume that the actors are in college. But parts of it (especially at the beginning) give the impression that they should be in high school or middle school. That makes no sense. The scarecrow that walks around and kills people is not the slightest pleasure. (SPOILER: In the end, as they sing Lester's name and he reappears, the black and the scarecrow both laugh, probably relieved to see their last scene and the cheesy dialogue.
