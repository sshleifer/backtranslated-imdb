The word in the summary sums it up;) Five girls lose themselves in search of the way home. When they stop in a shop for instructions, they hit a parked car and break a spotlight on it, but suddenly they see a headlight behind them (ooooh). <br /> <br /> Out there shouting, crying and violence when trying to escape this crazy person she lost from a headlight;) well that screaming and crying stays pretty much through the whole movie (very much annoying) The film is filmed, with a cheap camera he tries to make it "real" or "shocking" I think, it's just embarrassing and useless. With nothing better to compare with "Blair Witch Style". <br /> <br /> The screaming and crying after pretty much the whole movie with the crappy sound was overly annoying, you literally get a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but that was not scary just an annoying, painful piece of crap film.
