First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and get started. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman does his masters, which is why he wastes nearly a third of the movie for these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc goes nowhere. He just proves to us that Hackman is closely watched and that everything he says or does is known to the masters. Another 20 minutes. Then wasting time to show the reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken at most 10-15 minutes to allow for real action, intrigue and plot twists. When the action started, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as always, and so are the other actors, but this is a dudel of prime importance.
