I remember the BSG pilots. I can describe this night exactly. I remember which chair I was sitting on. This show was magical. It became alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed parts of the third year and have faithfully seen every episode of the fourth year in great hope that it would somehow turn. Well, I did not. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and was thrilled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes and they get boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the dramatic political correctness of his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Many of his work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, that was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of the episodes of the first BSG series. When they said goodbye to a meeting with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, everything went into the pot. It was as if he had written the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will get better. Maybe it was just a few weak first episodes. But I am very, very nervous.
