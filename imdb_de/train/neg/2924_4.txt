There was something wrong with the female lead, had this perfect life she had always wanted to the worst possible life started out as child prostitutes to Eric Roberts here. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain, and that destroys it in the end. It sounds strange, but I like the position that Dean Cain had at the end and the decision he has taken. He can not hurt her because he loves her and the mother of his child is (I think the time frame makes it clear that it is his child and not his brother). sleeping with his brother (which is the love and commitment shows that he considered a way) then and to be part of his death. In better hands this would have been a better film, but for something that I found on late-night cable, it is not bad.
