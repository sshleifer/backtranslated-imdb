This is the biggest dunghill I've ever seen. DO NOT RENT! The creators of this film should be a band that has ever made another film. It starts with an action that quickly turns into nothing. I think I would rather dry paint than look at the cover. The actors were terrible, the plot faded quickly, the filming left a lot to do. Not a good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie, you lose your money. I really like National Lampoon movies, but that was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn, act, produce and learn to lead. I feel like I should sue those A holes that made this movie for money that was wasted because of the rental cost and lost time.
