Avoid this, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a major sin in a French movie. <br /> <br /> This film attempts to combine western, drug and ancien regime costume epic. What? Well, think twice. The cowboy music is funny in sword fighting. Or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Somebody should make a "What's Up Tiger Lily" with this bomb. Rewrite the script and then dub it in subtitles. Heck, that's almost it. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American public, have roles.)
