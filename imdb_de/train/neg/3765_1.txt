I have always been interested in everything about Bigfoot. So when I was looking for a movie to rent, I noticed this. It was the worst $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please do not waste money on it !! This was one of the cheapest movies I have ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I rolled a lot with my eyes and did not see it all the way. I'm just tired of it. The acting was terrible, the effects were terrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. All in all, it was a really bad, boring movie and a waste of time and money. I hope that someday they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then I have to deal with countless cheap guys like this to find the true masterpiece.
