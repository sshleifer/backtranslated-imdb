A small town is being attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a single avenger and a group of composite survivors. <br /> <br /> published in 1993, "Darkness" gained a cult which emerged after his release. It is easy to see why - it's loaded with Gore (and I mean, damn fully loaded), and it's energy and enthusiasm, as you would with other no-budget cult horror films like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback". is actually quite contagious. <br /> <br /> Even if that's true, it's not enough to save it. The film was shot on a Super 8, so that the image is grainy and dark, which makes seeing very difficult (it would have been great if it had concealed the terrible mullet of the protagonists.) Even the soundtrack consisting of the annoying Casio there would be heard Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what is it with these no-budget horror flicks and bad death metal?) Although it does not expect any Oscar-worthy performances, the drama still an amateur hour when the Actors sometimes seem almost confused Instead of being anxious or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of no-budget gorefests will love this. Everyone else, however, wants some more meat on their ribs.
