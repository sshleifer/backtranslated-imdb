Unreal "movie", what were these people ?? A mix of French upstairs downstairs, mating horses, pornography (not suggested, quite full for a movie) and bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music and chase scenes whose sounds are crazy, and even more so. ** Spoiler ** It plods awkwardly for a while, .... .... then a lamb makes a runner who makes a woman in an old robe run after him, she goes into the forest, where she is on her I am an upright "penis" who is associated with a male in a bear / rat male suit. I say it this way, as it is obvious that the "penis" is responsible and has too much time on the screen. In short, it turned out that she liked a bit of bear / rat fiends & that was it, the rest is just upholstery. ** Final Corruptor ** A movie made to shock and insult, and that's the way it is talked about. Any advertisement is a good advertisement, really a waste of time, but the "main event" has to be seen, it's hard to believe Imagine someone thought it was a good idea when they filmed it.
