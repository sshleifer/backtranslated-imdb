There are really two sections of this movie. First, there's the film's ridiculous prologue, which is so hysterical and insane that it almost seems appropriate that The Simpsons Troy McClure should make the narrative. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie starts (starting with a theme song that really does not fit the rest of the movie) that is technically sound but is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense. <br /> <br/> This is especially the case with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who allegedly had been involved in the storyline and part of the "organization" all along, but what would have happened if Hackman had made the seemingly arbitrary decision to him take away break? In that case, he would have been a superfluous and unnecessary character, which he still is in the end. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the movie is that it is not willing at all, who or what is detailed is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers do not have the courage to point out that a particular section of society would be able to establish such an organization, instead filling the hope that a lack of explanations would suffice and the public would own its own Conclusions. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film fails at all levels.
