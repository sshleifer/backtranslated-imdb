I have not seen anything so bad since leaving the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to get through the part just because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this movie has failed miserably in all areas of filmmaking. The characters were made of cardboard and could cause no sympathy. The story was absolutely incredible. The acting was with the exception of Swinton amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was there. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber has agreed to appear in such a fool, but she most likely regrets it now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or your time with this stinker. There's nothing to see here.
