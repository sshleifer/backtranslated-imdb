Yes. I admit it. I believed in all the hype surrounding this work, the problems and suffering of 6 people living in Mexico City for their sex lives. And so I really expected to finally see a Mexican movie that was both popular and interesting. Unfortunately, the movie was completely disappointing. The story introduces us to two couples, both of whom have very obvious marital problems. When a third party enters the life of each couple, his or her problems reach a critical point. Or absolutely absurd. The action then becomes a battle of the sexes. The attitude of each group (yes, they are literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is obviously stupid and childish (I think the humor should be there). And everything is even worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr. Bichir), with Serrano doing an excellent job on his opera. The shallow circumstances that make up the storyline, the one-dimensional characters, the very bad (though not stupid) perception of what sex is in a mature relationship make the movie fail. Miserably. SPyL was well received at the box office (impressive). Believe the hype at your own risk.
