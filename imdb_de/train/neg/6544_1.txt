I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I felt torn off, but then I thought about it and I would be grateful. I have found a holy grail, a true touchstone for bad cinema. If you think that the first dramatic footage of an empty stadium is hissing successfully with Evel's awkward camera address monologue, wait until the opening credits run on the chauffeur's butt. The script seems to be made up of press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ..... I just can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely nothing to do with anything he says, the only internal monologue I can discover is "God, I bet they believe, I'm cute, really cute!". This is an epiphany! I know now how bad it can be.
