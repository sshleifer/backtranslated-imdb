I have to be the one in America who did not like this movie. I think that was just not my style or anything, I just do not see what's so intriguing about it. <br /> <br /> It's about a man who came from nowhere and becomes a drug lord. Pretty easy way to describe a whole movie, and that's what I feel about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, a movie does not automatically make a great movie just because of mafias / drug trafficking / criminal groups. Do not forget the good storytelling.
