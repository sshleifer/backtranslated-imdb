The stereotypical sending of Slasher-Flicks is far removed as alleged entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby and the entire cast are completely wasted. Lame jokes abound and every punch line is well-wired. The stupid deposits occur at a fast pace and almost everyone falls flat like a crushed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and continues throughout the movie. Another drawback is the claustrophobic attitude, which is located entirely within the walls of a deserted high school. Avoid this and look for one of "Lampoon's" really funny movies like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
