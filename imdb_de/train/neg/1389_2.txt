I was very disappointed in this movie. Plotwise, it was faintly silly bordering: souls who can influence reality as they do? A mission that seems critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole B story with the "Holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the broadcaster was so horrible that I eventually came across the TV, "Why waste my time on it?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "River of Souls" did not go deeper into the soul than the original episode "Soul Hunter". We see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not get a feel for their culture. (Are there female soul hunters?) <br /> <br /> The acting was fine given the material they had to work with and the special effects - especially the first-act planetary landscape - were very impressive. But by and large, I would say that I miss this one.
