This horribly bad garbage manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, and he pretends to be chic and sophisticated. Cruel performances, a clich√©-ridden script and a boring director make this movie an experience. Two scenes were particularly offensive - the scene in which Schaech scratches his tongue after a kiss from another man (it could have been really so disgusting) and the scene in which Eastwood is kissed by Schaechs best friend pretending to be Russian to be. After leaving the room, she exclaims "f ** king foreigner"! So much for a cultural artist who dreams of living in Paris? Jonathon Schaech can be a sympathetic actress on screen and looks amazingly good. It's a shame that he has not learned from working with leading gay director Gregg Araki in an earlier film and is trying to save this film from descent into a series of gay stereotypes and a swamp of homophobia.
