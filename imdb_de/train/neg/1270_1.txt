Herculis Puaro is generally an established "hero" that we know from books and movies. This movie or story does not work and I felt it was not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the performers exaggerate and make stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) looks wrong, and for the serious spectator who thinks twice, that this movie is more of a comedy can be the mystery drama. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro does a good job, but nothing fabulous. The scenes are, as I said, perfect and seem fake. The story is not very charming, though it's a murder mystery, but who cares about the death of a stupid and vicious blonde woman in the Iraqi desert ?! The "victim" is not sympathetic.
