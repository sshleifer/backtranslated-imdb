This is a weird sex comedy because there is very little comedy, but a lot of sex, most of which take place in the back of a car and are so graphic that BASIC INSTINCT looks like an issue of TELETUBBIES. I do not make you funny, the sex in this movie is so in your face that it might stifle you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO There is not much else to mention except the language in which every single sentence seems to contain the F-word. This is a pretty bleak hyperrealistic British movie made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films
