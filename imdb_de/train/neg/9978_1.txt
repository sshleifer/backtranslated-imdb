My girlfriend and I were stunned at how bad this movie was. After fifteen minutes we would have given it up unless we were too curious to see if the movie could possibly save itself. That did not do it. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise given to this movie. The writing was downright horrible and was delivered by some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly annoyed me about this movie was that people often talked to each other was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a sense of awkwardness (as in luck). This was not such a break - it was just bad governance. This movie might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this movie, because then the inner dialogue and the bad drama would not be perceived that much. <br /> <br /> I generally like this kind of little quirky movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but they failed on so many levels that I think they are one of the worst movies they ever did I played through in the last few years.
