Okay, I went into this movie and did not really expect much that I saw an action movie like The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars, some nice girls who have a decent storyline. Unfortunately, I have to say that this was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were nice and the girls were alright, but the way they put the movie together was just shabby, to put it nicely. History never got you interested in the cast, and the movie just seemed to be composed. Overall, this movie was far from the worst, but if you are looking for a movie for this weekend, I would pass this movie on for now.
