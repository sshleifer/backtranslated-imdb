After eagerly waiting until the end, I have to say that I wish I was not involved in the whole series. The last episode was all about the last seven years. It ruined everything. The trip lasted 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why do not you avoid the whole adventure? Crew members died all the time. Why does she just want to save Seven of Nine? The others do not count or what? The most ridiculous part, when the crew says homecoming is not really the most important thing for them. As I said, "travel is more important than the destination". Incredible. And in the final, the ships are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about the landing and the return to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end of time.
