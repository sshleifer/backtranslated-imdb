Very stupid movie, filled with stupid deposits and Jewish references. It was a serious movie, but it could not be taken seriously. A familiar film presentation ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A cruel subplot involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too regimented. I've noticed that the skills of Al Pacinos seem to be going downhill. A problem solver with problems, but nothing more disturbing than Pacino's awful Atlanta accent. The damage control has to fix this damage of a movie. OK, my one-liners are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This movie is not only boring, but also repulsive. Usually a revolting film is seen for the wrong reasons. This movie is hard to beat. I managed to get through this. The plot, though a bit better written, with perhaps a little better acting and elimination of the terrible subplot and even stupid jokes, could have pulled this thriller out of the jerk. What's left is a stupid, stupid movie that made sure Eli Wurman got drilled in his head because he was Jewish. An embarrassment for all the good Jewish people everywhere.
