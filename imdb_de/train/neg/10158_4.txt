I can not help but think behind the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (a massively more amazing film) when you look at this, because of the realistic feeling as well as the great innovative idea. That could have been a great movie. the spectacle is ... okay by some actors. from others ... it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the idea is great and the format is great. the story is also pretty good, though she often suffers from the logical reason under heavy blows. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that, though? After all, it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want it to be redone ... I really want it to be the awesome movie that it wants to be. <br /> <br /> however (and you can not really blame the heads behind the movie). This is obviously based on a shoe string budget. and the movie really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... when you exchange for a better acting and slightly better effects. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote it should go on, great idea here.
