... and how they got you out of your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies of the '70s, with no actors, no embarrassing screenplays, unfortunate directing, and a relentless desire to merge "horror" with light comedy. This film introduces a paleontologist who sees drawings of a water dinosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor crashes from the sky, and a clay dinosaur's water dinosaur begins to terrorize and feed the people around Crater Lake. The whole thing is done by Steve, our local sheriff. Much of the movie - if it does not show any bloody pools that we believe has been the beast food - will be spent on the grumpy face of two guys called Arnie and Mitch who hire a boat. They try so badly to be funny that we get lines looking at a business sign, Mitch says to Arnie, "They wrote misshapen, it's B-A-T-E written." The laugh was rather scarce here. Then we see them drinking together and imagine a tree trunk as a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy take care! The dinosaur looks spotty, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And at least the lake is beautiful.
