For a TV horror movie the movie started very interesting. I was really fascinated by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the end was a total disappointment. The movie was going very fast and got to a very climatic end. But guess what, what has no end. The movie is over and after almost an hour and a half the audience wonders what has happened. Why were not all unanswered questions answered in the movie? There was no explanation for the main points of the plot. This movie is like seeing a murder mystery and never finding out who did it. Very disappointed This movie looks like the producers just have no money and never finished the movie. A real BOMB!
