I will keep this as short as possible, since this crap hardly needs to be mentioned. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - topped with Schnaas' other terrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I managed (almost ...) somehow to get through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so awfully inappropriate - even compared to Schnaas' other terrible movie - that I had to go through everything after the first 10 minutes. Zero acting skills, awkward blood, terrible camcorder-like camera work, ridiculous dubbing ... it just keeps going on and on. I really can not find a single thing to save on this garbage - and usually I find that SOMETHING finds salvation in almost every movie. This is really one of the worst movies ever made - you were warned ... 1/10
