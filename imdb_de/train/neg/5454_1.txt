Wow, this movie was just awful. SO in fact so bad that I wanted to repay my money even though I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> The movie is about nothing incomprehensible. It's a mish-mash of science-fiction clichés that has been bettered by much more experienced filmmakers. The performances, especially by the leads, were exaggerated in a less charming way by Ed Wood. If one speaks of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the dialogue of the character. It's just too silent, without a hint of irony or humor. Moreover, it makes no sense, not even the plot or the absence of it. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they seem to be easy to be "cool" rather than a good plotter to be. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mish-mash of things that never really set any mood. Again, it seemed like the director was simply inserting songs into the movie to be "cool." <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my last point. If the director had actually been more concerned about the storyline, the story, and the dialogue, rather than trying to be "cool," he would not have made such a silly cliché out of a short film. <br /> <br />
