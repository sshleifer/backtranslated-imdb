Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of wretched men). Joe Don Baker is looking for an Italian gangster. Joe Don's character is Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this film is to shoot people and get arrested time and again. Everyone in the movie hates him, as does any Greydon Clark. I liked an earlier Greydon picture "Angel's Revenge" because it was one year old for the Thrites. Avoid this movie at any price !!
