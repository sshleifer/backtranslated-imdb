If I could give it less, I would do it. Not to rent trouble; If someone gives you the DVD, burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie production. A total waste of even digital "films". I saw better on youtube made by 12 year old boy. Lommel claims to have written this. In this case, it is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The plot does not exist, the dialogue screams above all, the camera work is a kind of attempted art enjoyment with nonsensical clipping of completely disconnected jumps either to industrial transport scenes or to a kind of strange, angry young woman I can usually follow a less obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This is either so far beyond my limited understanding skills that I've missed it or it's completely pointless. I think this is a "let's see if we can get a title that will be out soon, and make a weird crack on it and see if we can get some of the money," con job. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Lionsgate took care of that at all. Totally worthless, it's so bad that I will not hire another from this director.
