Although this film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, it is surprising to see on several levels. First, it is interesting for old movie fans to see the lead role of Dean Jagger (not related to Mick). While Jagger later took on a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even earning the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance here is truly one-of-a-kind as he actually has a full head of hair (I've never seen him like he did before). and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This movie simply shows that an actor who can not act in his previous films does not mean that he can not learn to become a good actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. A second reason to watch the movie is the scissorsiness of everything. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian waded through the water, it is obvious that they are really just walking in place and the background behind them is being badly projected. Plus, once they have left the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Horrible continuity and thoughtless bad dialogue are omnipresent throughout the movie - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to join the film - both starring in many class Z horror movies. In many ways, this would be a perfect example of a film lesson about NOT making a movie. <br /> <br /> So if you give a 3, it's probably a bit over the top, but it's fun to laugh about and short, so it's worth a look for bad movie fans.
