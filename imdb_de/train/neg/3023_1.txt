It's rare for me to find a movie so terrible, annoying and irritating. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy, if it is not confusing and meaningless about striking cut, is ridiculous. Why was Domino such a hard bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a kid and this "traumatic" event has emotionally disabled her and hates everyone. If the dialogue is not clich√©d or banal, it is littered with ridiculous lines, such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At some point, the bounty hunters have a man in the bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, they roll their sleeves off the arm with a shotgun instead of rolling up their sleeves and just reading the number. At another point, the bounty hunters bring a bomb to a mafia-scheduled meeting and threaten to drop the bomb unless the mafia lets them go !? It would obviously have been too easy not to go to the meeting. Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terribly mismanaged. Mickey Rourke has managed to save some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance was one, but all I could think of was that it had been made by a complete idiot.
