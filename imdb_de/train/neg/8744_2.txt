I somehow accidentally saw this movie. I'm still not sure if I'm sorry or not. I felt like I was watching the movie of this group of film students who did not quite make the cut. It plays out every imaginable Hollywood clich√© and whips us away with the message "Business is the ultimate evil." Subtle, this movie does not know. In this respect, he even succeeds in providing his own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be the fantasy world of a computer nerd. The main character is an attractive teenager with a girlfriend, but he's a programming genius and an obvious hacker (I think), along with many other nerd fantasy elements that you have to see for yourself. <br /> Besides, I should have known that it would be a Z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good hint. Can not recommend it One, I'm scared.
