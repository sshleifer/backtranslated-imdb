Another variation and improvisation to the famous and popular children's story, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast, tries to imagine (very vivid and what is offensive and disturbing, but in fact rather stupid and funny), what actually happened between beauty and that Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this film. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and dark exploration of issues such as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horror erotic movie. It is more of a parody in all genres it touches or mentions, even though there are shocking moments in all departments that will surely be remembered. <br /> <br /> The long (far too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrible but ridiculous I've ever seen in the movie creature with really impressive ... well anatomy is on the clavichord Music by Scarlatti set and hysterical. My husband and I laughed aloud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. The moral of the scene is - Beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience of the film? For an erotic picture it is too wordy; for an art film - there are too many breathtaking scenes of madness and I would say an abrupt end. IMO, the filmmaker, did not want it to be a serious drama. As a parody of Arthouse / horror / erotic it is funny and certainly original. Laugh well and do not try to look for meaning. This story of the curious beauties and lustful beasts is certainly not recommended for seeing together with the children. The opening scene, which can shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous Bestiality scene, can be successfully used on the Discovery Channel for the program "In the World of Animals - Mating Habits and Horse Rituals".
