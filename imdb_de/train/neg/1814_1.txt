All these reviewers are exactly right. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me and that beats everything! <br /> <br /> This is not just a "so bad, it's good" waste of time, but a real, funny movie cruelty. <br /> <br /> CHECK the white furry monster style! <br /> <br /> Let yourself be laughed at Thom Christopher's "Spell Weaving" campaign! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISCOUNT! on the threadbare sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of these "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear some of the people participating in "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" do not know they're in a movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! I saw this movie on HTV Wales late in the evening when I was suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to find a copy a few weeks later to make sure it was really that terrible. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more adorable than any of John Derek's films. This is really the Citizen Kane of Trash.
