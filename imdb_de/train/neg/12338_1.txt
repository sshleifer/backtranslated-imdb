I originally saw this movie in the theater when I was ten years old. Even at this age, the humor offended my youthful intelligence. <br /> <br /> Earlier, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff goldblum I would shudder and feel very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt that way. It seems that I have blocked my memory of this film, but my negative feelings about two of the perpetrators remained behind. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie, but I subconsciously mourned the parts of my soul that had been stolen, even from the creators of this inhumane work EATEN as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process, I should probably try to counter this childhood fear so that I * really * can leave it behind. Regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea.
