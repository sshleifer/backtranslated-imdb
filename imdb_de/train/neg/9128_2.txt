Even though they did not know that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and had died before the release of the film, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful. Presumably this is a Lampoon by Sax Rohmers famous oriental villain, but he lacks any focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. In fact, the film uses racist insults. There are hardly any real jokes or jokes, only mostly actors who act idiotically and spray dark lines. It is particularly troubling to see Sid Caesar forced to issue curses and racist explanations for ridiculed laughs. Most other actors also embarrass themselves. <br /> <br /> And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the double role of sinister Fu Manchu trying to put together a formula to recapture his youth and his unwavering British foe Nayland Smith. Seller is not one hundred percent bad; He gives a quirky warmth when Smith talks about his fetishistic attachment to his lawnmower, and he strangely moves as a manchu when he expresses his love of English music hall entertainment. Most of the time he plays both roles with tired grimness and thus sabotages all odd possibilities. The routines of Sellers, in which he revives his fading power by electric shocks, are particularly distressing. he seems too convincingly tormented to be funny. <br /> <br /> Some really funny lines, a matching slapstick by Burt Kwouk (Cato in the films of PINK PANTHER) as one of Manchu's henchmen, and Helen Mirren's amusing music can not save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is a comedic genius, he will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
