Left Behind is a kind of "we know what we know because we know it" movie that Christians (and most other naive people) need to make them feel what they "THINK" and "BELIEVE" ( not "KNOWLEDGE") are right. But at the same time, I feel bad for the little boys, because this is not a well-made movie. It does not help a message. I work in a video library and I know the ONLY reason why people saw this movie was because they were religious and thought it was like this. EVERYONE on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they believe they know nothing. I had about enough (but only after having had too much) of these people walking around with their noses in the air, thinking that watching movies with a semi-talented television actor meant something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you stay away. I refuse to go into details about this movie (not because AI did not see him (because I did)), B-it was too shocking for my atheist to handle it (because it was not) or CI really I can not say anything bad about it (because I do that). The reason (that's a word that has helped no one to make this movie) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want it to be done. My head, I want to make ALL of it out of my mind I wanna see the message Kirk gives so proudly and culturally at the end of the movie, I just want all the things that were before I watch the movies there, it's all directly related to this movie, that floats in my head, EXPERIENCE! My peaceful anger stops. I'm sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie what might happen in the future (but not) if they had Seven Dollars Plus to any number of human, animal or rainforest charities but if they did then they could not "believe" that it really is, they may need to know what is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (out of ****)
