I had to give this movie a 1 because it's so bad, but do not remember that I did not like it because I laughed and laughed and even had some questions. Half the time I laughed, half the time I said, "What the hell is going on here?" or "why would anyone do that?" and so on. I enjoyed the horrible fog effects, the nude scene of the 80s / battle / dialogues / nude scene and the way the warrior's swords flutter in the wind when riding their horses. And there are a few crappy model effects (it should not be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand this guy they find in the cave. What the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these films and I thought I would try and I basically liked the movie as people like Ed Wood movies. I do not really enjoy what the movie should be, I look at it in my own funny way. So do not be distracted if you really thought this was an action movie. I just liked it for other reasons. It's a lot, much worse than Evil Dead, so you can actually think you're wasting your life by watching it (which came to my mind a few times). I think the best thing for most people would be to have some drinks, make friends and laugh about this movie. Maybe that's a bit tough, but I do not think so, rent it and you'll see. Yo.
