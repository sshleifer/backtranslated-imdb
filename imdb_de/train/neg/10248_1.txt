The end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the box, but be warned that it's bad. As a big fan of mega-star actor Christopher Lee, I was deceived. Like tentacles (77), a good cast does not mean it's a good movie. At first it looks promising, then it gets boring, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. The rest of the cast is shown Lew ayres, Dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I'd expect better from Charles Band, who made good movies like the re-animater and dolls. I heard that Christopher Lee got involved in the movie. He said his co-stars were Jose Ferrer, John Carridin and Dean Jagger. Well, Dean Jagger is here, but the other two never made it (luckily) if you make a movie about the end of the world and use a bigger budget better storyline.dean Jagger went on to make two good films: Alligator (80) and Death of Death (79). Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie, without her lollipop the world that I could dare to awaken throughout the movie. 1 out of 10.
