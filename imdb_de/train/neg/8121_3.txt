Time is money. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was full and everyone left the same reaction: is this the movie critics rave about? What a crap! <br /> <br /> The catch on this movie is the upwardly mobile black daughter who seeks and finds her white garbage family. Get it? <br /> <br /> The acting is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps over a 60-minute story. The characters are flat and unintelligent. I was offended by the fact that these people could not figure out what was obviously obvious to the audience; The audience murmured on the big screen what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun washing.
