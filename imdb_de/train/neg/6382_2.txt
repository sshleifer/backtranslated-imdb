It's hard to know what Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg's minds went through when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the movie is being billed as a comedy, but there are no real jokes besides the raw character names (Capt. B Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is a (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronized voice-overs (with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of emotion), 'futuristic' computer ads with misspellings and a conspiracy making almost no sense. <br /> <br /> Even though 65% of viewers rated this film as a perfect 10 out of 10, that's the exact opposite of what a good movie is. It may be SUFFICIENT to look at a few friends, but this movie only earns a "2" out of ten ... slightly higher than the lower possible rating just because the authors somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie.
