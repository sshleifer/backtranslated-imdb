All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what you are making movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters, I urge you to investigate. It's weird to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that sound even more absurd as you speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the role as Mr. Cahill goes to school with only three students and kicks his ass. This movie was hard as an afternoon special. Who had the idea of ​​wearing hats that said where a particular gangbanger came from? I guess real gangbangers do not wear hats and claim their ties. That would be stupid considering new laws that extend a prison sentence if a person refers to a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made.
