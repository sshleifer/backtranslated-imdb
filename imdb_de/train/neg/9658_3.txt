My God, what an incredible movie! It reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's film "We were Soldiers" when "the company is not lost, they are just cut off". And the other scene in Pearl Harbor when the British officer to Ben Affleck says "If all." Americans are like you, then God helps the nation that goes to war with America! <br /> <br /> If you put all 3 films together, you will have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the truncated battalion may be real enough, but the film could have done without all the American preaching jingo propaganda: during the above scene in Pearl Harbor there was an audible moan in the cinema (no Joke)) The lost battalion is really in a class of its own? "The Americans think they are unbeatable," inspired bravery. "I actually flinched and was damn near when I spit out all the spasm that was broadcast during this catastrophic disaster (the movie is). <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were well done (3 stars for that), but if the script is crap, then even wrapped in colorful ribbons, it's still crap. The author, James Carabatsos, also wrote these other screams: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge. Someone, please shoot him before he writes such garbage. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy, is also Australian, God, the shame !!!
