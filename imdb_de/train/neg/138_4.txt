The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time and it really scared me. The acting was not so bad and the "Amor" killer was believable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The plot and plot of this movie are incredibly weak. There just was not much. The way the killer killed his victims was very horrible and disgusting. I can not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle Gore. <br /> <br /> All in all: a good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
