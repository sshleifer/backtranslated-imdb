I will not address and criticize RAW's theories. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie is delivering or well done, and not a site debating philosophy. <br /> <br /> After this has been said, this video is really going strong. It's a talking attitude from RAW to the other. Some of them are archival videos so you can see how it has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. Otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a weird comparison, but I kept thinking about the Sunday afternoon when I saw some of Barbra Streisand's stargazing * Funny Lady * (another, really bad movie). After a while, I was so excited about Barbra, I always wish there was a scene she would not show up in. You know, "in the meantime, other characters in the movie had something else ..." moment. But it was about Barbra. Well, this video is RAWs * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So, if you imagine the idea of ​​having a good time, look at several of RAW's facial settings and angles as he ripples with his theories that are put together in a lame structure that does not interest or Insight, then be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
