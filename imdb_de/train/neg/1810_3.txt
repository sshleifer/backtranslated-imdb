Consider this movie as a Saturday live action program from a long time ago. Even the little tykes will find it hard, because it runs like molasses! I can not understand how horrible it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume section! Too many Warrior Wizard movies have used the same old storyline several times, but this is extremely rare considering its attractiveness to little pets. And who would have made a topless mermaid in the world at all? I thought that would be a "family movie"! MST3K, here is another gem for your 1999 TV season!
