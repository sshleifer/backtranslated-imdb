This film had a great cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey and Lew Ayres - all solid B-movie actors. But this downer of a movie did not use any of them to any advantage, and none of their characters even met on screen (though Christopher Lee has to face in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change right away. First, they just want to fix and ship their ship, then turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after giving them the crucial part they need. Out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides that they must destroy the planet because it causes too many "illnesses" (though they offer the protagonist and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br Most of the movie is spent watching the man and his wife running or standing around or sitting at desks and doing nothing. They almost wish they had been taken along with the rest of the planet just for revenge because they bore us to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you like Chris Lee or the low budget science fiction of the 70s I would miss this one. It falls into this narrow area of ​​wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
