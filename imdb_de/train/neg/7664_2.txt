Spoiler ahead, but is that really important? Have you ever read a movie review that is made up entirely of questions? Could it be that? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts around the world? Why was this question never answered? Why was the initial text incoherent? Why should a nun (she seemed really nice!) Hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the shafts of the gold mine enter the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment to have sex? (Or have I just answered my own question?) Why did even a non-archaeologist open an obviously valuable, solid gold box with a sledgehammer? Why do modern computers still show green outlines of objects before the Tron era with little "peeps"? And do all the movie explosion timers have digital displays? Why does EVERYTHING make no sense in this movie?
