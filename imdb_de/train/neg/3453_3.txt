It seems that more attention has been paid to the IMDb reviews of this film than to the source. <br /> <br /> Here is a non-claim review: <br /> <br /> Only if you think that nothing works It does not happen. <br /> <br /> Disguise yourself at will, this is a boring movie full of unencumbered characters with little interest. <br /> <br /> One you can imagine If you want to convince an impressive emo chick that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> Not something you can see for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> unless. <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> presumption.
