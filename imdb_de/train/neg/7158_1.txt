This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I love Almereydas Nadja, but that's just shit. Apart from a few interesting moments of interesting cinematography and music, this movie is just bad acting and stupid material. Jared Harris is especially bad, but nobody is good at the distance. The plot is a joke, but not the kind of haha. I do not even know if you can forgive such bad movies. Please delete the last one and a half hours of my life. How did this director Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
