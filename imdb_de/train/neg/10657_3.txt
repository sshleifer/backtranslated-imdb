I had high hopes in this movie and looked at it with many expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has forever marked his footsteps in the sands of time. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After watching the movie, the brutality and violence in Tenebra and Clockwork Orange looks much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Raghavan is a very daring police officer. Who is assigned to an investigation of brutal serial killings. Raghavan finds the connection efficiently in this case and is about to solve the murders and the psycho-killer, two psychologically disturbed, but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they flee and get into a murder rush. After all, Raghavan kills both after he has saved many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho killers are what will keep the audience from going to the theater. The murders, sexual harassment and rape are shown very clearly without which the film could have survived. <br /> <br /> To even imagine that teenagers and children will see this movie in the theater, and a picture that he has to paint in his mind is certainly not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has a certain obligation to society and its listeners. Certainly, I never go to the movies that look like Gautham's name on the production list.
