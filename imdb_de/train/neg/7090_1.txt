I fell asleep on my couch last night at 7:35 pm and saw Larry Sanders (usually I did it, but not last night). Woke up at 3am (West Coast investment banker) and was intrigued to see this on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this "movie" was. Serious. shocked. I was so shocked that I had to comment on iMDB. That's really bad. The writing is boring, but the direction and editing are just below those of a freshman at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, a video is being shot. However, this is recorded on VIDEO, not on DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The clips from skateboarding videos have a more "cinematic" feel than this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the bad directors, but I can not remember anything. The recordings and the blocking are stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not daring, not brave, not boring, just stupid. I know that the people who review this review say, "Give me an example." I can not. It was 3 o'clock in the morning. But trust me, I know that you will see it anyway, you are attracted by the terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
