Wow, how bad can it get? That was really bad. Not in terms of the Gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. The story was awful - the main feature character arc was a total joke. Within a few nights after following Vinnie Jones, he begins to cry as he photographs his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers so childish, suggestible and weak? His character development had absolutely no justification or meaning - and in the end, you are laughed at for the absolutely predictable and utterly absurd turn his character takes. The bloody moments were clearly justified by a feeble, self-confident attempt to jump on the modern MTV style Gore wagon - all cgi, blood, but no real emotion. These parts were unintentionally funny - distracting by their self-confidence - crazy camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie commits the crime of waking up another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (up to the stupid monsters at the end) is in favor of "self-assured direction". This film was not made for and by the public, but for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.
