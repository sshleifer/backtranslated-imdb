THE SEVENTEEN CHARACTER has a big opening hook as the Israeli defense encounters a terrorist base. This is the kind of hook that is a must when writing a script. She captures the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon as he leases a room by Abby and Russell Quinnn, which telegraphs the point that this is a man who is not who he says he is. However, after the big third of the opening, I found the rest of the film confusing and confusing with a large number of plotholes and not too different from myriad other supernatural thrillers I've ever seen
