Incredible. Does it get anything stupid? No chance. The stupidity in this movie would even shame Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had a mediocre dialogue and the second part a bad dialogue, then this part has a cretinous dialogue. Amazing. But this time, history has also been lowered to the level of dialogue. Despite acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will certainly kill the series. The completely idiotic conspiracy comes so obviously from the pen of a frustrated left. <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder if such leftists even realize how anti-democracy and dictatorship they are. In this movie, they are obviously aimed at the US? a democracy Why do not they target anti-military films against Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc.? Sure, most of these places are not likely to produce such a cube soon, but that does not matter. It is obvious: writers like this admire this kind of regime, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go so far as to say that EVERYONE who stubbornly attacks US foreign policy has anti-democratic convictions at its core. Back to the movie: Apart from being so far-fetched That it's not funny anymore, the movie has many obvious illogicalities. For some reason, for example, the two men who oversee the cube have worked for some time and are unaware of the pain and sadism the project entails, but the first one suddenly turns against the system ! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature will see through this idiocy. Or how about this criminal character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. Once this creature appears, the movie loses ALL seriousness and thus the chance to be exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
