What a long, drawn out, senseless movie. I'm sure this movie is historically appealing, but in terms of entertainment, it just does not make the mark. Ralph Fiennes has been involved in some fantastic films, the English Patient, Schindler's list, but this one was such a failure. There seemed to be nowhere to go, his character in the beginning was so flat and excited that I wondered that his "sister" would ever have been interested. Do not hesitate to borrow this movie, but instead buy a copy of the English patient.
