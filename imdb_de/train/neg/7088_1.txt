I was exposed to this cruelty by my wife, trying to turn it off after 10 minutes, but was forced by the whole thing. This must undoubtedly be the cruelest appearance of any movie ever played ... <br /> <br /> There were great scripting moments like: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If she gets ready right here, she'll get a bonus "Madam -" A Boner? "Sammy -" No, a bonus "<br /> <br /> Conclusion: Horrible script, terrible spectacle and unbelievably illogical.
