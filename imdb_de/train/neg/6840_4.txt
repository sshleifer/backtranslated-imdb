While this excursion certainly can not compete with its predecessor, it has more than a part of the unforgettable moments. My personal favorite, shortly after we devastated a city block with its "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. When a single tear comes off his left eye, we know at this point that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can not help but be drawn into his emotional turmoil, and we understand that his previously shallow affect was just a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! The sex scenes show a nice balance, carnal but not pornographic. After that, I felt that I had a pretty good understanding of working with the Magnavision Videodisc Player. Too bad they have not produced them for over 25 years.
