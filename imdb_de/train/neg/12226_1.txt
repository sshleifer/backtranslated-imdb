I know, I know, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the worst movie or maybe "Manos, the hands of fate". But I can not get upset about these sock monkey movies. Of course they are bad. How can you be good? But if you're talking about films with respectable production values ​​and bankable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl." All the dizzying folly, all the selfishness that stains everything that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its climax in this film. "Yentl" looks back from his lonely peak of horror "A star is born" and looks forward to "The mirror has two faces". There is nothing else as it is. I would rather not speculate what kind of emotional weak point Streisand has expelled to make this film, and for which audience she sounded, I can not imagine, though I bet there's a nine-to-ten chance You are not a member /> <br /> Nobel Peace Laureate and Holy Guardian of Yiddish Literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did with his story that he publicly blew it up. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that not only did she not commit suicide, she also made horrific films.
