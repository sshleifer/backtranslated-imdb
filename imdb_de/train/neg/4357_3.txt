A group of friends meet a family of terrible cannibals as they camp in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of the "mutated cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills that are inbred freaks. Call home often, so any director trying to breathe new life into the genre to find something special to impress. With Barricade Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist by transplanting the action into the Black Forest and giving him the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody but completely unoriginal effort, made almost unsurpassable thanks to some terrible management decisions, especially through the uninterrupted use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. Timo Rose did not go for every trick his editing software offered, and Barricade would have been a pretty entertaining gore feast: his inexperienced occupiers are doing reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably the gastric vertebrae; and there is one or two scares and even some well thought out scary moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awesome camera work, the choppy editing and the overwhelming splash of visual gimmicks that make the film look as desperate as it is inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers /> I'll give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the fancy Gore, which includes a nice scene where a man is forced to drink acid, unpleasant wounds caused by a variety of sharp tools, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.
