I have just seen this movie and what a waste of time. The movie was predictable and slow. Basically, it's the bad news of the Mormons playing basketball-sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have had a root canal. The cameo appearances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. This film had potential due to the outrageous behavior that Mormons show when they play church-approved basketball. However, since she is classified as a PG, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transferred to the film. Acting is horrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.
