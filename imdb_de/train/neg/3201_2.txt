Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... He was fine in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond Villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in several other films. One thing he can not do is to star in a movie he plays in this extremely bad revenge movie in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so he kills the murderer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some people cause the plane to settle in Malta, and the killer escapes. The rest of the movie sees Joe Don chasing the murderer here and there, Joe Don has been remanded several times, Joe Don is torturing a bartender and is being interrupted and so on. The movie is pretty bad and you will not really care about Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how often Joe Don the hero is taken out in one fell swoop and how unable he is. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer in a priestly robe with the killer across Malta, then gets into boats and chases them all over Malta. This movie also contains one of the worst finishes to finish a movie.
