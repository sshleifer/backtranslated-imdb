I just do not understand some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable and that there is something so ugly that would drive you crazy. Someone here remarked that maybe it's the frequency of light waves or something else than ugliness. Miranda is just an idiot. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talkative. I also do not quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does not the Federation simply abandon the damn Medusans? I like it when Kolos talks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. All in all, I love TOS and even if it's the lameest, I'll always turn myself on. This episode though - mmm, I would not buy it except for a used copy under $ 3.
