This movie had promised so much. I was very excited about this movie. In the end it was ridiculous at best, in the worst case painful. The acting styles ranged from really, really flat (the angels, the wife and the daughter) to overly animated (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to convey information to the audience instead of trying to talk to real people. Pay special attention to the scene in relation to "the error". It's an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out. In defense of this scene, however, the biggest laugh of the entire film was achieved. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to various places abroad. Too bad they did not use it. I did not feel transported to exotic locations. Anyone could insert footage from the Coliseum in Rome. In the end, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics displayed on the decoding computers. I think (and that's all) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much lower and the ACTION factor greatly increased, this movie would be good.
