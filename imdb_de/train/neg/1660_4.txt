EXTREMITIES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman turns the tables into a would-be rapist when putting on a horse attack her house and must decide whether to kill him or inform the police. In this case, he could be released and attack her again. <br /> <br /> Exploitation fans who can expect another rude 'n' Ready Rape Fantasy in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN (1978) is almost certainly disappointed by EXTREMITIES. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two unpleasantly long attacks before gaining the upper hand of her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but screenwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take up these unpleasant scenes before they do reveal the dilemma informs the moral core of this production. Would your final solution be before a court? Maybe ... <br /> <br /> Based on a stage play that reportedly struck and injured the actors after each performance, the film makes no attempt to open the narrative, relying instead on a limited framework for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, although Fawcett's overly subdued performance is not effective for viewers who may depend on them to provide a place for their indignant outrage.
