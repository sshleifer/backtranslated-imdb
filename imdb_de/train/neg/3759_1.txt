Oh, where should I start? The cinematography was great. When the film started due to the initial landscape scenes, I thought I was facing a good movie. Then the cgi Bigfoot appeared. He looked like a cartoon drawing of the King of Kings of Lion King and King Kong. The credibility of the character was completely gone. Now I knew there was no Bigfoot looking for people wandering in the woods. No obvious reason, but a cheesy CGI cartoon. From then on, the whole movie was shot for me. The money they spent on the CGI they spent on a costume, like Roger Patterson. He was the best Bigfoot costume that nobody had. I'm a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan, and I was warned about this movie, but my compulsion led me to watch this movie, and I was disappointed, as the previous reviews had warned me. After reading this review, you will still say, "I have to watch Sasquatch hunters, watch Sasquatch hunters." Then you'll say why I wasted my well-earned money on such a painful, boring movie!
