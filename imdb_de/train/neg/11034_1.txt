I think New York is a big fake. I mean, their entire guidelines of this show are stupid. I enjoyed the taste better, it acts like a slut and an assembled hoe. Her mother is not of this world, I think she is the daughter of the devil. I mean, what does she think that these men already have girls, and I think once you're with her, you'll be ashamed to return to your girl. She is evil, spoiled and a big, fat fake. The show is very interesting to see how much money she gets for this horrible show, and what's going on with her mother, I thought she and New York would not get along, but now it seems she's just as fake like her crazy daughter. And where is the so-called husband, he's not a place to find him, I would not be with them either.
