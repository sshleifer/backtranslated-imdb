VERY boring, obvious, boring exorcist rip-off with a doberman with red eyes - that's the extent of the special effects in this cheaper one made for the TV. Richard Crenna is as animated as a chew toy. The dress and music of the 70s only contribute to torture. They should sleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Practically worthless MooCow says eaghhh what a stinking dog! : = 8P
