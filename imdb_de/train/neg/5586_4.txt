Man To Man strives to be a good movie: He has his heart in the right place, strives to be epic, and has a message that everyone will undoubtedly appreciate. There are also some problems with this picture. She strives so hard to be good and convey her message that the viewer sometimes has to feel unchallenged. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the images used in this image are simple - Man To Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but beats his message in his head. Joseph Fiennes illustrates this in his role: he does his best to look worried, sincerely moved, and all the other emotions you can express with the single expression of his repertoire. Add that the movie is too long and loses its speed towards the end. One might easily come to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth a look. But there are enough points to defend it: It's entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you'll leave the theater satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and is mostly successful.
