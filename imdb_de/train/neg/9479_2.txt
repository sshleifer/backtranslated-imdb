This movie seemed to be better when it was finished. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not too stiff ... but then, after about twenty minutes, there is this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient in the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and from there it just goes south. <br /> <br /> In addition, the demon is the stupidest Hellblood since the Godzilla-looking thing in Curse of the Demon. There are also some weird demon worshipers wearing masks that look like the exploding teenagers from the start of Logan's Run. In the end, the cinematography could not save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story just goes nowhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for that.
