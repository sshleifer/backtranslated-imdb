Watching Euro horror, especially in films by cult star Jess Franco, I realized that you can not expect a meaningful plot. Franco, however, has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere and the film's reputation as one of the director's best, succubus is, unfortunately, a dreadful movie. I have to admit that I saw the American cut version, which lasts about 76 minutes; But if not only the logic has been cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman hanging around; Practicing S & M and talking to trash and everything is really boring. There is no gore and the sex is boring, and most of the running time is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film. I struggled to make it to the end. I have to say that the locations look good and Franco made good use of his surreal atmosphere. but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has done some classic trash movies - but it looks like he's one for the money, and overall, I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.
