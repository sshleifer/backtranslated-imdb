This movie is similar to the piece written by Noel Coward titled "Blithe Spirit". The act of a ghost woman and a medium is strongly related to Coward's writing. I am surprised that films of this kind do not recognize the original author's concept. I notice that the public does not know that this is a knockoff, but it is sad. <br /> <br />. These films are so expensive in production. I wake up when a script is original. I even get excited when it's an innovative way to produce a previously published work. Some examples have been mentioned (eg toppers, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize films are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not pleased when the taste of the audience is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the audience is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to better produced movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer the piece.
