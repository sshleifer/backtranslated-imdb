Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I've treasured throughout their careers, and that was the only reason I chose this movie. All I can say is that I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves by making a series of irrelevant, unimaginative, and extreme kitchers (not that bad) sketches that are meant to make people laugh, but they do not. The only reason I can think is that the director was a friend, and they decided to support his film by starring. I can not imagine anything else because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me ever since. I would recommend that you avoid this movie, unless you want to pamper your opinion on the two actors.
