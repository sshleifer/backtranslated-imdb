I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo. So I was really excited when I could buy this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started: Man, this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says throughout the movie like three words (apart from that terrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same expression all over his face. And the stupid love thing in the middle, it's just incredibly amazingly predictable. I simply rewound the whole thing and exchanged the movie for something else.
