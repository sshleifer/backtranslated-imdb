The video quality is terrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The spectacle is terrible. The dialogue is painful. The lighting is bleak. The editing is ridiculous. I could go on, but it would be pointless. Snitch'd is a third-grade amateur video that is released as a feature film. This should best be accumulated in the video store bin.
