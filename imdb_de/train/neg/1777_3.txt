If you're the kind of moviegoers who like original content and intelligent excitement, then look elsewhere, kids. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... that was bad. I love it especially when Charles Tanya offers a ride home, she refuses and then you see him WALKING HOME. Where is his car? Anyway, just do not see people. I really want to be more specific, but the words escape me. Cats jump on humans. A guy who gets stabbed by corn. Cheesey joins the proverbial "Wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I'll take that back! See it for cameo by writer Stephen King as the man who owns the cemetery. He is actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King shows the best performance of the film. But other than that ... wow ... bad.
