I was recently online on a website that showed public domain movies. In her long list of films was this movie and I thought I would have to hallucinate with such an offensive title and premise. But no, that was really it. And since the movie was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it turned out to be a pornographic movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it was the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production crew, with a budget of about $ 49, was trying to make a Star Trek-style film about a very gay group traveling the galaxy, wiping out female oppression by killing all women, as she did the GDR did earth! And in any case, they were received with rejoicing and thanks by the now gay men of the earth. <br /> <br /> Subtle, that's not the case. With some of the most obscene and youthful names of characters I've ever heard, I do not think I can write them on IMDb without removing my review! Despite all the shit, it was strange to see and worth a look. But, as I said, because of the rough names and weird themes (though no nudity), it's an adult-only movie. By the way, this movie with 1001 questions asked me who would do the WHO, WHY, and who was the target audience ?! It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and possibly the most offensive!
