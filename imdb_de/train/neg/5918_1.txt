Carl Panzram lived an amazing life scribbling his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who had ever done anything selfless for him. The book "Panzram: A Diary of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came out more than a century after the death of Panzram, gives a first generation American the historical background of escaping from home to the west to go and be a cowboy, to get caught, thrown into the boy's house, getting away again and again and again thrown in jail, repeatedly tortured and sodomized. When Panzram became huge and strong, he tried to avenge his wrongs on him when he traveled to South America, Europe, and Africa, and it did not matter which people he raped, robbed, or murdered, because we're all worthless <br /> <br /> This movie throws the scrawny James Woods like the rough neck, the ass, the son of a bitch, Carl Panzram, who is a "drunk" in the movie, overly dramatic and emotional, and never mentions the joy of sodomy of men and boys. Nor does the film go into anything special about this world traveler and professional prisoner (as deprived of former President Taft or released from Oregon jail as long as he gave his word to return). In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.
