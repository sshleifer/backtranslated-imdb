I did not like this movie that much. It was not really funny and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely an enormously talented person, and although his acting was fine in this respect, it really seemed a waste for the star. I mean, there were some parts that were okay and a bit humorous, but that's about it. The only thing that drew my attention throughout this madness story was that some very good-looking women were present and that's not why I saw a movie, but in this case it was the only corner where even the slightest fall of salvation was found could be. All in all, it was a few notches under an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final query: <br /> <br /> Theater: So glad I did not waste too much money on it. <Br /> <br /> DVD purchase: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rental: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not?
