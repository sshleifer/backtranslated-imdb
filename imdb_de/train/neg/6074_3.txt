What a bad movie. I am really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with this. If you're shooting a movie that includes baseball and scenes of baseball, make the action look at least a bit realistic. Why did the crowd always get up without a reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was that? Somehow we think DeNiro has found his way onto the field in a referee uniform and that the game is even played in a raging rain ... one of the worst scenes ever seen in a sports movie. 3 out of 10 stars.
