It's 1978, and of course there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 places will be full, but less happy are so many black players on the field! This Super Bowl movie made for TV can be viewed. It's not much more, but it really surprises the cast of talented actors who pop up (for that time), especially Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, every good that Selleck brings to the screen quickly brings forth "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid story about Super Bowl bets. PJ Jackson is charged by "New York" (read mafia) for ending the game in his favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent and seems to have a flair for buying a few people here and there. But things seem to be falling apart for him. Another person, the unexpected Lainie, takes the responsibility. For a while, the mystery of the murders is not known for sure, but the last murder makes it clear that Lainie is the new antagonist. The acting is decent and the shooting is fine. At least there were no stupid typical chases of the 70s (they have their place, just not here). Just be open to past stereotypes and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
