I love seeing Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this poor excuse for a softcore porno movie is unnecessarily offensive, lacking in joke, and just serving as a vehicle for Springer self-promotion. Although it takes a short 90 minutes, the movie goes down terribly and I should have had the common sense to go out. Just cruel.
