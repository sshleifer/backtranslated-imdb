I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' in 1986 for the first time. At that time I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very similar to the book. Years later, I saw this version and was horrified. William Hurt is completely wrong as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate figure in whom William Hurt portrays him as an ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
