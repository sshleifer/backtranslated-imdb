This movie stinks. I do not think I have ever seen a movie that is so shocked. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the acting was bland. That could have been a good movie. I think it was based only on grotesque visuals. Usually I can handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like Miike had turned it to shoot it. Only a poorly executed movie. There's just nothing to entertain when you watch this movie, unless you're fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-molesting, parent and sibling abuse, and the spread of fecal matter , I think I've just sold the movie to many of you, but I was serious when I said it stinks. He has also succeeded in other films, but I think it's better to watch someone vomiting.
