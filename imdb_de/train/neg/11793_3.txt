Deep Shock plays like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature as a "villain", and a script that's full of technical, political, and meaningful language than it has to do with. <br /> <br /> I checked out the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have for their designs in these cheap-produced videos), and right away I was disappointed because creature was not on the box the one in the movie. The actors I expected due to the nature of the movie (actually quite generic and not meant to be specific). The music was typical, unthinkable action symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of the computers and the technical equipment as well as the mini-sub-design. The movie even went very well, with lead screens that let you know which set you are playing the story in. But there is no big story here anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 star IMO. The boring search and destruction mission to blow up the North Pole and those creatures that protect it ... somehow lame. Even Lamer is the tethered love affair between two of the characters you do not see coming. Chalk this up to a movie that seeks to bring the actors' careers from the bank into a video. Do not bother.
