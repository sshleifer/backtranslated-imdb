Despite its "independent" status, this film is a stupid Hollywood version of a disgusting mother-daughter relationship. It was not that bad in the beginning, but somewhere in the movie - at the time the daughter is dating this guy, I think - it turns out to be a cheesy mother-daughter-bonding movie. I'm sorry, but I do not know mothers who have such a relationship with their daughter ... it's probably better that way.
