When you go to an open-air cinema on the Greek summer night, you do not usually care what the movie is! Edison started really well with some good efforts from the singers who wanted to be actors, and another great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In a movie, there's usually a good start to catching the audience, done, a bit boring anyway is the story in the middle of a movie that's more about characters rather than action, and the third part is really good, so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite police officers ( packed with guns) can rip off a building) shoot at a man behind a car, do not even hit him while he kills everyone (except 3) and then the guy takes out a flamethrower (to kill the rest 3), you find out that the Greek summer sky full of stars is far too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
