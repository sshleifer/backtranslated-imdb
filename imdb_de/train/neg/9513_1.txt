I tried to watch this movie three times. I rented the night. I had about 20 minutes, hoping it would be better if I had a good night's sleep. I saw 15 more the next day and almost vomited on how stupid it was ... It was not even funny stupid, which is sometimes a funny movie, but this movie was just crap with a big S (if you know what I mean the censored world in which we live). And on the third day I finally saw the stupid thing for over an hour and never enjoyed a single moment! Not one. How did this script get greener? Oh boy! <br /> <br /> 1/10 - the one for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
