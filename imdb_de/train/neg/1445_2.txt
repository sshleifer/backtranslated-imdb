OK. No bad filmmaking, if it is an original script. BUT IT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of "In this story are there no women except Foulata and Gagoola" by Haggard, did not the producers, directors, and writers understand them? I mean, it's pretty clear English. I understood it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds: colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert, and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre producers to be involved. But no, they have to throw in "romance". Pathetic. A suggestion to all poor souls who have thought that this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe passes by and "does it right," you can read the book again. By the way, there is a follow-up book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. There is background information on the history of Quatermain. It's a bit scary, but good.
