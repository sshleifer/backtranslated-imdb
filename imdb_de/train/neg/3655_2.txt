Oh my god, I think that's maybe the kindest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate B-movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's too much mainstream. I got this on VHS from a trash can with ex-rental videos in my local video store. If I may quote the blurb: "In the 17th century, a samurai lived in Japan who would set that era for all time, his name was Mayeda, he is sent on an epic journey through the world to receive 5,000 muskets from the King of Spain Mayeda must fight against all odds to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. "Then it says" A multi-million dollar action epic across three continents. " <br /> <br /> I must have seen another movie. This was not an epic event, and it certainly was nothing on the order of millions of dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' are really just the crazy adventures of the Engrish-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He's not really a shogun, but that's not important. Importantly, he does make a really cool impression of John Cleese's repeated attacks on the one castle in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and of his ability to go from serious scenes to showing his samurai mental powers. Awesome. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is the engrish accent of Sho Kosugi. The movie lacks almost everything that makes a good movie, but makes up for it with some of the kindest lines of all time, delivered with the coolest Engrish accent ever. And honestly, do you really want something else? You could rewind 'Shogun Mayeda' to the end and repeat the last line of Kosugi again and again. The band is likely to wear out before you get tired of this one line. Great. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very cheesy.
