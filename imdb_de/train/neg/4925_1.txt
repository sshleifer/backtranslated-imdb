Please do not waste time. This film features the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (Rock Music and Stupid Biblical References) and Blade (High Tech Toy). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many that are very good. But not this stinker. Not even the soundtrack helps, mostly because the film uses ridiculously frightening classical music rather than the "kick-ass-metal" that some have reported. I only heard metal a few times. Mostly violins were tormented. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
