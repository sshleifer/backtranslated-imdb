This movie should only be viewed if you try to kill yourself. I think that this film can actually cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the whiny non-hero Kevin, Amy, his brave, ungodly conservative girlfriend Kyle, a dork in red shorts who loves phone sex, Daphne, a skinny, horny girl who is supposedly "cool" and no sense for that Dressing up and her overreached friend Nick, an army recruit who can make a point of everything. No, I'm not a pervert, so the movie is REALLY going off. The movie itself is an exaggerated rip-off of the Gremlins of 1986, but you will not find a trace of gizmo anywhere. No, those hobgoblins unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin) make the wildest dreams of a human come true and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it. At some point, they end up in a strip club, revealing the biggest dream of the nerdy Amy. She wants to be a stripper! Look, I've seen this movie about MST3K, and even Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot, who made a joke of this cinematic train accident, and I still bled from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had done it. I do not give you any more action because the experience gives me the great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain. Besides, it's not like there's any action worth mentioning. You should put a general warning from the surgeon on this movie.
