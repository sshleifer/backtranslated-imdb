This film by Oscar Petersson is unique. Its uniqueness lies not in the story, since some half-hogged Hollywood production served us comparable miserable plots, but in the thorough way that full and outward Lossiness in one aspect is evenly associated with all other aspects /> <br / > The dialogue is worse than embarrassing. Rotted and vile direction are thrown into the mix. Bosnians who speak English with strong Swedish accents add an unwanted sense of humor. Uninspired lightning and camera work make the turkey movie cake the icing on the cake. As a surprise to the audience, there are some totally unmotivated slow-motion sequences that you would least expect. To make the injury even worse, the whole thing is cut off by someone who has no sense of time. <br /> <br /> The scene of the "bad guy will be fine after listening to a good man's speech" is the point It's time to dethrone Ed Wood as the worst director ever. Move over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
