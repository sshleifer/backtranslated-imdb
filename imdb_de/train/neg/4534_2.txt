The book on which this film is based has changed my life seriously. But to say that this film is a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, the directing, the cinematography and the plot were all terrible. I would never recommend this movie. I've told countless people about the book, but now I'm telling them that they definitely should not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they left out too many key components of the book. The film tried, but failed to convey a powerful and inspiring message, only diminishing the central theme of the prophecy. While I put myself in the position that had not read the book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a lot of hoaxy B.S. I am very disappointed with Redfield, how this movie has developed.
