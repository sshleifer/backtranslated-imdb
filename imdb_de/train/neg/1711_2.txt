Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy and thought it was useless fun. That's it, without the fun. This movie is really mindless, it lacks any action, character development or plot. The fundamental problem with this movie is killing and bleeding. Basically, every kill looks exactly the same. ZOmbies rip someone off. Yes, that's okay, but you also need a few original kills. I mean, it got really lame, every kill looked exactly the same, just filmed. That killed me. I love Gore, and the gore in this movie did not do anything for me. It was just boring. No action, just the same scene with another person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love being shot on video gore movies ... like redneck zombies. But I could not complain. This movie has its good points, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped with the flood, and there were over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool because they involved so many people in the world and helped. But overall that's a terrible movie.
