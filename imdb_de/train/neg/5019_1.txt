This movie was a waste of time, even on DVD borrowed. If super-fast camera shots get faster, we can just as well pay twenty dollars to go to the laundromat, get popcorn, and watch the dryer. Jet Li is so much better. One can only hope that he does not make arrangements soon to shoot another clich√©-like movie like The One. <br /> <br /> If there's a movie you should avoid, this is "The One."
