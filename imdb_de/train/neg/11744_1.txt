Now that I have fully seen this movie, I am completely confused by the adoration received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American Western", a sentence I met him more than once? Not even near. <br /> <br /> A movie trying to tell a story like this needs believable characters speaking credible dialogues, and dialogue in this film is one of the most deceptive stereotypes I've ever seen. The film can be measured in groans per minute; How often is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no one would say in real life? There are so many cases that it distracts. Cheesy lines come in waves towards you; predictable, unoriginal and often. <br /> <br /> If bad dialogue does not bother you, how about bad shootings? Few Westerns can show you the shooting contest, which is absolutely incredible as you desperately try to take the action seriously. It's fine if such shootings have a weird advantage, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone, the very staged and very stiff choreography of early shooting is just another reason to let this movie out of the list of good westerns. The last showdown triggers the director a bit in that regard, but until then I was so uninterested in the movie that he went beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Apart from these mistakes I can say that the visuals are amazing - the movie is well recorded and the settings all look good. Acting is passable, especially given what the actors were provided for. But if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - hire Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points
