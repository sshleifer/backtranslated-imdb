Ironically, the fable of Dr. Seuss, which emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas, is one of the most hyped, marketed and successful blockbusters of the Christmas season. The general core of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Christmas grinch curse is due to an incident in childhood, and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season, with the exception of Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film is a passionate, ambitious effort to capture the weirdness and emotion of Seuss 'story, but the end result is a film that staggers and never quite grabs the emotional impact of Chuck Jones' animated version. Jim Carrey is notable in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the tempo, or the unfamiliar storylines accumulated on the first plot, the transformation from bitter miser to blessed benefactor simply does not spark light. There are wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, but beyond the technical achievements there are one or two elements missing here. <br /> <br /> Succinctness? <br /> <br /> Soul? Maybe Jones did the initial adjustment in his 25-minute cartoon, which Howard did too well in a movie that lasts for three hours. Howard, Carey, and the crew are all very capable and talented, but what appears to be a winning combination is only weak and idle in the final product. If you need to see the feature-length version, borrow it with Jones's animated version as a video and you can see how bigger and shimmering is not always better. I give this movie three out of five cans of who-hash.
