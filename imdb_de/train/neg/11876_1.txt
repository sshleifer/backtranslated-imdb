I think that's almost everything I have to say. However, I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I've never seen such an armorer production, and I mean that in the truest sense of the word. Although the physical camera work, the boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, these are unfortunately not the only areas. <br /> <br /> In contrast to some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts, great characterizations and actions have been made that unfortunately has a terrible script, terrible acting and the worst of everything, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that exists for every independent movie that is distributed like Haiku Tunnel, 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers know about Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever got into distribution. I'm pretty amused about why they recorded this. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this film that expresses any intrigue is the title. The reason for this is even a disappointment. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by this movie title to watch it. I've watched a lot of movies in my time and I'm very forgiving in the cinema, but that was too much. I will never forget "Tunnel" because I have marked an important point in my life experience in the cinema. It's a pity that it's such a low point. <br /> <br />
