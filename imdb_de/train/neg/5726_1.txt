An obvious effort for the B-class to pay off at the Hostel / Saw-Buzz. My expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And yet I could disappoint at all levels. The acting is so bad that it's not even funny, the storyline is missing and the only fear was that I spent 1 hour 21 minutes watching her! I am surprised to note that 34 people received a rating of 10 stars. I can only assume that 33 of them are cast and crew. The 34th is possibly the mother of the director? - although I'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD extras include a one-hour "making of". What raises the question "Why?" (though perhaps it demonstrates what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
