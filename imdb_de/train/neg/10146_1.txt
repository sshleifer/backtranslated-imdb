"Flight Of Fury" is a shocking, but worst, boring action movie. I do not expect much from a Seagal movie. All I'm expecting is to be entertained moderately for 90 minutes with some rash action - unfortunately not this low expectation is not reached. The action scenes are rare and far apart. The plot (which is completely irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with huge storylines. The acting is really miserable, bordering on Seagal and his whispering one-performance performance, which is the best of the sad third-rated batches - I can not believe anything close to $ 12 million was spent on this terrible mess Unless 11 million dollars out of those 12 were Seagal's salary - I doubt it somehow! The only moment that interests boys or gay girls is that two seemingly nowhere hot girls create a lesbian sex scene that is completely aired with huge bangers - it's a mediocre stuff that's not different from many Michael's Dudikoff B-Movies, which I experienced 1/10
