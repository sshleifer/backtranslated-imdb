This was an above average movie, I thought, since he was on cable. I had expected something like kitschy melodrama and bad special effects, such as Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, and so on, and Ron Livingston as the hard-pressed SWAT Commander. It's good to see him revisit the same material he was so lucky with in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework, because all the scenes and recordings looked like on that day in 1997, since FX does it all 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy.
