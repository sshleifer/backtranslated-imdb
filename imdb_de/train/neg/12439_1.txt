The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest films of the 90s. The second one was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could go on with the same story, considering that Kevin was already 17 years old in 1997. So, what does the director decide? He takes a child just as annoying and makes it sick. The child is 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of burgers are these idiots? I do not really want to go into detail if you want to see this movie sad. But please, I would recommend staying away from it. It is not worth your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, do tasks, balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap! Then it is better to look at "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
