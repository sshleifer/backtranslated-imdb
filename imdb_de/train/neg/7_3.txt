This is really a new low in entertainment. Even if there are much worse movies. <br /> <br /> In the genre of the gangster / drug scene, it's hard to have a compelling storyline (not those movies, I mean, Sebastian's motives, for example, could not be a far-fetched and worn-out cliche anymore) credible attitude of character relations (this movie does not do.). Sure, Tristan moves away from his family, but why was that again? What is the deal with his father that he still has to ask permission to go out at his age? an interesting picture to ask about the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper classes. But this movie does not go in that direction. Even if there is a chance to judge by accidental setbacks. Was not he out, why is he doing it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting questions about a solid sociocritical drama (but on the other hand, this movie is simply not, because you focus on "cool" production techniques and special effects and that does not give characters a moment to think about and before) all the forcing of the story along the path where they want it, and not to pay attention that the story can breathe and develop naturally.) <br /> <br /> It would be a drama not to abuse substances and to glorify violence (would be politically incorrect these days, right?), but on the other hand, it's nothing more than a cheap action movie (there are so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who It does not completely ruin the rest of its reputation by doing what it always does. <br /> <br /> So all in all, I can not recommend it. <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
