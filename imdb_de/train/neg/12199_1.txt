-me and my sister have just watched this movie. We laughed for the deaf. Can you imagine on covers that there is a nomination for Oscar? - At first musicians mixed about 4-5 different music styles ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- Main character New Year's Eve not fit in there he looks like the Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are anything but Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. Plane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea if Rambo should jump off the plane, but he gets stuck? Rope mix 3. a girl? The best scene is when she dies. She means a lot to him. He has known her for ages? he cries for her ... oh my god samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? his dart bag is always full of arrows? I have not noticed a scene where he's collecting them - but I've seen the scene where the arrow is in the Vietnamese soldering head. This is very important. 5. How many missiles can helicopters hold ??? I saw 4 but Rambos met about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. The main part. What are the Russian special helicopters doing in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7th scene when he enters the Vietnamese camp ... his first idea was to free the refuge that stands on the tree in open space wire? maybe made only in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - use for a running man? Oh my god, you Americans really need to learn about the weapons! do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think writers have watched too many World War II films)
