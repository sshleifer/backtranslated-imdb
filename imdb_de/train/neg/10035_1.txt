Absolutely terrible movie. Absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so loud that you can not understand speech. If you really listen carefully, what they speak is actually incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The camera work is bad, the editing is not there, the background score is a headache, the plot is bad, the dialogue is incomprehensible, the acting is miserable Well, Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now looks she looks like a starving wrestler. Hell, you can lose weight, but you will not get any mercy. <br /> <br /> After watching a movie for three hours, I want to like it, but this movie would not allow me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torment, look at this.
