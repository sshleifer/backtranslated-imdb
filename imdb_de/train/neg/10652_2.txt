You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Get ready for: The safety pin killer! Right, in Killer Workout, a stupid Slasher movie, when I've ever seen one, the invisible killer sends out his (or her?) Victims with an oversized safety pin. It's a strange choice, to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film does not even try to clarify where the killer acquired something like that. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobic gym is besieged by a mad killer and everyone is suspicious. In fact, the film gives so few clues to the identity of the murderer. Everyone in the movie is a potential killer until he is killed. And since almost everyone but the killer is dead, it's really just an exclusion process. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the aerobics class continues in earnest while the entire name is killed. In fact, nothing can stop the dance. While in the next room three men are murdered, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; A character dies, but is still seen prominently in the later workouts. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called the movie "Killer Workout" rather than "Logical Workout". Cop chases, explosive tanning beds, and hundreds of exposures of women exposed to meat are thrown out for good reason. Much like the woman who had caught in the solarium, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of the killer workout. Finally, the END gratefully flashed on the screen. What happened after that? You got it, shots of the women who train. Not even the end of the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
