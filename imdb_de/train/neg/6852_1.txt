This movie is really incredible. I've seen so many cheap trash movies, especially many 'full moon' pictures, but 'Dollman' is really tough. So much comes together: the ridiculous story, the actors always on the verge of parody and the special effects! How long could I talk about her! It's a really bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you're a fan of bad movies that you have to laugh about, you need to see it. And do not miss' Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys. It is really funnier and worse.
