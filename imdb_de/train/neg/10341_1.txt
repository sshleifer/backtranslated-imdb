I borrowed this movie from the library (hard to find for good reason) solely out of curiosity. I'm a big Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is awful, not because it differs from the original novel text, but because it deviates without focus or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and lead the viewer nowhere. What about the hokey voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was completely abused. Marilyn Hassett is utterly unbelievable, as Esther Greenwood (or even 20 years old) was partly cast because of her (she was 32 during filming, the age Plath was when she died) and partly due to the fact that she can not act. Hassett is all emotion, not a craft, not a skill. The direction is mediocre; The director simply treats what's there, which is not much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is because 0 is not an option. I'm sorry, Sylvia, you have to wait for someone else to turn your fine work into something more fitting.
