There are so many things that are not right with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the first 20 minutes of the movie could have been compressed in just five or maybe ten minutes. The full movie is (mercifully) already short, but this could have been made good if you gave the Mean Lion (how did the reference to "The Wiz" miss out on it?) A little more attention and his subplot worked a little closer in the main reason. In short, the script had the germ of a good idea, but had to be reworked a lot. Second, it could have done without the gross humor. The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least it was almost a reflection - here, flatulence and urination prevail. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little overconfident. The original series had as good as the first movie, but here it is way too much. The Brendan Fraser jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other gags with the narrator, especially a few interactions at the end, also surpass the reasonable sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the CGI work could have been given a bit more attention. In the first, it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a thumb. Ideally, special effects should only tell the story of whether they are good or bad, and at least they succeed in that regard. So it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. He lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher fails only in that specific comparison - he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a big foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie, but was not here , Julie Benz as new Ursula surprised me even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were quite normal and neither good nor bad.
