I have just watched this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed. I'm not really sure why someone would do a movie like this. It was a little entertaining, but I feel that the people who did it had a lot of disagreement over what they were doing. Monday was the writer responsible; Tuesday the director; Wednesday the guy who gets the coffee; It almost looks as though they really wanted to shoot a few different films, but they only had the time and money to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Somebody else thought the acting was really good, but I would have contradicted it. If the actors could keep a clear face during the shoot, they might be better actors than I can give them. The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film looks like a mystery ... something in the nature of historical legislation or a national treasure. It starts like that, but then, out of nowhere, there's a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was this other show that was not so good ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits <br / > <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it just plays like this. There's the bad guy with pointed white hair. There is the love interest when the wind, when it first appears, actually blows through her hair. Serious. Once you know it's a Christian movie, the end is pretty easy to spot. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was done badly, especially in the opening scenes - to get your best foot forward. For the most part of the movie, it was not cruel, but at times ridiculously bad image of an old lady praying, her arms up in a dark room, while the flashing flashes - that's something you're a little embarrassed at watching the movie on.
