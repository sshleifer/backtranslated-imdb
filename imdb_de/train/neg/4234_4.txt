It's not the best-made Slasher movies ever, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame, but the killings are not that bad. To be honest, if you do not follow the bands presented in this movie, you will not find this movie as funny as those who do. I knew somebody who saw this movie and was really disappointed with the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that in his spare time he was made to touring, to make music in between and to drink with friends behind the scenes , ..it is not made to be taken seriously. It's the best punk, and with over 100 kills, most of which are extremely bloody, it's a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and be happy!
