Yeah, that's definitely up with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I've definitely seen worse ones. I think Gremlins has rated R. Well, I met Rick Sloane at a sci-fi convention where he was amazingly lecturing! It was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes smoothly and everyone has brought something in (if you want to see a crap, you should have seen what some friends and I brought with them). <br /> <br /> He seemed to be a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take this seriously and said he loved the MST3K- Version! All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think, like Mars Attacks too bad. I guess I stand for this movie and give it a 5 and betray all my comrades. I'm sorry people.
