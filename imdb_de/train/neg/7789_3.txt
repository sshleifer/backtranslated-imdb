Although the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is not exactly offensive, it is certainly feeble-minded. The title could be a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in the 1914 series), but the 1947 version with Betty Hutton would be better suited for that. This 1967 version is a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of Elvis films. Worst of all, it's not a mix of these, but more like someone stuck together out of segments so the thing jumps back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> What unit is in production is the pair of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a good game, since both do not even have the most basic acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore plays against Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin later starred in "Evil Roy Slade" against John Aston, though the talent differences between them were actually painful. In the mid-1960s, she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, so she was featured in a similar series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit. When the automaker's advertising agency replaced it with the girl "Dodge Fever," someone came up with the idea of ​​presenting it in a feature film. <br /> <br /> What story is here when Pauline grew up in the Baskerville Foundling Home, led by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Senior on "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline - not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several opportunities she must accept. George goes to seek his fortune, and 19-year-old Pauline gets a job looking after a young oil-rich prince from the Middle East. When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem, she runs away and goes from danger to danger. These include African Pygmies, a 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze them until his one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the film industry, and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is all meant to be stupid and charming, but only creates the stupid part. There is some effort to incorporate a silent movie look into the action sequences by simulating moving a camera down (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (film stock, production design, editing) is depressing 60s. Nothing here even approaches the images of Pearl White attached to a tree trunk that moves in the direction of a circular saw or tied to a railway line waiting for the approaching train. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
