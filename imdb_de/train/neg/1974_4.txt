Some people have dispersed the film because they question the plausibility of blacks in the Old West, Asians in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Grasp and read a book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen), and everyone outside the Gentile class had access to weapons. It's the second change you know. And as far as the use of modern language is concerned, none of these western people has become nostalgic about the actual language used, which is consistent with the illustrated era. The Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace, and used many words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not blame historical inaccuracies for not finding it. Be honest. Maybe you just feel uncomfortable with what you see.
