This film is about the story of Eddy mentioned in the title and his return home with old friends in a seaside community. The plot refers to the group of friends who learn that Eddy is leaving behind as a means to deal with the death of a friend in which he somehow feels responsible. However, this is irrelevant because the decisions made in production are extremely poor and are not fully realized. Screenplays do not always have to be "talkative," but they should at least support the story's evolution. Trials are being made here, such as "He's just left" or "I know you have no love in your heart". Even though the author is not sure where to go next, he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to indie-mood music. Talk about how you make an effort. If you're interested in a good movie, the guy that gives quality and substance beyond style, this is not the movie for you.
