Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover in the video library? Was it a thought for food when the author maybe tried? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average movie that had great potential and was well directed, but delivered the best performance from a confusing story without strong points, beginning and end, bad acting, and a serious killer who was overzealous in some places the cast altogether. It was a beautiful camera, with good colors, cool hi-tech material, beautiful scenery, but you did not know where it belonged and where it was. And with the feeling that we wrap it up quickly in the end. OK to see if nothing else is on TV.
