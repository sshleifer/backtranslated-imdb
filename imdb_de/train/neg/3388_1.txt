I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I did not watch the movie anymore on cable until recently and looked forward to seeing my memories alive because I loved the original show. Imagine my dismay. <br /> <br /> This is the worst translation of a Broadway show ever made. They changed history, they changed songs, they lost their soul. I expected a journey into the past, I sang to the exceptionally touching music and the mirror, In Ballet and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Not! Not only did they falsify the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the plot and added songs and plotlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not there in the original, and put "drama" where it did not was necessary. The original had enough pathos for itself. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not bother. I'm sorry I wasted my time and watered down my memories when I looked at this cuddle.
