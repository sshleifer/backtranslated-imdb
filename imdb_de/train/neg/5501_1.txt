I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and pervasive !! It was not funny at all. The audience just sat through the whole movie and did not laugh at all !!! Not even the kids laughed !! That's sad for a Disney movie !! I thought you could have found someone who plays Martian better than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And he was not funny !! I found the speech suit really stupid !!! In the original TV series, the suit does not speak and move !! In my opinion, they should not have wasted any time on this movie !! I'll give it two Thumbes down !! Truly a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
