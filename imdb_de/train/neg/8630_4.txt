I know there's more stuff in this episode besides what I'm going to discuss, and I think it has some virtues. For example, the fact that, after seeing Sun's flashbacks in "House of the Rising Sun", we got a very negative opinion about Jin, we can see Jin's side and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is one element in this story that has made me so uncomfortable that it has greatly dampened my enjoyment of the entire episode. In the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had previously been implied that Sun's father was someone who became rich through dodgy, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was even a mob boss; Mobs operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world. So it was a reasonable possibility. In this episode, however, we learn that Sun's father is indeed the boss (or executive) of a Korean automobile company, and that Jin physically attacked a government official (who was supposed to be murdered). I may be particularly sensitive because I happened to be in the Automotive industry is working, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY and racist to even point out that this is happening in Korea; These big, reputable companies like Hyundai or Kia (who have to be the model for this fictional car company because they're the only ones that really exist in reality) are working with these mafia-like methods and not like a normal car company west. It's just unbelievable That the authors would have the trouble to write something like that in the story, and that there was no uproar in Korea. It feels like "Buy American!" Propaganda that portrays foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy third world outfits.
