This movie is NOT funny. It only needs the D & D nerd stereotypes and reinforces them. All the main characters make less than 30,000 a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially retarded and they have no luck with women. The jokes are terrible and unimaginative, for example two players were beaten by a black dwarf because one of them had a KKK hood (it was his wizard costume) and the other man a John Rocker warmup (oh how funny he is a nerd, so he does not know anything about sports, you may have to be a childish high school student to find this stuff funny, bad scots are so painful to look at but obviously extremely cheap, I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D. 'Angelo, I think these are the only possibilities that hotties offer far beyond their prime.
