The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, nothing. The action sequences look more like a series of random Akshay Kumar thumbs-up ads. Heavily influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I did not live up to expectations, but watching this movie is an annoying experience that makes you ask, "What did these people think? !! !!". <br /> <br /> The only thing you can remember after watching is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I'm not rating '1' every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood proves I'm wrong.
