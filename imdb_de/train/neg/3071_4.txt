I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (luckily), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets for the preview for free, but it was still not worth my time or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like old people have a past before they get old (no joke). The life of the main characters was painful to watch, one generation was no better than the other to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors with a lame story did the best they could. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I write this review to counteract the positive reviews that have unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
