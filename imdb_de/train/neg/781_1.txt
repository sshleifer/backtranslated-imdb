This show was absolutely terrible. For one thing, George is not funny, and his kids are little playful brats. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Hispanic I am very offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed. <br /> <br /> Also, the family dysfunctional thing has been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have made it millions of times? I thought ABC would come to their senses and pull that piece of garbage out of the air, but unfortunately we have to take advantage of that until they "jump the shark". <br /> <br /> they have already done it
