When thinking about captivity, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, indefinite, unobtrusive, unsexy, unfathomable and unsurpassed. I hated those movies from the mid to late nineties, which were really rip-offs of Scream, but these new Saw-Knockoffs start to make these movies look like classics. They still play the same demographic role in which these other films have been so successful, but now they are adding a new level of degeneration that makes the twelve to fourteen-year-old girls they aspire to feel like hardcore AND Hip. <br /> This movie is a boring crap! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name is tied to nothing good since 1993! Still, I was still surprised to see that he had something to do with THIS bad thing! Was anyone surprised when it turned out that the love interest of the film was one of psychopaths? Did not someone know when they saw him for the first time? Only someone who has never seen another movie in his life!
