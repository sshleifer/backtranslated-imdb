But my friends and I have seen the movie solely because of its title. It's cute, albeit obviously in action and direction - you know where the movie goes in the first five minutes. My main contradiction in the plot is that while it remains fairly consistent, it never explains many of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic, a retired mother, a stressed sister ... that's a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of the sister, there's no solution. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles ... it seemed pretty coincidental. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary matter ... the kids were not bad actors, but their script has left a lot to be desired Unfortunately, something that could have been a cute niche movie turned out to be a single, pale special effect , lame scripting and an obvious obvious action pushed aside.
