Okay, what kind of TRASH have I seen now? "The Witches' Mountain" has to be one of the most incoherent and craziest Spanish exploitation stripes ever, and at the same time, it's strangely captivating. There's absolutely nothing useful here, and I even doubt there was ever a script I could work with, but somehow I could not turn it off. The scratching of the head with confusion immediately begins with an opening sequence about an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. You think this movie is about kids being possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this intro the girl and her malice are simply not mentioned anymore. Then cut to a man with the most impressive mustache you'll ever see, who separates in a subtle way from his girlfriend. When she asks him to spend his holidays with her, he immediately calls his employer and asks him for some kind of assignment! Great move. The movie finally begins as he travels to a remote mountain area to photograph some peaks. But only when he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! During her journey, all sorts of strange events happen. You guessed it ?? are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, everywhere loud music sounds and someone even steals the jeep! Really, car-witches? Apparently, a witchcraft dumb witches own the mountains and they practice voodoo on intruders. This is as close as I describe the plot, but there is a good chance that I am far away? More important here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is sometimes very scary with its scary music and interesting cinematography. The supporting characters all look weird and the gorgeous Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the type of European horror film that could be legendary if only someone had written a structured script.
