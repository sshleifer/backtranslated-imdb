This should again be titled "The Curious Case of Unscrupulous Filmmakers Who Misrepresented a Non-Horror Snorer as a Shock Movie." It's a long, boring tale of fraternal confusion, a gag so transparent that even flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the payroll phase, can be dropped if he takes any job he could get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who used to perform for such cinematic heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once on tape, but unfortunately not on DVD. Misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else.
