It was really that bad. On a par with the (merciful!) Short-lived Dirty Dozen TV series, starring Ben Murphy and filmed around the same time (also on cheap in Yugoslavia) for the cast of the film - and especially for Telly Savalas. He was too old for Waaaaaay and too fat for the role (he squeezed 70 when he made this junk), and the reviewer, who draws parallels with Telly the Greek and John Wayne in The Green Berets, sums it up. > <br /> Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many ridiculous howlers that contain this celluloid crime, so I will not repeat them here. But I must add that I am amazed that nobody mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet Savalas wears on his big, bloated head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that this train accident of a movie here at IMDb has a rating of 4.7. <br /> <br /> For me it's a "1" across the bank. If you are looking for a good example of why it is really a bad idea to beat a franchise to death (especially more than 20 years after the original) - look for "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Terrible - avoid it !!!!
