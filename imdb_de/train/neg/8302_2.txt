Funny, as a studio says, it could be a continuation of a classic Christmas story with a whole new cast and assume that it will float. Sure, they used different actors for Batman, but in this case Batman was a classic character before one of the actors put on his cape. In this case, you had a classic figure in the blonde horn-rimmed glasses with Ralphy, who wanted a red ryder bb weapon at Christmas ... Somehow we should forget him and accept another little boy who bears no resemblance to the original. If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have guessed it from the cast ... unless, of course, Charles Grodin tries to imitate Darrin McGavin so much that you are constantly reminded that the original was much better br /> <br /> In the end, it might work if they had taken the movie better. They searched for similar tastes or simply ignored the original and did not try to copy their appearance. This is just a cheap imitation. The Ralphy does not evoke any sympathy, just the desire that his character shoot his eye out or die.
