"This could mean the end of the white race!" a general snatches, while a dozen native zombies wander the battlefields of Europe during the "Great War." An expedition sets off to the long-lost, back-town of Kennif-Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people slaughtering each other in their tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this movie because the acting is so wooden. Even after 1936, the behavior in this film is bad. From an earlier decade. It looks like it came from a long-distance school textbook on 'How to Act'. <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter 3: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to be scared express and abhor (female) Press both fists together, put fist of one hand on the heart, open mouth to scream, other fist, palm off, hold the pose 10 seconds longer than comfortable, then turn the head quickly 90 Degrees from the direction of the despicable object and sob ". <br /> <br /> "How do you have difficult, emotionally charged scenes with ex-fiancee Explain your love for someone else DO NOT take eye contact Do not move Do not show emotion Move your eyes Not too much while reading your lines on the wall of the studio. "<br /> <br /> In order to take a break from the leaden actors, the director cunningly interrupts long pauses in which not much happens except that the movie goes through the projectors constantly. The 35-minute story is filled up to 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The uprising of zombies when it comes to it is so slow! Freed from the mental bond, the armies of former zombie-crafters become their former masters, slowly strolling up the hill, stinging a door a bit and smashing a window. "Yeah ... let's ... oh, I do not know, yeah, let him get grief Frankenstein needs to be destroyed - Manana." (although I've just found a bit of hidden imagery, Jagger is shot by a native as an ironic counterpoint to all the natives who were shot by the Germans at the beginning of the strip.) See, even native natives do not want that to end the White Race!) The chase (so you can call it that) by the receding swamp is hilarious and worth the price alone. Roy D'Arcy has spent a hell of a while camping him, but as Colonel Mazovia he's wasted. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moment in this film. A nice little montage of the zombie natives and white members of the cast who fall under the evil eye. Face to face, blend into each other. It works, though a strange little blip in the middle of each area is like cutting a frame. I think these must be the frames of Neg Cutters between the fades. <br /> <br /> Best seen with friends and in a stupid mood.
