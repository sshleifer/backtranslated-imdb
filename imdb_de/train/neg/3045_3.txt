Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Walgreens for a big, whole dollar. I'm still not sure if it's a well-invested dollar or a foolishly wasted dollar. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing sets and costumes. Apparently, much thought and effort was invested in their production. The sets are very Mexican in style. I really liked her. And Santa Claus is impressive. One of the more impressive Santa Clauses in the movie. <br /> <br /> I guess the original purpose and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and fun for a kids audience. But somehow it gets pretty mixed up. I'm stunned how confused it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it so crazy and bizarre. One of the reasons I prefer to present movies in the original language in which they were made, and the use of English subtitles as a synchronization often leads to an unwanted strangeness. The children's voices were at least titled with real children's voices, as opposed to women pretending to be kids, which sounds very, very funny ballet in their longjohns? Do not you have me either, until I see this movie? You learn something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth it? Well, that's a job. I can not recommend it to a clear conscience, as it is quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. Nevertheless, it is the unwanted bizarre that is worth seeing. You decide what you will do. I do not know ... I found it uncomfortable for me to see demons constantly making ballet moves. Well, that's just wrong ...
