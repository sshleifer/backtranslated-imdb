(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks thinks when they decided to spend $ 80 million on this extremely tired and lame animated film. They probably thought the spectacular animation was more than enough to see crowds (mostly families) in droves. Well, it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it was about $ 26 million, about $ 38.1 million. totally (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the viewers who came over the weekend saw pretty much the same thing when I saw it and spread it. This is a mostly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seems to be done by a three year old. <br /> <br /> The movie is only about 80 minutes long. long, but it feels like a three-hour epic. A few sticking points for me are: Well, the irritating narrative is one of them, and it's so obviously written. Once he escapes a few conquerors and although the horse is obviously scared, the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) leaps open to dispel misunderstandings (which would only be the case with the simplest mindset.) <br /> Another is the constant pop-up of Bryan Adams songs Now I'm a fan of his music I think he's good, but Dreamworks really believed the audience could handle 8-9 From his songs in such a short movie I could After all, here's a spoiler, a horse being shot up close by a member of the Calvary, Spirit (the focus of the movie) trying to rescue them, but both go well over a waterfall that has to drop at least 50 feet Later in the movie, in the end, we see that this horse is alive and healthy. I know this is a children's movie, but even this small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In summary This is a really lame movie vie, I'm not saying children will not enjoy it, but everyone else will only wait their watches when he waits for this trip to end. Definitely on my top 10 worst list this year. - ** of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
