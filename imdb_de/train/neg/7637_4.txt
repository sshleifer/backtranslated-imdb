That could have been a very good movie if I had seen him. The handheld camera was very posable. I was worried about the opening credits. Some of us saw that in the end it got really bad. But we stayed here until the end, because it was such a charming and interesting movie that provided insight into young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film underlines the artful feeling. The drama seemed very authentic. Some dialogues were a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. However, if you have a travel sickness, you might seriously consider skipping this movie. It's quaint, but not worth the nausea.
