When films like ghoulies demolish Gremlins, hobgoblins sink to the new low of tearing garbage like ghoulies. These barely animated furbies have some sort of fantasy-fulfilling plan (which basically involves grotesque sexual dreams of the characters - oh, joy), but what has to do with that is anyone's guess, unless the director enjoys his kinky eroticism. They show this in the eighth circle of hell, one supposes. There is no real conspiracy - just "goblins - kill!" and weak attempts of humor and a mild attempt to excite the audience audience.
