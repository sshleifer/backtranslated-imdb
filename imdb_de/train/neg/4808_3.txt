Ok, I've seen a lot of movies about witches and occultism, but this movie was just funny. This movie begins as the Witchcraft cult, led by a really bad Orson Wells starring (if he could not have had someone who looked rather like a satanist and behaved). He just did not belong to this movie. Nevertheless, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles someone and causes them to miscarry. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband had to go to a place called Lillith for business reasons, and the woman now sees a picture of her sister or whoever she calls, and warns her to stay away from it and never to use her powers there or she will die. After settling in the strange city, the couple realizes that all residents are witches and they become curious and afraid of their neighbors and friends. Then strange things happen when the lady discovers a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (that was scary), and when he saw the little boy from Orson Wells at the playground, whom he later asks of the lady, to him Help to Life The lady soon tries to escape the city, but only to find herself trapped by her inhabitants and powers, and she ignores everything the ghost tries to warn her about. This movie is alright, it has moments of suspense, but it could have been really better than having Orson with it.
