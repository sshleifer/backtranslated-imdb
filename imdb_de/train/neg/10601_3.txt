This is the official sequel to the action thriller '92. Originally, Van Damme had been recaptured among several veteran veterans of the Vietnam War to be the perfect soldier (Unisols). I think it's about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter of that age. Now he is working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols codenamed Unisol 2500 for some reason. As usual, something goes awry: The supercomputer on site (called Seth - like the snake in "King Cobra" in the same year) is completely crazy, takes control of the Unisols and even loads his computer brain into a new Super Unisol body ( Jai White). We're looking at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's struggles are linked to a particularly mean Unisol (Pro-Wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps coming up: Drop him from a building - no good; Guide him down in a truck - no! Shoot him, burn him - do not forget! Much of the humor is due to the fact that Van Damme is now outdated and superior (he even gets gray on the edges). But even though he licks, he occurs anyway! Most sequels of this kind are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals, and while this is certainly not a stroke of genius, he manages to be entertaining throughout, especially if you're a wrestling fan.
