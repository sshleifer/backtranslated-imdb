Parasomnia has an interesting premise, but the story is made bad without tensions or logical approaches. The cast was not convincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a major role in such films as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Jeffrey Combs, is unknown (and not very good). (Herbert West from the great re-animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in sleep (which he does a bit here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all. The story is pretty boring and predictable with cheap computer effects, mixed with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> That could have been so much better, I can not get any good reviews on this movie. It is really below average.
