I think I've seen something like this before: college graduates do not know that they're damned good and complain that their lives are shit and reality bites of what I can do with them: they have virtually the same story , <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this snore party, it was the music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As for me, I'm not impressed ... but on the other hand, I never expected anything less. This movie was directed by the same person as Batman and Robin. Another movie that should only be seen with a blindfold in tow. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it's one of ten points.
