OK. I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson in it. When my children decided to see this movie, I decided to join. I wish I had stayed home instead and watched the TV program. <br /> <br /> The fact that the humor is stupid and unoriginal is the least problem with this movie. The plot is virtually non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and worst of all, Gadget has no lesson at all. It seems Disney took away all the things Inspector Gadget got on TV and threw them all. To be honest, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie, but the older one (10 years old) thought it stupid (he was too old for the youth humor, but too young for the adult tumor) br /> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies, but this movie is missing by a mile. It's fine for a very tight age group (about 7 to 9 years), but a must for everyone else.
