This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible spectacle, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far removed from the legend of Robin Hood that it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented to me that you would love this show if you had any imagination. This is a terrible approach to a television series. A visual medium like this should stimulate your imagination, you should not have to force your imagination to do it well. It would be like the Simpsons episode trying to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and he starts talking about who killed who or what. "When a movie is boring, I just pick up my own story." <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Absolute human waste.
