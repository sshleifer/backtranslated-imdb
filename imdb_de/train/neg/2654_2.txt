Although the casting for this film, notably Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, was admirable, the quality of the lyrics was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make the film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that we saw the entire movie because it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn away. We may have "hoped" that the message would eventually be felt and that we could find meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience was able to "understand" this intricate story, a merit of the ingenuity of the human brain to understand the absurd. However, the authors did NOTHING to promote this innate need that we seem to have for searching for meaning. It was obvious that the participants merely went through the movements of their respective craft and any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TV movies have evolved over the years. While the transmission of a message to the public may have been the authors' main interest in the past, today's authors and producers seem condescending to their audiences, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "stick to it" through the incessant advertising The only reason why films like Surrender, Dorothy are made.
