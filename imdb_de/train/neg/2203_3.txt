Note to all mad scientists everywhere: If you turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you have to give him a scary name as "Paul." I do not care if he's a scary hammerhead, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and the ability to invade people both in the water and on the dry land. Give the child a more worthy name, such as "Thor," "Rock," or "Tiburon." Because even if he eats me, I'll probably just sit there and laugh: "Ha! Get a load! Paul the Monster tears me to shreds !!!!!" The worst thing about this movie is that this shark thing is called "Paul" throughout the movie. What a decent, scary horror movie could have done seems stupid. Not that there are no other camping and engineered parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". The scientists spend the entire movie on this island, and suddenly one of the girls is itching that she's been running through the lush forest, and she just has to put water on her feet to relieve the itching, which of course "Paul" allows "Getting out of the water and killing them ... The only thing SciFI Channel did right in this movie was that the hottie lives live, but that's a little silver foundation in an otherwise disappointing movie.
