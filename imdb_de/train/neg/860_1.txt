Kubrick meets king. In the spring of 1980, it sounded as promising as I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have since quarreled with the King cultists. The king-cultists say Stanley Kubrick has taken a big horror story and ruined it. The Kubrick cultists do not care about King's story. They talk about steadicams, tracking shots, and camera angles. This is a movie, they insist: It should be considered by itself. Anyway, both camps are right. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If you look at it just as an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits. <br /> <br /> I accused that of Kubrick's scriptwriter in particular. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a writer of social manners. Perhaps she was chosen for her subtle understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small industrial town of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map of its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick, the Anglophile, probably liked her. He is of course the true author. His screenplay for "The Shining" - with its mish-mash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation - does not support logical analysis for its own merits. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to see Kubrick's "shining" under his own conditions. I'm even ready to regard it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie. But as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and insanity, it does not succeed. Either way, the movie breaks pretty much. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel really? Or do they exist only in the head - first as the premature nightmares of little Danny Torrance, then as hallucinations of his father? You notice, as always, when Jack Torrance speaks with a "ghost," he actually looks in a mirror. You can see how the frozen labyrinth of the hotel's hedgerow half symbolizes stunted, confused psyche. Very deep stuff. <br /> <br /> But if the "ghosts" of the Overlook are indeed pure manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing madness, who would then let the captured Jack out of the dead cupboard of the hotel kitchen so that he can perform his fast swinging ax? <br /> <br /> And EVERYONE with a straight face can explain Nicholson's black and white photography (helpful "1921") as a tuxedo party - a gait that emerges from the left field during the final seconds of the movie a ballroom wall falls? Do we have to seriously assume that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness is due to a kind of "past life experience"? (And if you swallow that, since when should reincarnated be exact physical replicas of their former selves?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick did not care about his plot. Maybe I just wanted to create a horrible mood. Anyway, the movie tries to hedge its narrative bets - both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This film has not improved with age, and with repeated visits, it certainly will not be improved. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia and general horror are spread over this long time, long movie. But those bubbling Elevators o 'Blood, seen again and again in little Danny's visions, are absurd and ridiculous. And Jack Torrances infamous marker lines ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Just pierce the dramatic suspense of the movie and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comical relief: "Phew! I'm glad we do not have to take this seriously!") After all, Kubrick is completely at sea - or completely cynical - during the scenes, in Wendy walks through the empty hotel while her husband attempts to pur√©e her son. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting dead in their party hats? Yes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he provided exactly the kind of eyeball rolls, eyebrow wobbling and scenery-chomping achievements that the director was looking for The performance of Shelley Duvall as a kind of female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" is best passed on in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie just fails - not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably deserves a 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it was overrated in this forum so GROTESQUELY.
