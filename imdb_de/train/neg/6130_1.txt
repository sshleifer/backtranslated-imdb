In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Men in his position are inevitably offered film roles that only serve to capitalize on them. I have no idea what Thomas paid for this film, but I would have to get a lot of money to agree that I would be a fool in a movie. The movie is obviously derived from "Enter The Dragon," like most martial arts images. Instead of a real martial art, they brew an absurd new martial art, which is described by a critic as exactly "cross between kung fu and breakdance". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue a lady from an impenetrable fortress, but in every room there is a prop that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant villains. Of course, he fights for the main rogue, and of course they have a fancy fight with an end that will only surprise those who have never seen a Marshal Arts movie. There are touches that nostalgic types will like, especially the mullet of Thomas and many of the male stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he had never entered the movie set.
