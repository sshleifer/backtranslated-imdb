SCARECROWS seems to be a mock horror that meets a supernatural movie. A group of thugs pulls out a paramilitary robbery at Camp Pendleton in California. They abduct a cargo plane and kidnap the pilot and his daughter with the demand to be flown to Mexico. Along the way, a greedy robber decides to land with the money in a cornfield overseen by strange-looking scarecrows. These are not ordinary scarecrows ... they can kill. Acting is no better than the terrible dialogue. And the attempts of humor are not funny. Very low budget and completely turned on in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
