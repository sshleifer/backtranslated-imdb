I do not want to cheer up here, but ..... that's the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent governance, disjunctive writing and terrible acting are the only consistent elements. Shot on very cheap videos, it looks like a project at a high school, but without the emotions. The lighting often looks like a single sun gun. The sound is slightly better than a single microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot goes in strange directions without foundation or later dissolution, the technical elements are obviously absurd and the editing seems worse than a rough cut. It's not bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. By the way, the packaging is deliberately misleading. Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
