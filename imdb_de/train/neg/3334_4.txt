That scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it rather amusing than scary, but with some pretty disturbing moments and a kind of bad quality that I like. And considering, the plot is actually pretty disgusting ... but treated with a little taste. If there is a problem with this movie, there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. The end also lasts forever and makes a possibly tense climax appear silly after a while, with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "Monster" is unfortunately not very scary after his exposure. The slightly bleak look of the film also works against it and makes it more than a television movie as something made for theater. But it's an example of films that are rarely made these days, so I encourage horror fans to look at them and be a bit nostalgic ...
