The woman wants the husband to invest some money of the deceased mother in the father's business. However, Father is known to lose money on hair brain systems. Nobody knows anything, but really evil intriguers pose as Man's best friends to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> The production is appealing, but the story fails. The players do not play well. Notable as the first appearance of Broderick Crawford - as Gopher "Hunk"; Apart from errands, Mr. Crawford is being pinned down by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Woman Chases Man (4/28/37) John G.
