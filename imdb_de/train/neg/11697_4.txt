I'm not one of those who think that King is a great writer. His books are good distractions for a few hours and often have interesting prerequisites, but in my opinion they diverge pretty quickly if you think about it seriously. <br /> This film suffers from a fairly accurate retelling of King's story. If you've read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes to scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there's nothing terrible about the movie, it's a gypsy curse horror whose transformation is the bane. Many want to get thinner. The last third has some serious structural issues, and the slightly forced end seems to hurt the rules of the genre somewhat. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you could also read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
