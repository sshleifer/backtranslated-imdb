I've tried to end this movie three times, but it's terrible. A typical example: mother and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast, mother stops for gasoline, crazy gas stations that are crazy about her husband whose running the B & B tries to rape her. She escapes, goes to B & B and instead of making her husband ballistic and she wants to call the police, the story goes on with lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other deficits of action logic abound. The action is also lukewarm, and the neighbor's warning is spent in a really crazy, bad-looking moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense blood / death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of a time-consuming interplay between characters. <Less focus on Gore, more focus on mood and history would have been appreciated.
