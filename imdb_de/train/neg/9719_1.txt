Um, please forgive me, but did not more than half of the characters be missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man who was imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying to escape several times. He breaks the parole and is tirelessly persecuted by the police inspector Javert. Along the way there are many characters that were not in this version. Some noteworthy would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme, Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to see how it was somehow related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
