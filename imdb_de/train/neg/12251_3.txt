Oh, CGI. A blessing if used properly. A sin used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, that's not the only thing badly used in this countless Jaws rip-off. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyone who has read a number of my posted reviews has probably noticed two things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If in the low budget movie is a sweet guy, I'll usually point that out. Well, let's just get that out of the way now. This is a low budget horror movie that I did not like. Acting is mostly awful, looks ridiculous, and the script can think of Battlefield Earth as the worst I've experienced this year. As for the local sweet boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) undoubtedly wins this award. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he's not just a well-toned body with beautiful eyes and a cute butt ... he can actually act (as much as he can in this vile movie). Now that we've done the housework, we'll move on. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to give away anything) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island to to film a documentary about two surfers (established cute boy and his buddy) surfing with sharks. They are unaware that a fairly large saltwater crocodile lurks around the island. Croc appears, chaos arises and people are eaten. Roll End Credits. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is pretty good. It started pretty well, but soon became stupid and stupid. A main character gets to have lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heroes utter one-liners at the sacrifice's cost. Although this crocodile is at the top of the food chain on land and in the water, what about all sharks? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think a few sparse sharks would stand around. The FX is one of the worst I've ever seen. The CGI is terrible, and they even managed to confuse the animatronic crocodiles. Attention, filmmaker. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter You know what crocodiles look like. You obviously did not mention any of them when you judge the monstrosity at the end of the movie. And what about the pirate / drug gang? Need some other reason to tear down the top of a woman? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small undergenres in the movie world. With Alligator and his sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it now looks like "oversized crocodile / alligator" movies are now getting their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
