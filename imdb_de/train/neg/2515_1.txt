This film is an abomination and its creation should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of filmmaking is why no one has ever made a faithful adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story of a really gripping mystery, a beautiful old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the creators have to turn Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman into an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change the main plot on the murder charges and circumstances of Gordon's fight for the accused, etc., etc.? Those producers and directors, who always think they can write a better story than those in the book, should write the original and not rape someone else's product.
