When his parents-in-law are brutally murdered by a thug gang, a young deputy is ordered to accompany his dumb friend, who is forced by the gang to take the rap, to Tucson to be tried and face the real killers <br /> <br /> The Decoy is a real bait that is sent to video stores to lure you of better movies! It is unconventional, illogical, slow and ultimately very boring. <br /> <br /> There are some good costumes, sets and photography, but nothing else is on this vanity writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink project, who apparently had too much money in their hands. <br /> <br /> They made westerns like these that were less than an hour long. Cut this to about half the length and you may have something to see.
