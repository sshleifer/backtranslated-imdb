Of all the movies (and I'm a movie graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is the BAD movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones I have not seen, but I saw that, and that's the worst thing. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about young and retarded. She is not in the credits! Her role was incredibly small! How did she make it onto the cover? IMDb does not even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad that we wrote a short message to the video store when we brought it back and put it in the suitcase. It read something like "Please save your other customers from viewing this complete and totally bad movie!"
