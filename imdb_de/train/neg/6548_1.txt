If you look at this without any idea of ​​what the story is about, you'll be surprised. Even then, the abstract has painted a picture of a rather sensible plot, but the actual movie is anything but. <br /> <br /> As the resume went, she tells of an obsessed mountaineer you will see as a prologue to the opening credo and text crawls that tell about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that lives in dreamy manuscripts of the mind exists (note to yourself - this means trouble with flashing lights), after which the residents crave a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and notice all the people of this mountaineer, and the synopsis explained that they had decided to contact him through alchemy to create a smart sphere that would hit the man. <br /> <br /> is a repetitive animation that a 5 year old child could produce. Made shapes, even though the stop-motion style is credited, and goes through a mental loop. Repeat this process until your eyes close and proceed to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if that term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing with this magical sphere, and having a field day to play with before being released into the "other" world. It also does not get better if the man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotic boring and sleep-inducing sequence. Thank God, of course, the duration is shorter than the displayed time (57 minutes) (or less) against the 70 mentioned. Although they are obsolete, the dull colors, the nonexistent story, the scratchy soundtrack and the repetitive images do not convince. Do not waste time.
