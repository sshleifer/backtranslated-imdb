This movie is probably Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film he seems to be a Muslim, because he has a hat, that he has kept his amulet and his general clothing. He has a six-year-old child wearing the same headgear and therefore probably a Muslim, even though the mother is a Christian. The main character decides thus for a Muslim and his child becomes Muslim. None of the other male protagonists who are Christians seem to be raising a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie in the end, it seems.
