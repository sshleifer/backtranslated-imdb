Superhero movies are always shitty, and that's no exception. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the movie could be even worse. I would put "Batman & Robin" and "Steel" over this movie, so it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, look at 'Blankman' , serious "superhero movie", but at least entertaining.
