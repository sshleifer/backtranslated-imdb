A Christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. Of course I was thrilled when this movie came out in 1994. I saw the opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself. I am risen and corrupted. The expectation that the rank in a Christmas story is true is strangely missing from this mess. A Red Ryder BB Gun is better than getting a Chinese top. And it's not very funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but the dollar stops there. Conclusion: 1 star. Do not even bother.
