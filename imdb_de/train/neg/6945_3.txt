Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his child killed and his wife is viciously attacked in a house invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him with post-traumatic stress. Then Archer is confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) who is tied up and gagged to a chair. He is told that this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife, and he can do whatever he wants with him. And there's a wide variety of instruments to help him out ... <br /> <br /> Film is initially interesting (and shows real reluctance in terms of blood and blood) but is duller by the minute highly unlikely twists and turns. It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that someone would actually remember to use it. How such talented actors as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer were involved in such a crap is incomprehensible to me. This brings three stars to acting, but the stupid conspiracy and really incredible twists make this a chore.
