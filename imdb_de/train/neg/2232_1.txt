I took a look ... let me rewrite ... suffered because I'm a fan of Eva. I do not think this is a movie she puts on the back of her photos. I like Gangsta Flix, but that was not so close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and the money was probably spent on the caterer. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you got the chance to take care of it or not. <br /> <br /> I will not say who did what and how, because it is not worth the effort. I am just glad that I did not have to pay for this garbage due to my monthly rental plan at the local video store. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you get involved with me, I love movies, I thought a little flix would be good that some of you have jammed, so tell me all that you need to know.
