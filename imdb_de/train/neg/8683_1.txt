This show is not smart. That's what it basically boils down to. The "original sense of humor" that these authors try to create so as not to completely bite the rest of the bush-bashing of the world is simply not funny. In another comment someone quotes some funny lines. The outstanding thing for me was George H.W. Bush tells the kids not to watch TV except Fox News. Impressive. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a highlight for the series is pitiful. <br /> <br /> My problem with this sorry apology for political satire is that these people are getting a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do that. But that's no excuse to eradicate this total waste of time. I put these authors on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula, biting off so many not-fancy current jokes as possible anyway and throwing in even worse original material to actually give write credits. <br /> <br /> Just bad. Unfunny, and it makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is being redone, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please do not look at this crap unless you are one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think every sentence is Bush and stupid comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the voice of Bush is shit. Everything he does is a Texas accent. At least South Park admits the voices are not accurate. If you want funny political satire, check out Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun as the stop motion action figure animation is made EXTREMELY good. Look for the George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube. priceless
