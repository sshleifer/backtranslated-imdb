This is one of those movies that appear like two afternoons on cable to entertain bored housewives while they iron. Action is secondary. Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleep through the whole movie. And God help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too over the top. It does not sound like a real Englishwoman. It sounds forced and spurious, much like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, a lesbian showgirl rival who plays in a rock and roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, stupid and stupid. How should we take care of these people? Once Christy Scott Cashman loses himself in Central Park. "Really?" It's not that hard to navigate through Central Park. Just follow every path. I was not just interested in any characters, I hated them too. The only reason why I stayed with this train wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Every scene is typical of a romantic comedy and nothing will surprise us. The script was as awful as acting. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
