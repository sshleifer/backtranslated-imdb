The only thing that proves "An Convenient Truth" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "undisputed" experts are undisputed, as a response to their inhumane hypotheses is usually behind the real science. This is mostly wrong scientific people. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people. We exhale. If you are not ready to sacrifice your brothers to save the world, you do not have to do anything. We have heard that the world has ended for over 50 years as a result of man. Fools publish a timeline for their doomsday and when the time is up, nothing has happened. "An Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle that an insincere faction of American society can deceive its idiot. <br /> <br /> And when Al leaves the tobacco business because of his sister's death from cancer, it's a burden too. Al could not run his farm better than the country. He lost money on the operation because he did not want to farm when he could earn more on speach tours. The only global warming that is unchallenged is the hot air that this gas bag creates!
