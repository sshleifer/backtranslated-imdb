Denzel is about the only thing that's right in this movie. Maybe this was once a better movie at an early stage. Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie and forgive most of the plot in the first 5 minutes. To ruin that and everything that has built up in the tempo and rhythm the movie had before. <br /> <br /> So first it confuses you and then it will scare you off. The dramatization pushes beyond the suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this one are able to appeal to viewers. Granted, it does so if you're looking for it ... beat yourself out.
