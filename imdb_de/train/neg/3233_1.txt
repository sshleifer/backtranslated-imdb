Come on, guys, you can not be serious, another case of copywriting if it's not! This is not even scary and not scary or spoiled - it's just a terrible amateur movie made for the next party to seduce the girls -scene is far from wanting to puke me, but I just want to just take the camera and beat those guys over the head. The girl just lies there with a rubberized face and does not move at all. It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more frightening than this. Do not waste your time or your money.
