If you look at another bad Nightmare successor like Freddy's Revenge, you must at least give him some credit for trying something new. And although "The Dream Child" is more fun, it offers absolutely nothing new in the series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, like a child becoming part of a comic and facing "Super Freddy", but even scenes like this are not used to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are just boring <br /> This was the official death of the fear of the series. Freddy now seems to be the comic relief ... but to what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
