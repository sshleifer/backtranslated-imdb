Certainly not terrible, but definitely not good. Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was staged by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). The stars are James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about South Africa before apartheid and about the stories of a black man and a white man who are intertwined. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg stating that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son killed a man. Rich farmer James Jarvis (Richard Harris) notes that his son, a black rights fighter, was killed by Kumalos son. In that they connect. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the film of the same name from 1951, because I did not see it. Or the 1974 under the title Lost in the Stars for I have not seen it either; both look better than these. But I've seen Cry Freedom on the other side; It has a much more urgent atmosphere, as if it were actually trying to say something where the film Cry, The Beloved Country has no idea where to go. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (apart from the fact that I enjoyed the novel more than the film), because novels and films are two very different media and it makes no sense to transfer them directly to the other or to compare them by the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie has blown. Well, I think it was not so bad - five out of ten - but it was not that good either. Both of the main characters, both very capable actors, are showing some of the best wood appearances I've ever seen in the most unpleasant dialogues in film history (but that can be blamed on screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely absent.) This movie, too the sublime pianist and Being Julia wrote). Among other things, the theme and themes of the novel are almost completely lost for the third time in the transition to film; If anything, there is little tension with every moment of the movie, racist or exciting. The music does not help. The painfully misguided and boring pastoral orchestral tracks really help to tone down the movie. An advantage is the cinematography with many good or great shots, but this does not help the film very much. <br /> <br /> The last, striking words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of The Movie. It's too bad that they seem so disconnected from the film that has just been shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
