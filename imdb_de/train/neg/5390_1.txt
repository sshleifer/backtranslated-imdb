Do not be wrong, this is neither a horror nor a movie. I strongly advise against viewing this 82-minute failure. The only reason it deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there is a turn, a touch of surprise, a conspiracy, but none. <br /> <br /> The characters make unpredictable turns in their actions and still attract I do not have the time to develop - thanks to the sparing editors and honestly embarrassed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable ethnic "companion". <br /> <br /> Your encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are brief, confusing and completely pointless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine struggles to stay above the surface while drowned in the misery of a light plaster. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be drier if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves through the desert of Navada. <br /> <br /> Check out 'The Road', look at '28 days later ', watch Day TV ... but all this; I implore you Boredom, contrary to what you think, believe in the movie, this movie is not a cure.
