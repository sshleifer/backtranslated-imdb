I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of this story. As a stand-alone movie, I found that very boring. The fight scenes were trying to be big and spectacular, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad and undoubtedly Brad Pitt was cast to attract the ladies. But he is not a good warrior, I fear too well. <br /> <br /> Good points are the design. This movie looks good when the scenery and the castle buildings / walls are impressive. I like a movie that at least tries to make the characters' accents come true, but this movie just seems to completely ignore it. We hear American, Scottish English anything but what you would expect for a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not recommend this movie for a family. It is too long and the boys will be bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it is OK if you are not interested in the lack of realism.
