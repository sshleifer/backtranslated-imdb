Unhinged is banned in the UK as "Video Nasty" and of course has gained some popularity. The most shocking thing about the film, however, was its amateurism in all departments. The bloodshed I could handle: The horrible drama, the modest editing, the terrible direction, the lousy script, and the miserable soundtrack were far harder to take on. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The homeowner, a horny old lady and her little daughter, welcomed the girls and allowed them to stay a few days to recover. Someone does not want the girls to go? One by one they fall victim to an unseen attacker. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is a long time to present some of the worst performances in a horror movie (and that requires something) terrible movie. The music is a total mess (it sounds like a three-year-old released on a synthesizer) and as such perfectly complements the movie. Only a few bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of unfounded nudity save Unhinged from the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you're a horror executor (and I'm sorry) then you'll want to. Watch this to remove it from the Video Nasty Watchlist. But be warned, it's really, very bad.
