I'm sorry, my neighbors from Nevada City, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had too much Botox because he had very little facial expression throughout the movie. Alice looked like she had a board attached to her back. She was stiff throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I looked at both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive biography of the work. I would have guessed that these are first year students. Ed Asner and Peter Jason wore the film open with their banter and lightness with each line. Ed certainly has not lost his charisma. I wish I had taken the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scenes and scenes of shops and church because I was there. I make Nevada City my home and waited anxiously for the premiere. Unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
