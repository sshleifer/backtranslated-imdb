I'm a big fan of horror movie and zombie movies are a special favorite of mine. Zombi 3 is one of the absolutely worst movies I have ever seen. It's needless to say that I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story bears some resemblance to Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead," but although the film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous acting I have ever experienced, especially from the main character of the scientist. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. In addition, the effects are below average and sloppy in many cases, and the death scenes are often just stupid. Of course that's even more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - Worst of all is the scene where the guy opens the fridge door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow gets stuck out of the fridge (obviously awkward with a string) hanging on the boys neck, killing him. Zombie heads can now float in the air? It defies any law of physics known to man, and it is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. That's just one of many really silly moments in this idiotic mess. I can not believe that it has received such a high rating here. If you're a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and hire this jerk.
