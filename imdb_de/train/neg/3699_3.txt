<br /> <br /> You'd expect a movie starring a famous comedian to be a fun movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud throughout the movie, and that was not even in the last comedy scene (which would be the funniest). This is one you can watch on TV. Do not spend any other money to rent it.
