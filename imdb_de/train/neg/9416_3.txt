Steve McQueen certainly has many loyal fans. He was certainly a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic people the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can not save that turkey of a movie taken with a brownie camera at the actual locations in St. Louis. McQueens a new kid who has no criminal record in the planning of a bank robbery by one of the other gang. There is more than one general indication that there is a gay relationship between the young Steve and David Clarke. He is not liked by the other rape members at all, mainly because he has no criminal resume. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something on foot, especially when he starts talking to Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all rather rough characters. That would certainly arouse my suspicion. <br /> <br /> The robbery of the Great St. Louis Bank had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim mainly made documentary films, and Stix did not do much. One of the two jokers decided that Steve's achievement was best achieved through a poor Marlon Brando imitation. <br /> <br /> This film may be considered the worst movie Steve McQueen has ever made. I'm willing to bet Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed him up for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would, if they saw it. Or they might have seen something The audience would have missed the dressing for this turkey.
