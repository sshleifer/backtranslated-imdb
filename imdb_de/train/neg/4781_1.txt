This could be the worst example of amateur propaganda ever made. The authors and producers were to study the German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even a chunky Soviet-style leader as a godlike father figure was better suited. Disappointing. The loss of faith that was just regained in the church at the last minute for Dad to be "saved" by the Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few misty sky shots of the angelic Hoover in the corner of the screen - bright and nodding - would have helped a lot. The best aspect is that Hoover only rescues the deserved family and children who have "proven" themselves. Unfortunately, other poor homeless have been portrayed as sympathetic and even good - but the Hoover God does not help them. A better approach would have been to take pictures of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition. Finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover had saved the country from depression) should have finally rolled out. We could then see how Hoover God had not only earned THIS, the family, but had saved all the truly meritorious ones. Best amateur.
