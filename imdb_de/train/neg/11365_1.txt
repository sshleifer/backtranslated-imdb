This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I think they only copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers must have thought that we were making a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not make it. Now in the third week it only runs in Antwerp and Brussels at 22:45 or so. In the past we had really good movies in Belgium like Daens. Shadow is a waste of time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after seeing a real movie. If you have seen ten minutes of shades, you have seen everything. It was advertised on the local radio and television to death. I hope it will soon disappear in the shadows.
