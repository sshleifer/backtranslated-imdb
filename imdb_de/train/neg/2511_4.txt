Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-intentioned but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau), who tries to connect his scientific niece (Ryan) with the common man Tim Robbins, to make them relax and that To enjoy life in the fifties. For Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the movie falls flat with crazy situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the great supporting role are doing their best to keep this stupid comedy afloat but can not save the movie. It is unfortunate that so much talent flowed into the production of such a dull film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
