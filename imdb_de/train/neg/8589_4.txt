First of all, let me first say that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES movies. I do not read books, play games, wear underwear or eat cereal (if there is one). I'm just a fan of the movies. <br /> <br /> With that said, I'm trying to see how people praise this movie so much. I take this movie for myself and I did not compare it to its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2). I do not understand how to say that this is an amazing movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogues, fictional scenes (ie, R2 is suddenly a badass, and long CGI-intense chase scenes that have little human traits), HORRIBLE acting and notable storylines ... how's that good? There was no real inner dilemma in Anakin; It just seemed like a switch had been turned and he was suddenly angry. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes (which incidentally was ruined by the Frankenstein scene "NOOOOOO!"). If you BOMBARD the screen with extremely stunning CGI effects and fill the gaps with absolutely vile lines, if more could and should have been said, this is not a great movie. For a film with such a "dark" tone the speech of ALL characters was too high. <br /> <br /> I conclude with one question: from the beginning to the end of the film was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what would actually take place?
