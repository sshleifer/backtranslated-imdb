You should have called this movie ... Blond women who had to color their roots. Even the main character, geeze, the too tight sweater. The giggle I thought the guy did a good job. I still hope that this week we will find a good 8-star Christmas movie. The arrow throws. Also had to laugh about it. We still have three more on the DVR, maybe we're lucky. Oh yes, I figured that guy out pretty fast and nailed him when he picked up the flowers and then pulled out with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid was it that the two girls had followed and spied on them? Creepy.
