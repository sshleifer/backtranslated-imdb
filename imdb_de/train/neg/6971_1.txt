All this shattering waste of footage has to pop up Count Floyd every 60 seconds. Somehow they had Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and could not be closer than eight kilometers before a movie. YOUNG does the stuff. There is no original line, thought, recording or effect from the mindless opening sequence to mindless closing. The magical, ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big mistake - boring. If it's a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a documentary of life. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie has its own explanation for its bad behavior. Usually it is in the opening credits - "Written, Directed and Produced by" a man. Or at the very center of the action is some Bimbo who is so talentless that there is only one reason why this turkey was made. Here's no telling until the last credit, where the cooperation of about a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged. <br /> <br /> At the moment I see MST Beast of Yucca taking on Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
