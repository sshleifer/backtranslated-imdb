Have seen this on DVD in the original language with English subtitles. Either the subtitling was very bad or the actual dialogue does not do much in the story and brings no character development. There are some HK stars, but the movie does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance, but it can become overwhelming in a short time. If anything, I think of a children's movie with its unbroken locks of combat weights, battle scenes, and manure plot. I'm sure I understood what happened in the movie, but the whole story was pretty bad.
