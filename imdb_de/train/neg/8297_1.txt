Pooh! Where should I start ... First, Campbell Scott's incessant fear becomes a real distraction after a while (a short while) as he internalizes his growing fear, curiosity, and anger. Only we do not care! These characters, as presented by the author and director, are totally unlikely and this is the key. They have not given us anything to worry about if they are adulterous and if they still love each other. When Scott quietly says to his wife, "I could kill you" in front of her three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly bad timing slipped, I almost wished that he had - and then did the same with the complacent Wisecracking Appearance of Denis Leary before being pulled out of the Looney container. A complete waste of time and maybe - just maybe - resources.
