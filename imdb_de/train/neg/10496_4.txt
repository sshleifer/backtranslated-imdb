Gday-mates! I just watched the movie with Croc Hunter. It was ok, but the show seems to be more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with fun lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snake fangs as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! For real, you know it hurts. and can not she jump up? He'll grab her by the tail and all. There were two MAJOR split shots in this movie. When Terry finds the baby Joey, she goes like "We have to take care of her, just like a baby". Woah! I thought she would breastfeed and nurse the child. that would have been PG-13. Has anyone noticed anything in Terry and much of Terry's knowledge of ritual couples? she knows her sex stuff. Film plays in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a Koala, Dingo and Joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. Even though a small one that turns out to be useless against the dynamite girl. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else is watching, try to agree that the fat fat woman of the Country Bumpkin with the herd of dogs is RIGHT the crocodile helpers. he ate her sheep !! I would be angry too!
