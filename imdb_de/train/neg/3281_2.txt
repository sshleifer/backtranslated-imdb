I suspected that the movie was going to be bad. I am a Duke fan from far back. Have three years TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see General Jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good. But to sum up, the movie was a rundown version of the TV program. Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the outfits of the original Daisy were equally revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was just awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle also have to roll in their graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you're an old, proven Dukes fan like me and my three kids, you'll be very disappointed.
