Since this movie was only 61 minutes long and nothing was going so well on TV, I decided to throw Revolt of the Zombies into the DVD to pass the time. Even when I recognized the era from which she came, I was very disappointed. It started with the strange opening quality of the opening score (what - no brooding music?) And the rather slow opening sequences. I figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some showers (White Zombie with Bela Lugosi), but that had none. Zero. It was hardly dramatic (except for the few moments when the burning eyes overlay the film to point out the fascination of a human being). Like the equally boring king of zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity, but nothing more.
