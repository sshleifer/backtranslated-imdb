Or maybe it feels that way. Anyway, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a carpet, bland as a flour sack and as exciting as a rock ... and as smart as all three together. <br /> <br /> Okay, plot a nutshell (matching vessel, that ...): A doctor (Moss) is bitten by a bat while he checks out a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and transforms then into a bat - well, not just a bat, but a bat. Like a creature that looks more like a werewolf killing its victims in a first-person camera view .... <br /> <br /> But then there's the sheriff's (Pataki) business he bothers people, he marries married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdashery (the FIEND!), He smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and speaks at the same time, which makes him look like Buford T. Justice and sounds like "Smokey and the Bandit" and (that's the worst part) ... HE IS THE MOST POSSIBLE CHARACTER IN ALL THE FILM! <br /> <br /> The whole movie is just a TV movie of the weekly Crapola (Guano in this case). It's an AIP to cry aloud! What did you expect, Oscar-caliber stuff? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? <br /> <br /> How about ... no stars for "The Bat People", full version OR MST3K version! By the way, if ever there is a sequel to this movie, I bury my TV.
