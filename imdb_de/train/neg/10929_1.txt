This movie was the most beautiful Mormon movie ever made. It made the RM & Sons of Provo like well-made films! It should be funny, what I was told. The best was the best actor in the movie - Travis Eberhard - if he was not in the movie, he probably would not have been made! He decided! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. It was beaten 8. It had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character did not make sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He did not make fun of Brokeback 5 it 4. It was the first movie in which Clint Howard was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 for comeback 2. You should have been part of Surreal Life Auditions 1.
