"The Leap Years" is a film from an e-novel by Singapore-based writer Catherine Lim, which was the first Singapore novella to be sold over the Internet. The film had a devious schedule for post-production: In early 2005, the film was released for the end of 2005, but only three years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year, it appeared. <br /> Before I say anything, I have to admit that I'm not a fan of the romance genre. So I may be a little biased about this film - I only saw it because it was a Singapore production and it is available for loan in my neighborhood library. Here are my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> First, let's say that apart from Qi Yu-wu's KS and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here seems to be remarkably Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and Wong's trio of mates are all Eurasian. Does this film preserve the stereotype that Eurasians fall in love and are associated with Eurasians, more "in" than the ordinary Chinese (or whatever the Asian race you are?) I do not know, it seems to everyone Case to be like that. In addition, everyone in the film speaks a mystical "anglicised" accent that exists nowhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's a kind of "semi-perfect English" that the authorities would like us to talk about, but that does not exist outside the MTV channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and stilted, which is not helped by the lack of true blue singaporeans in the cast. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one-liners one-liners. After twenty minutes, the "joke" of the film begins to let go and the film begins with its usual clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I guess I did not enjoy the movie because the premise of maintaining a love affair over 16 years of age seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other unbelievers in the movie. I can not believe for one that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall in love with a friend of Wong's. And the scene where the groom says, "Go before I change my mind," has been used in a hundred East Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) TV series ... <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair and Wong Li-lin tries her best, but the script does not help her. Joan Chen, as a senior Wong, has a 15-minute bit part in the movie and is perhaps the best actress in the series, but hey, her role is just a cameo. <br /> <br /> When you come over "The Leap Years" at the rental or in the library. You may want to insert it into the DVD player for reasons of curiosity. However, if you do not really like the romance genre, you can decide whether you want to miss it or not.
