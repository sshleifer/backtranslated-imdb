"The House of Ghosts" is pretty awful. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship, as well as the ones that the film tries to describe, and while everyone knows that films are far from reality, this film treats viewers as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as they appear here, and of course, political processes are much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "The House ...". If you can not see this complexity on screen, it's better not to make a movie. There are many examples of how politics in the cinema can be taken seriously without so much in common. In some parts I had the feeling that Carmen Miranda is found in parrots and palms. When you talk about certain things, you not only have to be careful, but also respect the intelligence of your public.
