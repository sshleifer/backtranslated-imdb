Istanbul is another overseas film shot by Errol Flynn in the last decade of his life to support his family and avoid trouble with the IRS. It's a remake of the Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner movie Singapore from a decade ago. <br /> <br /> In contrast to this studio product, Istanbul has the benefit of this great film set location, right on the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was exponentially aging in every movie in front of the camera, was far too old to play these action / adventure types any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really have no conviction. <br /> <br /> Concerning Cornell, she plays Errol's former sweetheart, who now has amnesia from the trauma of being saved from a fire. She can not remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some bad people, led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are looking for diamonds that have come into his possession. Must also deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not know that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. Actually, he was first a pianist, the singing was an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for those who are fans of this kind of movie.
