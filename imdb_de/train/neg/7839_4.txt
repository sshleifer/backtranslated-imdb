Serge Farnel has critically criticized this film in the revue "The Rwandan Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). <br /> <br /> A criticism showing how France was behind the entire United Nations situation Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocidal forces. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers had been killed by the UN Genocide Force. <br /> <br /> Therefore, UN soldiers have decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the French trucks. <br /> <br /> They have abandoned the Tutsi, which is unpardonable, of course. <br /> <br /> But we have to remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
