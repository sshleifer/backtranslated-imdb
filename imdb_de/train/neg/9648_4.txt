Vipul Shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past. "Waqt - The Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, what he produced. His recent appearance as a filmmaker "London Dreams" is considered the weakest career of his career. <br /> <br /> "London Dreams" has a mediocre history, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. Granted, it has the potential, but if you see "London Dreams", you wonder what happens? This movie has perhaps the worst climax of recent times. Writer Vipul Shah deploys director Vipul Shah. <br /> <br /> The first lesson is boring, the second lesson is better; But again, the highlight is horrendous. How can someone forgive someone who has decided to destroy you? I will not Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness from his diaper friend thanks to his uncle Om Puri. If he comes to India instead of beating or abusing him, Salman greets him with band baja and says he was the cause of the whole fiasco. Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If so, then you completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is: Would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, do not fool us, we are sensible enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song remains in your memory. <br /> <br /> Salman is great though. He wears the film on his shoulders and really gets on very well in the emotional scenes. But again his character is portrayed as GOD, which makes him look like a delay in the end. Ajay is just as good, but Salman has completely overshadowed him. Asin is wasted and what makes a great talent like Om Puri in this movie? Rannvijay ham, though Aditya surpasses Roy Kapoor. Brinda Parekh is okay as a vamp. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this dream remains a dream!
