After reading some good reviews and hearing nice things about word of mouth, I decided to rent Come Undone. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. The story was hard to follow because the movie plays as a series of retrospectives between the present and the recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters are flat and uninteresting despite the best efforts of the actors. Sex and nudity are more explicit than they have to be. I have never seen a movie where the plot seemed so unnecessary. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions about a story that was not well explained at first. In my opinion, a waste of time.
