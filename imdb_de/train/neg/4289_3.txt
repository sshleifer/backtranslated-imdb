The education of Little Tree is not as good as it could have been. Little Tree is about things like the cycle of life and how you should look at a star to help you. What happened to the three R's? Reading 'Ritin' and 'Rithmetic? When the idiot talks to the teacher at boarding school again, he starts to cry and speaks to the sky. Oh my God. Sure, the lady was a bit tough, but then comes James Cromwell's character and takes him away. The audience thinks Little Tree was absolutely right. He should learn to adapt to the new discipline. Those were the times! Talking to a star will not change anything! Little Tree needs to learn that its revered guardians are not always right.
