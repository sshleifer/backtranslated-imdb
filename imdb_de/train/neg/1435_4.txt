Filmed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks, this film brought the world back to sight of what is left of "wild western Canada". When Archie started writing his stories for the newspapers; The idea of ​​the day was to tame the wilderness and convert the First Nations peoples. <br /> <br /> The film asks the question and asks the question; Why should an educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams of becoming something, but grasping the full meaning of that dream, is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story, right? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw that Archie became my living image of the "Cigar Store Indian", a very wooden character and not at all real - very well made by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality of it were only realized when he met and married his wife Annie. Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would take him to the front of the Englishman's world stage, not so himself, but Gray Owl - a Canadian native of the wilderness frontier. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie who can become a noble wild prototype. Mr. Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors are both well done. I have seen documentary films about Gray Owl and I think this is a good movie that can be added to my collection A great moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake landscape and real "Gray Owl" locations. <br /> <br />
