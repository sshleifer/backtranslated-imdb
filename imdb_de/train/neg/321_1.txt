Shecky, a damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently, I worked in a UK hi-fi & video retail chain and led their test department. We would go through many new entrants, they are expected to learn to find the various detritus that, in one way or another, return to the stores as nonfunctional. To test the resolve of these new employees, we would issue them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film, because if someone who had bought a particular model of a Goodmans DVD player that had this movie as a gift sent his DVD player back, he always sent it back to Shecky. Our new employees would be forced to test these machines for errors only with Going Overboard until they found one or two of their own disks. <br /> <br /> Well, why this movie is so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be as funny as Happy Gilmore or the wedding singer, must have been a bloody day. The rest of the crew stank, and what about Billy Zane? His name appears in some of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor. Insane. The production quality is absolutely zero. <br /> <br /> I would have been inclined to give up because they did not even have the courage to call them by their full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz" on release. Still, it's worth a watch to see how far Sandler has come and how deep he can go.
