"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with a few twists on the back. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the week. It's another cautious story about the temptation to succumb to temptation, and adds nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who happens to have a substantial trust fund. Although he has everything, he risks everything when he enters into a steaming side affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a blond blonde from Cedar Falls, falls hard on Brett and she does not take it very well when he fumbles over his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appears dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When the police question Brett, he promptly points his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be loitering by the minute - not that she was previously the image of stability. Their defender (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and hell is anxious to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did she do that or not? How will it end? The answers to these questions can be found the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" is broadcast on your local station. And do not miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
