In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman holds hearings on the first uncensored television network. They try the programming, which is played as a series of skits. I can call the good sketch sketches with one hand, not my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Note that I did not mention Tunnel Vision. The reason for this is that this "movie" is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are funny even remotely or even a little smart. Filmmaking is a kind of great inability to even make me laugh. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn is full frontal
