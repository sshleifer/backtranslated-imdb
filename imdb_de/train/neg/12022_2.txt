The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution fails. <br /> <br /> The movie lacks pace, for one. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and on average. There are not enough obstacles and inversions to relax the tension, and there are scenes that do not really move the story effectively. <br /> <br /> The producers should have seen this in the script and rewrite it as a major. Unfortunately, if the producer is also the author and the director, obviously this will not happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting seems pretty flat, and that's up to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because with better writing, editing and directing, this could have been a really good thriller.
