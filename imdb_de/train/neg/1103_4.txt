As a young black / latina woman, I always look for films that depict the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I would enjoy it. Unfortunately not. Although the themes of the film are interesting and relevant, the story just was not developed properly. The movie has been kept moving and many of the characters appearing on the screen come and go without contributing much to the overall movie. If the director had connected the scenes better, maybe I would have had a bit more fun. Honestly, every day I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor". I was just not impressed.
