I saw an episode Yeah, I've been through the whole miserable experience, and I have to say, this kind of comedy is one of the worst you can get. Imagine Peter Griffin, who became famous by Family Guy. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (admittedly slim and without glasses), except that now he's missing something that makes him funny. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah has no real character, no theatrical ability to dissuade her character. Maybe it's the banal, formula-like jokes that pull her comedy down even further than her character can keep to herself. Maybe it's the lack of credible slides. Their insensitive, bigoted personality may appeal to insensitive, bigoted people, in contrast to the mass incentive that Stephen Colbert's insensitive, bigoted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, listless character. It lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone for the entire world of comedy. What is missing Sarah Silverman, that is noticeable. And if you do not believe it and identify with it, that is not funny anymore.
