I've seen this movie a few times and never thought it was so funny, but it's still funny and good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about women who work in a company and their boss a jerk and they give him a taste of his own medicine and seek to gain the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80's stars who plays a good villain, not really evil, just unlikely. Dolly Partin is adorable and fun to see in comedies, and her southern joke really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does not do much for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the weirdest lines and made me laugh several times, I have to love her. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who likes the 80s comedy. I like the movie, but it has things I do not like. It starts well and has a nice river and then everything starts to come at once and care less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do, and although they are "cute," I thought it would slow the movie down. When the movie resumes, it starts to run again and the funniest things happen and then the movie slows down again to quickly collapse, which is too good to be true stars, but try it when you have it did not see. I think, depending on the mood, it can be more or less sympathetic.
