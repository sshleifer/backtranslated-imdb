This movie has earned a reworking of the Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth a watch because it is an inadvertent laughter uprising. Really! It's worse than "Destroy all monsters". Be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the Shriners were here), the obvious polyester Norfolk jacket from "Allan Quatermain", David MaCallum's bad stuttering (which made his even worse The distracting drama), The incredibly bad processes in all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the hand puppet that threatens the little girl, the giant snake that threatens the Macallum while sinking into oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes of the motorized crabs, the amazingly funny boat (oh, brother !!), which seems to be made of plywood, which is mounted on an old dredger and like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. looks. prom ("Journey into the future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman imperial armor but inexplicably carry Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet!) - and the worst , Macallum and Ekland (with their fear wig) play smoochy-face - oh the horror! Best of all, the intrepid explorers manage to lose the weird Frenchman, and the African snuffle-agagus or whatever else chooses heroic rather than in other scenes.
