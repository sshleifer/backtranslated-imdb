This movie is described as action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and James Belushi's presence suggest that this is a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins with a series of ridiculous plot twists that hide little of the invented ending. The film moves between comedy (description is loosely used) and surreal drama with some out of context related adult scenes. The main character (the angel of the title) is played badly, and the actress is not helped by the script, which requires something incredible. Extreme of the character to be depicted. James Belushi is the only one who deals well with his role, but is also disappointed by the poor writing. One to avoid.
