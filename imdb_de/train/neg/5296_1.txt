I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even with the standards of low-low budget exploitation, it's really lame. Even at the level of nudity and gore, it's unbelievably boring (there are some of them, but it's kind of ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not even have been theatrically released (though it may have been: Plan 9 From Outer Space *, which is being played in cinemas). There is exactly one good (and competent) line in the movie. I assume they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had some competent actors, and the rest was rather ridiculous hammy, which is fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could read and write fairly well.

And this film has a difference: it manages to under-sign for the greater part of the film, and then laugh it over for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I would have called the actress who plays the receptionist "..." the exception: she is by no means made of wood, not that she is good, but she is certainly not made of wood. Even the worst Slasher strikes are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this there does not even seem to be anything to provoke moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest "They were clearly expecting a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it's actually becoming intriguing in a strange way, I sat in much of the video wondering why anyone would bother , to do it.
