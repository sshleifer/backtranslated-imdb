As far as I can tell you, this movie is currently available on DVD, despite previous comments by other commentators. I found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I've paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax. I found it in a 98-cent store between shelves of plastic bowls and disposable swabs. Do not you feel people picking out Beau Coup dollars for the Super Duper Import Limited Edition? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start quarreling with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember the saying about what you paid for. Only for Slasher movie fans.
