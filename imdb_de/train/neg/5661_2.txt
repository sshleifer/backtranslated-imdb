The premise, though not completely ridiculous, was definitely ridiculous. What should have happened, on the second encounter with Tritter was that Tritter should simply be wasted. House hires a guy and skins tritters. In real life Tritter had been pulled up for harassment, rectal thermometer episode would have been revealed in court what occasion and opportunity would have offered, and the lawyers of the hospitals had made Tritter and the special department for which he worked, minced beef. He would be in jail, like anyone involved in the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The lawsuit would have given House a tasty settlement, enough to feed Vicadin into old age. Tritter would get anywhere in a taxi go and try to redeem himself by doing good for two years before people came to the fact that they had seen it all before.
