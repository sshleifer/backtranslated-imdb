Pyramid tips worth $ 25,000: deep blue sea. Shiver Slither eight-legged freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that were funnier and more exciting than Snakes on a Plane. Hell, with that definition, I'd have to include the pretty shattering pictures of Ted and Elaine on the plane! Snakes both in laughter and exciting superior. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this does not even come close to the mother of all unintentionally intentionally funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to the never-to-be-seen casting of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same movie, you had Jon Voight, who went over the whole movie. But his last scene is all that SOAP has tried to do as a "so ridiculous-it-fun" movie and has not done. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is the definitive proof that studio managers and fanboys make this the worst employee possible. Every big scene had been so much discussed and dissected in the last year, all that was amusing on the opening night was the amount of fanboy flop sweat that had to be wiped out in my theater. I heard more forced laughter here than in a studio that recorded "Jim Jim".
