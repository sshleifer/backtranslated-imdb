This movie was not programmed in Italian movie theaters, I saw it at a manifestation called "Fantafestival". I find it awful, because some scenes like music videos seem chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no need to film. Music is completely out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie looks interesting, but a few minutes later it gets busy. The story is interesting, but the development needs a complete review.
