So this guy named George is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women turn up. George's wife is in a hospital taking care of her son. When the woman is not there, George enters the bubble bath and loves the two girls. It's not that great of a scene because it really shows nothing. Then the birthday girl wakes up the next morning and the girls are still in his house. They make him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to pick her up, but when he gets home, the girls are still in his house. The girls are fed up with old George and do not want to cook for her anymore. They both turn out to be great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked the girls doing exactly what they wanted and messing them up in Georges house. George was not really great for his two guests. When George said he was married, he really did not seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker at Family Guy. I was for the two girls all the time.
