Well, it's all been said about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone else already said what should be said. But the thing is, I've seen millions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews of all the films I've seen. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The acting is stupid. It's really stupid how the newscaster expresses her grief over the plane crash. The nun is nice and the professional assistant taking care of the child. The three main murders in the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid the makers of this movie can be. Do not realize that even rip-off can still be scary. We do not see how the Granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant make me feel they deserve to die, you just can not sympathize with them. And Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have worked better. We only hear him scream and we see nothing!
