First and foremost, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she is just terrible. This movie has played every horror cliche in the imagination and everything bad. The above-sex teenage couple. The funny (not) horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The scary natives. The parental couple. Astonishingly, the virgin chick never dies in these movies. The dialogue is so painfully awful and comes with the depth of a paddling pool. It's almost as if you wish everyone would die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this movie some time ago, but somehow it got worse. Sure, the funniest thing here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, which is hard to assess even for this dog's rental. Avoid at all costs.
