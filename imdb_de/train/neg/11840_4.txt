Anything that may have been interesting in this material will be sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we're about to see will never be known, and "This is the rumor most commonly told" about one of Hollywood's most sensational "secrets." <br /> <br /> Okay. So we do not get anything new (and E! S's "Mysteries & Scandals" gives you a better overview of the incident ... and that's not a big affirmation). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. No big news there. Interestingly, we learn what a pure director is willing to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and / or in the political establishment. It begs the question whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks of his own experiences through these characters. But what is narrated is so cynical and ugly and confused that we feel guilty when we witness hot people posing themselves as stories. <br /> <br /> The sound of the film has a weird quality of dislocation that I find irritating rather than funny. We are empathetic with nobody. And the great "Citizen Kane" polishes the relationship between Davies and Hearts much more convincingly. In "The Cat's Meow" we do not always know about Davies motive to be with Hearst. As soon as one thing is said to us, it does the other. <br /> <br /> And shall we believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to trick one of America's most powerful - and seemingly weak-minded - citizens. The movie never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> What convinced are the production values. It is a magnificent replica of the yacht and historical costumes. I've been more involved in the construction of a few jackets for men's jackets than following a story that challenges many of Hollywood's best-known personalities. No one will remember that the script is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it more timid and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The actors can not make a mistake, even though Meg Tilly passes this parody. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the sincerest performance in a chewing landscape sea. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much that she seems to distance herself from the whole company rather than tell it. One of her first lines is "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wishes she was not. <br /> <br /> This is not Bogdanovich's trashy, bad, good, "long last love" relationship. It is trying on something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is so full of bitterness with the "beast" called Hollywood. This is "National Enquirer" filmmaking. And it not only soils the names of those the movie will put onboard the Oneida this weekend, but also gets the crowd pretty dirty.
