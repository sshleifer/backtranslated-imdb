The premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the dialogue banal and the end absurd. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but if you make him a Pepe Le Pew accent for two hours as a supposed Frenchman, that's not nearly as amusing as it sounds , <br /> <Meg Ryan is once again as cheeky and adorable as one (choice): Kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the cutest creature in the world. It has not the slightest resemblance to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This film is for me an opportunity seized by mates Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and southern France and get paid for it well. So I can not really blame them.
