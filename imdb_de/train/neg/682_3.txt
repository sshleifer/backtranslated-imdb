Please note: I see from the various contributions that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this movie. I saw the sound version and it was aesthetically disgusting. Considering that the original version was LÄNGER and without stupid dubbing, my review has to be read in that sense. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a good reputation as a filmmaker and Louise Brooks has cultivated something, this is in many ways a technically bad movie. While Hollywood switched to sound mode as early as 1929, almost to the mid-1930s, many famous French films were essentially silent films - with some dialogue and sound effects that were badly beaten over the film. The lip movements in many, and especially in this film, do not come close to what was said, and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could make a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred that they made a silent film - and as a silent film that would have been an average movie - with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent film. <br /> <br /> The problem I also found in the film was the all too easy presentation. It would have been fine for a silent morality game around 1920, but after 1930 the plot is a bit harsh (that means "old" - not "slutty"). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can not handle it. She gives up everything temporarily, but is lured back into the chic life and that means her end! A bit melodramatic, right? And also a bit simple and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally I found the character of the friend of the fiancee (?) Very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and taken up by his friend and everyone else. When he simply took it throughout the movie and came up with no solution, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received was mean. Should the audience laugh when he was abused? This seems to me to be what is implied and I do not like it at all. <br /> <br /> There are far better French films of that time (Le Million, Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others)) and better silent films. I just can not understand the high rating of this movie.
