After looking at it, I had lost some respect for Christopher Lee (this is over in the course of time). This movie was totally rubbish. At first they tried to make the end of the first "howling" with incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to make it a sorry excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot is shitty and the whole movie is just WONDER !!!! One brother of a werewolf victim from the first movie (it looked like Dee Wallace Stone) is working with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked the whole time. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money looking at nudity.). Try to catch the cable instead. It would be so crushed that it could actually make sense.
