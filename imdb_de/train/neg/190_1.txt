I always had the feeling that a good movie should have an action. This movie was missing a movie, and I think it would have been more effective with a plot. This was aggravated by the fact that it seemed forever; I finally wanted to finish it. I just realized that it only took 123 minutes. It felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot, but the film had no significant conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I always said until I saw "The Fast And The Furious." So, do not think that this review comes from someone who needs nothing but deeds. I hate most action movies today. It's just that this movie is on the other side of the spectrum. Not much happens in this movie. The scenery and costumes, however, were nice.
