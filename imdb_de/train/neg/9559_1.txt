I will try to use words to describe this. <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but then I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was "scared" when I found this out, but now that I've seen it, I have to say, it's even worse than I thought. Why these movies still get money still keeps me in the head. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not so good, but it has to be said that some people turn around because they are just terrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this? An attempt is made to be just a copy of the original, only when the locations have changed, every form of story has disappeared, and any attempt to actually create something that has not been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to bring it up to date, they try to make it exciting with the help of the whole theme of "big brother", but that was long ago leaked and offers between the beginning only a filler and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making tons of clues to the original '83, but in the end it was just funny and sometimes a bit sad. Conclusion: If you have nothing, and I mean nothing, do it ... look at it or play Frisbee ... with the DVD .... alone. It will be just as much fun. I promise it
