After Don Knotts had left the popular TV series "The Andy Griffith Show", he made a spectacular attempt with a series of inhumane, but matin√©-friendly comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", which (like most Knotts films) was filmed cheaply, is much worse than its others. Don plays a small town that will be included in the astronaut training camp ... but not as a space candidate - they want him as the new janitor! Some may say that the weak satire uses the then-fresh fever of the Americans for the new age of technology, but the movie is really just a stupid excuse to keep busy children busy. It's off to a good start with an OK setup and nostalgic venues, but it's becoming more and more mindless and idiotic. * from ****
