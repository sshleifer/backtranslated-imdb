A movie where you want to throw yourself on a sword. I've seen Schlock in my time, but after seeing the miserable mess, I do not think I'll ever see another movie again. May God have compassion for the souls who have done this. <br /> <br /> Premise - Ex-Army Quiet Stallion, underwear model-type character (actually well represented) is looking for the girl who sent him an Xmas card while serving in the military. Land with their Cabin Granola family who are right-hand woodcutters. The family needs him and it takes two hours for the chick to be a better catch than her liberal-looking French wine drinker, Porsche driving, talking loud mobile phone, lazy, urban glaring, Jewish-looking fianc√©. <Br /> <br /> The Bad 1d Sign, 1d Themes. Be hit with the pro-military theme over your head. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> The Good - Commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason It ends.
