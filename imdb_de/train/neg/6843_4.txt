Fairly interesting exploitation film in black and white by David F. Friedman. The main actress Stacey Walker is well-staffed and oddly attractive. It resembles a disturbed Renee Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This chick made only two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her friends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV program THE ROOKIES) with a different name. <br /> <br /> Best line in Tony's movie - "Will you make me, doll? Chicks attract me". Good b & w cinematography by Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many others). Good venues (cool pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange end, but fitting. A 4 out of 10 points. Best performance Stacey Walker.
