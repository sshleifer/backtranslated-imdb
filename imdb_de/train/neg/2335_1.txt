A film that was so insecure that the creators might have hoped to milk an original movie noir classic entitled "Farewell My Lovely," who believed the gullible would accept a remake. The characters are so mean and unattractive that they earned their cold reception when they first released it. Time just adds her absurdity. Since this was not the cunning, film, desperation or despair of the classical Noir, it was instead based on an intricate and pointless crime that would easily have led to several arrests within hours. As if that was not enough, it threw a completely sexless erotic attempt in which at least one of the participants had not bothered to bathe for several days. This made the mess even more painful. Find a good classic 40s or 50s movie noir instead of wasting two hours for this failure.
