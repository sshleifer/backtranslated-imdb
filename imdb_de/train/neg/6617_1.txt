It really shows that hype is not everything. Shows little by little what a crappy actor Abhishek is and only gets movies for his father and wife. Amitabh is solid as always. Ajay Devgan is as always shit and useless and the new is a joke. The leading actress is such a waste of an actor. Such a pathetic film by such a revered director and such a large industry. With movies as such, I have reduced the number of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has been making shitty films for some time now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek someone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Every other leading actress is a half-naked person. Pffffft.
