I'm a big Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I probably weigh just as much as he does, though I do not have the stocking to wear the Ruffled Mullet Ponytail. Having shown my affection and affection for America's most beloved stalwart stage and movie hero, I have to say with a heavy heart that this is his worst film ever. I'm not sure if he could make a movie worse. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problems with this film seem to be in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this movie should have a different plot. This leads to sad voice overs, in which Steve's voice is not nearly synchronized with the synchronized voice. The editing is pisspoor and everything starts off badly, gets worse and in the end, you wish you'd revisited The Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it is so bad. <br /> <br /> After that I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends are still laughing at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time to watch some of the Van Damme logs directly on DVD? If you're tempted to watch this movie, pull out your eyeballs and rinse them in the toilet. A darkness in life is better than 89 minutes.
