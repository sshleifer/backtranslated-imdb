Not that I was really surprised ... movies are never as good as the books they came from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, though I knew it would probably be shit. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they were too much dependent on the plot of the book, and the movie version did not reveal how horrible the house really was. The end was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of a really bad cosmetic surgery. Acting was inconspicuous at best. Making a theatrical version so she would not have to stay in Lifetimes Box "Made for TV Movie" would make this a better movie. If you've seen this movie, I strongly suggest you find the book and read it. I doubt you are disappointed and hope you enjoy it the way I read it every time I read it.
