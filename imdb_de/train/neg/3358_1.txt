The spooky remake of course. The original was a scary psychological thriller that has improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, just caricatures (the bitch, the authoritarian brain, the "I'll get out of here", the oh-so-sensitive bookworm). Given that the special effects were the "star," characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Cherubs fatten, stretchy doors, irritating dead children who can not just talk ... and an idiotically juicy ending that makes it absolutely impossible to give you a new age of butterflies and rainbows. I take my bowling games orally, thanks. Bruce Dern, I have liked you since "The Cowboys". Stop it.
