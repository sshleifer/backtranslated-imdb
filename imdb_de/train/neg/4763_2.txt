The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "reworking" of a great and dignified 1972 film a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching, I have done something good. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and everything goes awry. Kenneth Branagh makes an ugly, sterile note. He films the film from every artistic, distracting, self-centered angle. We see mirror images of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, headshots of 200 feet above, close-ups of eyes, chin and so on. The script of a Nobel laureate introduces long stretches of unpleasant homosexual jokes, which are faked by both parties, .... I believe ?? Given the character of "distortions," how would I know? The characters so richly drawn in the original are crass and unsympathetic. The running time was shortened by one hour. This is either the real problem or the nicest thing the director has done for us. The actors perform their productions effectively, but nothing they say or do is credible from a distance. Jude Law is more than Caine, but as a recognized producer Branagh must have had the blessing. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found that ugly to look at, not convincing for a former classic. Why was it done? The paying public spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A vanity work that fails every turn.
