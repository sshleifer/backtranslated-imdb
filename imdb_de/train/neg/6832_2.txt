I would have enjoyed this movie, but Van Damme keeps making the same old garbage. Poo Knickers fight scenes as usual. The only thing that left this loser out was that the Russians were usually killed in the end. This movie is absolutely doggy do of the highest nature, please, please, please, please, Van Damme is supposed to get acting lessons, you need them. Everyone who likes Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that Van Damme only acts as an actor when he writes the film, produces the film and plays the film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS QUICK BACK NASTY WIG. I give this movie two out of ten, because that was better with the Sandman. To insult the injury, I wasted a pledge on this crap
