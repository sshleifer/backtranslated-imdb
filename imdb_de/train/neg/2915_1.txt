It's a bad movie, it seems like there are only five police officers in HK, they did not use their weapon, and I feel like a movie by Jacky Chan. All the while, they used their weapon to point only to the suspect. When they finally use their weapon, when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the movie, it's as if all the good ones died without reason. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is also shit, the story jumps here and there and bored people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is just an OK movie. I think the US zombie movie is more bloody than this one
