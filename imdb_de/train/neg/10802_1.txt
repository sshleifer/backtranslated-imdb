Let me give a brief overview of the film: A lazy, rude child named Max encounters a radio with Kazaam: a knocking ghost. Like all geniuses he gives three wishes, but helps Max, if he is good-natured, also in his personal life, since he has to deal with thugs and a father mixed with organized crime. Meanwhile, Kazaam struggles from time to time (and also shows Shaq's bleak rap skills). <br /> <br /> This film proves what we all know: Athletes must stay at the sport. I admit it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this movie waste is terrible. The characters are either unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Damn, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would still be a joke. I know that the movie just drew because Shaq was so big at the time (no pun intended). I honestly can not say anything positive about this waste of time. Shaq should have used the time to use this movie for practicing free throws.
