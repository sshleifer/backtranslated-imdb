Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors. I swear he has no real knowledge of how to make movies. He made a brilliant movie, and that's a scary movie. scary movie 2 was alright, but everything Keenan did is a real disaster. Avoid such titles as a threat to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood ... I know what a title !!! Obviously in this movie too, everything Keenan mentioned in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half of stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. Just trust me on this point. Maybe women like this movie a bit because of some things that happen, but on the whole, this movie is not liked by anyone who has a good taste in movies ... 1/10 ....... Seaton
