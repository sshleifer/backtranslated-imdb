There were many unknown films or bad reviews films that I liked very much. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was overclocked and used camera technology that made me feel like seeing a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and it took most of the movie to get started, letting you ask, "is that it?". After I decided not to take the movie too seriously and look at it from a mere look, it became more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have run on MST3000 while it is still running.
