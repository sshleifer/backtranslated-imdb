Do not you hate it when you order a steak, but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> That's how I felt at the sight of this so called "Battlestar Galactica". The quality can be argued, but the fact remains, it's NOT what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine sitting down in the proverbial restaurant I mentioned. They've been waiting years for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak that they loved. When your meal arrives, notice that they have used the name "New York Strip" on a chicken dish. They complain but the waiter says only "but cheeken, ees really good zir"! Are you really interested in whether the chicken is good? They wanted the New York Strip - a STEAK! The waiter then explains: "You zee zir, the cook wanted to do it as you zayzing, zomezing NEW." We found that Che cheeken was more popular when we gave him the name of our previous delicious Deesh. " You're wondering if you'll ever find the Original New York Strip on the menu in the future. However, they are informed that the restaurant "New York Strip", which is now on the menu, will never see the Original New York Strip. Again and again. <br /> <br /> This is the case if you create something NEW and put the name tag "Battlestar Galactica" on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is an affront to all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the production team was responsible for this new version, which was obviously a disregard for the original. The team tasked with resuscitating BG should have loved the original LOVED series - with the goal of improving what the fans loved and not trying to shamelessly sell this new series by the name of Battlestar Galactica give us a NEW show, then do it! Give a new name! Do not use the name we like to remember to attract viewers. This effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We waited 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we liked the original! We did not just want the name and the remains of the basic concept. There are things we LOVE on the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the BEST elements of the original were probably the ones left out. Sure, the original BG was incomplete and could need a few updates. However, this miniseries was in no way an improvement, but the special effects (which were good for today's conditions, but nothing unusual). Many viewers will debate the quality of these things back and forth, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> That's to say ... I'll give some remarks on the merits of this new mini (not compared to the original one): <br /> <br /> The combat sequences were the best. It was obviously made sure that the effects appear "real" and less "Wow - look at this effect". I would not say that these sequences were extraordinary by today's standards, but they did correspond to the original cable films. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views attempted to simulate the effect of a "real" camera with delayed tracking and jerky zoom. However, it was stressed too much, considering that there was no obvious source for these cameras. The infinitely smarter series, Babylon 5, is the only case where I've seen such "live cams" used effectively when we supposedly saw action by security cams. <br /> <br /> The script, you ask? The script felt like it had been written by a teenager for other teens. The characters felt cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the whole story felt like other familiar stereotypes. The only good features of the entire story were the few elements that were obtained from the original series. It was obviously "dumbed down" for the digestion of your average television audience. <br /> <br /> The human interaction was pathetic. Instead of dramas based on subtle looks, expressions, and fine timing, every moment of human tension was so exaggerated that they were so obvious that they had lost any ability to move any refined viewer. This was obvious in every interaction between Adama and Son. The director must have tried to make sure that the densest and most sentimental observer does not miss it, even if he is not careful. I'm sorry, but real people do not always behave like that. <br /> <br /> I did not think that would have been a bad show if she had stood alone. Nothing great; It's never worshiped by real sci-fi fans or craftsmen, but it's watched by the masses. But I could have lived without it. I just saw it to see how it really captures the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> The memory of this mini series is a symbol of how the quality of storytelling has been pushed aside to address larger numbers. How even SciFi Channel has "muted" its productions to serve the masses, unlike its real niche market, the science fiction fans. It's going to be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you just one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
