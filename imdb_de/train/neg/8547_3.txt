This was a pretty scary movie; I found the music to be effective. The photos Mario made of the village were also disturbing. However, I had three problems with this movie. For one thing, the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was hard to tell what was going on, but this might just be my copy. The second point is that the beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but apparently some people are doing it. Of course, there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s. All in all well visible, but not nearly a favorite.
