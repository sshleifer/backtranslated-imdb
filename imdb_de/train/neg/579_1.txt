Listening to the commentary by the director confirmed what I had suspected when watching the movie: This is a movie made by a man who wants to make a movie. The storyline is the kind of stuff that stunned teenagers burn out as they go through the "I could write a book / script / award-winning sitcom phase." An interesting idea is anchored there (probably because it's a sequel to another movie), but it's completely hidden under a signed, poorly executed, and ridiculously ill-conceived script. <br /> <br The lines are bleak and the performances are uninteresting, although I again want to blame the director. He does not seem to have questioned the actors at all about what's needed, but put the script in his hands, pointed the camera at her, and told them to keep going. Who knows, with some coaching, these actors could have done better (say, what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> <br As it stands, the actors do not have any chemistry. A nice opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism in parallel will be missed if Bon Jovis figure is infected with vampire blood from his sick fellow hunter and he receives a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they were also vaguely interested in each other during the rest of the film. The only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leashes is the random entry of the directors. Originally, he had intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more meaningless account of the plot - I think the end product could have been a lot worse off. But not much. <br /> <br /> To be honest, movies are badly plotted, stupid and forgetful. Even when it comes to dirty movies, it's not sexy enough or bloody enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and damn little romp, but the director has left more comedy for some wrong reasons.
