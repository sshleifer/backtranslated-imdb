This is one of those movies that should be a lot better than it turned out. I'm scared to think what the blockbuster-approved cut should look like, because the director's DVD cut was boring with the epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be "The Godfather," but one or two acting lessons might have been useful. <br /> <br /> There were so many nice men in this movie, but unfortunately they were unused. I like watching a bunch of beauties pushing around in their BVDs as well as the next guy, but even I have a right to expect something more. It was not a total loss; At least we got a look at a Drew Fuller (covert) trash and a really annoying haircut. And Huntley Ritter looks even prettier than in "Bring It On" (and also as an actor). There is always a silver lining, kids. You just have to look hard for it. And occasionally you need to use the pause key.
