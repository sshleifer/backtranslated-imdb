This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely terrible, John Carradine only has a very limited screen time. All the characters are boring and the story is terrible, and I could see the twists and turns miles away! The great scenery and scary house would definitely have helped if it were not so boring and there is no character to choose from. I also hope that it comes under the last 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up, it's a pretty good scene, but it's way too late, and the only other screen time he'd had was in flashbacks, and the only really bloody scene in the movie is if one Figure his face gets screwed up by Bee as it was pretty bloody. I got this in a DVD horror set called Back From The Grave, and I think they're all really over the top, and it's fortunate that it was in a set I bought, otherwise I would have it tilted out of the window. This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely terrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen time, and I say, avoid it like the plague! They do not want to go through the torture. The direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson is doing a terrible job! Job here to make everything look cheap, to waste its potential for a spooky atmosphere and to keep the movie at an incredibly boring pace. The spectacle is just as bad. John Carradine is good at his scene, but aside from the fact that he is little else than flashback scenes in the movie. (Carradine rules !!). Merry Anders is terribly exaggerating like Laura because she did not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is okay and a bit scary, but also over the top, she had a scary smile in the end. Rest of the cast, I did not pay enough attention either because I had trouble getting through, but they were all really bad. Overall, please avoid this, it is not worth the torment! BOMB of 5
