The combination of Priyadarshan and Paresh Rawal was already golden with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA before, so I went into the movie with high hopes (at an Indian multiplex), especially after the sleek promos. Unfortunately, this film, like HULCHUL before, was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which was initially outdated, continues to stretch without development or additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had looked at it at home, it would have been much easier to reduce my losses). The performance of Akshay Kumar is at best average and John Abraham should not try again to make comedies. The comedic aspects of the movie were a whole week. I can only remember how twice giggled the whole movie. Definitely not a laughing stomach laugh that took me to HERA PHERI or, to a lesser degree, AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, he did not have much of an influence in this movie because his role and character did not have much room to grow. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who has only one appearance in the movie, was having fun while she was on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY. Otherwise it is better if you pass on this movie.
