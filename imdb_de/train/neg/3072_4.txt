Margret Laurence probably had no intention of having any of her novels adopted for the film, let alone the Stone Angel. Hagar as a character was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay, who dares, anyone?) And in the end almost sacrificed her humanity. The symbols in this book (the stone angel, the silver thread, etc.) are a constant reminder of this battle between old and new and the bloodbath (so to speak) on the way. <br /> <br /> While the film is somewhat faithful to the storyline of the book (but it's not really a kind of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of the movie. Hagar defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there. Bram could have been much more raw than depicted, and Hagar's father could have been played "traditionally" as it were. If the filmmaker insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would bring the point home. <br /> <br /> Why should we see cell phones, organics and other refurbishments? Let's try to score some points to score points (like the Muslim girlfriend and the natives). Hagar and Co. are anything but politically correct in the book, why should we see that in the movie version? The modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send subliminal, politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and the movie) seems to strike one's hands Intellect throw br /> There's the audience too. It seems we have been conditioned to regard bitter old people as cute and loveable. Why should you laugh every time Hagar is in her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at Hagar or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and terrified, and all we have to do is laugh at them. I do not think that Hagar and other people did not live up to their situation either.
