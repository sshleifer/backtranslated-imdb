In the beginning we see the beginning of a secret council of some kind. It all looks very promising. With some supernatural elements, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who looks like a good guy gets into trouble because he is entitled to money that he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really have a feeling for the guy and you want to know what's going on. Normally, a person would have several options in their situation. Somehow he does not have these options. In this film, there seems to be only one solution, though it's clear that it's not his fault. Out of the blue he meets characters who talk about church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to his problem. It should be obvious at one point in the movie what this solution is. Now I want to say that there is nothing wrong with this message. It's always helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message? This religious element has ruined the viewing experience for me. Although the message is good, the simplicity of the fact can not escape the fact that in real life, more needs to be done to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery presented to us is never solved. Instead, you have to deal with another topic that has essentially nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is appropriate, but if you look closely, you'll find that he's not serious at all. He really has to be desperate for money. Otherwise, what would an actor of his caliber have to do in a movie like this?
