I found it a real task to sit through this movie. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it hard to understand what was said. There was little that could drive the plot, and often the action simply stopped, and there was a long time of conversation that seemed alien to the film. These conversations alternated between family groups and the observer had to try to identify the similarities that made up the common thread that bound them together. It's rare for me to rate a movie as low and doing so in this case as I had to think, "What should I do?" Because of the overall visual experience.
