Dr. Seuss would be angry if he was still alive. Cat in the Hat shows how film productions can turn a classic story into a brainless pile. We have Mike Myers as a notorious cat in the hat, big mistake! Myers proves that he can not act in this film. He behaves like a sparkling showgirl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are fine, somewhere between the lines boring and annoying. The story is like the original with a few changes and, like most movies based on other stories, never tune with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who would never achieve anything in life. This movie is like a rejected comic strip of the newspaper, if you think about it. The film certainly looks sticky! Sure, there is a witty adult joke where the cat cuts his cock and censorship starts before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch had spit and the movie was really good! This movie is a cartoon-like piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocrity. Was Mike Myers even in this movie? And something else, the fish. What's with this stupid fish! The first time you see him, he is a real fish. The next time you see him, he will be lively and talk. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber! This movie is a total wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised that there were even good jokes like the waterpark joke, that was good. So please, if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.
