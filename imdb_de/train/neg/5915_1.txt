I have seen many, many films from China - and Hong Kong. That's the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown Pleasures". Yesterday I saw "Platform" and thought that Jia Zhang Kes other films have to be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I will not look 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow night, because I have just put all three films in the bin! Who gave this film "Platform" ten, must look more cinema! The photography was very bad: it was very difficult to distinguish between some characters because there were no close-ups. The story was so incoherent that I quickly reeled it out of sheer frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not presumptuous cheaters!
