I love the comics. Although I have trouble understanding the stories? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was up to. Surprisingly, I understood the main story? but some extremely bad decisions were made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad-looking "CG Human Actors" - in close-ups? ??Why?! It did not work at all !! Horus - and the other Egyption gods - were successfully made in CG and are very similar to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think this movie could be a cult movie with real actors. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
