Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes pretty good horror movies, but failed here. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, who was imprisoned in the 17th century because of his pain sensibility and the desire to attract pain, as well as the observation that others also have pain. The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to the next, and I got confused what was going on and what the purpose of this movie was. All I saw was a young woman caught by a strange lesbian trying to keep her to herself, and the young lady was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and learns that he is out to and then Englund steps on to another one who claims to be a descendant of the de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the Madam Momoselle (who wrote this wrongly) or whoever it is in the picture above the De Sades Wall. The movie was awful, I'm surprised that Hooper put Englund in this movie, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the part through the eyes. Englund tries a comeback from his former train "Nightmare on Elm St." by using these needles to put on and take off to erase people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
