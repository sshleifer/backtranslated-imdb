As someone who likes hunting scenes and was really fascinated by this fascinating story of real life, I was optimistic to visit this movie, but too many obstacles came up to the good story he should have had. <br /> <br /> THE BATH - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role as an insurance investigator is boring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bland and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is a real garbage-mouth. From what I read, several directors have replaced themselves in this film, and that's too bad. You can say that things are not right with the story. I also could not get involved with Treat Williams's account of Cooper. He should have been fascinated, but he was not in this movie. It is also a sad remark that a guy committing a crime is a kind of "folk hero", but I admit that I have chosen the guy as well. I can not complain about the landscape, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I would like to have this movie re-done and made better because it's a unique story.
