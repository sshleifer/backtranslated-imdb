"Ambush" is not an ordinary action strip. It's too bad to be normal. A man approaches the other with a machine gun. The other man shoots a round and beats the man with the greater firepower, without even a lead-beating strike down on him. Guess who is the good guy. Moron. Such is thoroughly ambushed. No good action movie, no good drama, no good movie, "Ambushed" fails on all levels. The cast of B-movie veterans goes through the movements mechanically, as if they know they're a real loser. Not recommended for everyone. <br /> <br />
