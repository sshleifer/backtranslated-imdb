Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and should be read by this screenwriter. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for a novel. This movie is unbearable to see if you've read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole "red room" is so downplayed that I wonder why they even do it. In the book The Red Room 'is a prelude to the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie, I'm sure she was happy to die and go early. In the book she is one of the most convincing characters and she was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story, as Charlotte Bronte has masterfully told.
