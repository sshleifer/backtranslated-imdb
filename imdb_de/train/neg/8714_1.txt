I just could not stop laughing !! This movie is hilarious and stupid! But no matter, that is very entertaining! In this movie, you do not have to pay attention! The spectacle is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the stick holding T-Rex for a moment.) The birds of prey are the same as the Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is the same, but ... In some scenes his head looks a bit stuffed and it looks like a project failure from kindergarten. Action is fast, sometimes too fast. Actually, I'm talking about fast editing, they've worked so fast that we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! they are rubber too late! Well, it's only interesting to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
