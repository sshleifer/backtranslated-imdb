Ye Lou's Purple Butterfly film sets up a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in the war in front of Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) are following a fortuitous meeting on various sides of the conflict. <br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film replaces a tortuous, semi-historical conflict for an action without giving viewers a single reason to worry about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shift does not help, as it seems completely unwarranted and meaningless. I usually do not care about dark films, but the lack of light, crispy shaky camera materials, and generally poor filmmaking techniques make this movie really difficult to watch and interest. I also agree with the viewer From Georgia, this film has "a chaotic style of editing and claustrophobic cinematography," but I do not think that will help the film. The background of the movie is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not think you can do it justice if you edit it like a Michael Bay movie. The overly melodramatic moments do not contribute to perceptibility. <br /> <br /> The actors are all appropriately melancholy. Zhang Ziyi shows once again that she has an exceptionally limited spectacle span as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all of her films. At least, she does add some variety to the role by doing the chain smoking and the worst love scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. All in all a very disappointing movie as it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2.10
