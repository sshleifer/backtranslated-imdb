Richard Pryor's early 80s, which ran down the street in a fire, must have somehow influenced him. As he gets up, he jokes that there are great laughs. It seemed to have something to do with the projects he had selected. The toy is about the lame thing he has ever chosen except for another du. <br /> <br /> A movie in which a white man buys his son a black? Nice little bit of political impropriety before you was something like that. It's Richard who gets totally emotional, which made me leave before the end. I wanted to get Pryor equal with this brat, instead it becomes the misunderstood naus of the kid! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore that and look at Pryor with Gene Wilder or one of his 70s years. This is a waste of time for every movie watcher!
