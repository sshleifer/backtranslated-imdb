When I saw the show for the first time, the first episodes were promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman. The show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the story, the main characters lose their original personalities and acting skills. In Episode 5, Bill's wrinkled eyebrows are so low that his face is just one forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even deadlier than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she only reacts to how beautiful it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they let the main characters sleep together early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that intrigued me and could easily be played with a little more. As soon as Sookie loses her, she wavers like a dead man, thinking only of Bill's libido and the size of his follower. Bill also loses his courtly attitude and well, he just gets stupid. His actions are never really explained unless he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never explored when there is love. So far, it just seems to be the sex that is the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually same sex, but come. Every five seconds I see a kind of humping. It was not a big surprise as HBO always tried to pass a softcore porn as a decent TV show. Bill, who jumps out of the mud and just does it with Sookie, for no reason, what's that? I laughed so hard that I almost peed myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into details. All events that happen are usually inexplicable. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like is the minor characters. Tara and her drunken mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to watch the show is for the development of minor characters. <br /> <br /> Without the sex and the main characters, the show would be much more rewarding.
