While the 3D animation (the highlight of the show) did a good job, most of the other elements failed. It was as if the filmmakers thought, "Well, it's going to be 3-D, so we do not have to work so hard on the storyline or character development." And the fact that it is a children's film is absolutely no excuse. The audience is drawn by three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) as well as three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension one of the main characters showed was the two-dimensional scooter, which from time to time twisted the plot with its compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin's appearance at the very end (after watching a very robust cartoon version of the same historical character for an hour and a half) appears on the screen ruining all good times, calling the movie's main characters "pollutants" and calling the situation hip actually on the screen was an impossibility. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you just want to tell the kids that the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you're at it?
