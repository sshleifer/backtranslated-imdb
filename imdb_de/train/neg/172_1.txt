The return to the hut by the lake does not stand up to the original in any way. Since only one main character (Stanley) returns for the Sequal, the movie is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the story and the drama were really good, but this is a movie I'll never see again. It's basically the same as the sequals of Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with much worse acting. Personally, I've seen how to play better in soap operas, it's so pathetic that you just have to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, and if I look at it, it will distract me from the first movie.
