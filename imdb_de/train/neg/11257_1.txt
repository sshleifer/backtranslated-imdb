This movie feels so empty. In each scene of the movie, the maximum number of actors on the screen is about 10. Since everything was shot in front of a blue screen, there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird. <br /> <br /> The trade was awful! It's so obvious that this was in front of a blue screen, because in all the action scenes you can see that the actor / actress is wondering about half the run, when to run for her life /> <br /> spoiler : You too will hit your head when you look at the movie. There are about 100 planes on the runway at one point in Sky Captain's home base. They have warned that an attack is coming ... What are they doing then? Nothing. All planes are blown up and again the ONLY person who defends himself is the Sky Captain ... The whole world is under attack and he is the ONLY person to ever fight back. At the end of the movie, you finally see hundreds of layers taking off ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
