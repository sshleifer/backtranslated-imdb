I wanted to enjoy this movie so much. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it had been on TV, it might have taken 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? A great cast and a photographer were working on a faulty foundation. If this is loosely based on the director's life, why did not he get someone to see that the writing itself was "loose"? Then he set it up at a snail's pace, which was possibly the source of a few people taking a nap during the movie. The music is rising, but for another movie, not for this movie ... for Opera Saga. There were times when the dialogue was incomprehensible when Armin Meuller spoke steel. I was not alone because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood make better films? This had the nugget of a great story, but was executed poorly.
