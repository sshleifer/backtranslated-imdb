As a Slasher movie lover, I usually choose to watch every slash movie that runs across my retina, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I'll say. Sleepwalking II happened to come with me during the canal-surfing the other night. Of course, I wanted to try it, since I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp series, but had never seen one of them (too bad, I know). I'll point out that, since I did not see the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because maybe what I think is wrong is deliberately intended by the franchise's own design. I assume that Franchise of Sleepaway Camp is a joke in itself. Damn, even the name comes as a deliberate joke. Sleep in the camp It's great fun. I appreciate the movie because I just want to put something together for the horror value of the camp, but that's about as far as I can. The acting in this film left the cast of the original Friday, the 13th, as if those present had a rendition of Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, the vicious killer who does not touch reality, killed my interest better than the entire cast. As for the comedy, there were a few times I giggled, but there was little and far between. <br /> <br /> Finally, SAC II is pretty boring and I really wanted to sleep in the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can hardly appreciate them. If you're looking for a Slasher comedy movie with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread.
