With such a title it is far beyond my understanding that this movie did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there are some neat greasy moments and a bit of thrill, but the way the movie was filmed and the whole storyline was like an idiotic and lazy attempt to practice a "shock" tactic who raped and murdered a woman stranded at the roadside. He and his brother are detained until his brother breaks out and meets his girlfriend in the woods. In the end, he forces her into a house where she shits. Later he shows her a collection of abducted men in the basement. The heavily drugged prisoners consist of her old friend who raped her, a "gripping" neighbor and her sexually scratching boss. He explains that he will kill them all. She manages to kill HIM and then turn to the men (or pigs) she torments and kills herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with eating and destroying genitals - all of which are distracting and essentially mild. The best scene is a masturbation with a graphic broomstick, followed by a painful rape ... Surely, "I spit on your body, IP! S on your grave" was thought to be an unofficial sequel to "I spit on your grave" - ​​based on mainly the title and a reference that indicates the main character - suggesting that her mother was Camille Keaton. Personally, I think that's a wild blasphemous statement! This movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strikes shocks but has failed miserably ...
