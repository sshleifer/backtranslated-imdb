This film starts with a certain promise. In my view, however, he loses it when the protagonist abducts the Good Samaritan, who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger starts repairing his car while he's on the phone is not plausible enough, but that she's one of the few people in the country who can help him get his family's life back on track the Random Beginner type is warned against using them in their stories. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie best. The artistic orientation could have been much better than that of cinematography. The show was good and Eva van der Gucht also sang.
