This is a movie about tired but funny childish clich√©s. There is a Nazi Witch Master who performs experiments related to the Sf in the basement. Oh please! <br /> <br /> In terms of a creeping sense of horror and anxiety, the general impression of the film is the impression of a very immature notion of fear. I had no expectations in advance and am left with an old Xander from Buffy and a heroine with a monkey-like face who does not seem to know how to behave. Said Adrienne Barbeau, whom so far I have only met in the much more enjoyable "cannibal woman in the avocado jungle of death". <br /> <br /> Camera and editing contribute to the general impression of lameness.
