My wife is a fanatic on this show. That's why I bought her seasons one to three and Season Four is commissioned. I personally think that the show is a big farce and the cast is just as bad. Alyssa Milano would have had to stop at the other garbage films she shot, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampires, just to name a few. I've seen better special effects in Republic Pictures' series that I saw as a kid. I can understand why the male lead roles stayed on the show so briefly, though I do not know if it was their own choice or not. You're welcome. Please do not renew yourself for another season as it is enough, Bob
