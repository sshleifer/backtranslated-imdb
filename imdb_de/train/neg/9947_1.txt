This movie was awful. I swear, they did not even write a script, they just blew it all over the movie. Ice-T was hellishly annoying. * SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to see it * They sit down and have breakfast for 20 minutes. he could not be there for a long time. The ground was hard, it would be almost impossible to track him down without our dogs. And if ICE-T is on this hill and the Spaz-15 assault uses SHOTGUN like a sniper rifle (and then cuts off a tree with eight shells - it would take thousands of shells to cut down a tree of that size) and small arms will apply 100 meters as inaccurate. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light? I have not seen any scope for this thing. Even when he was shot in the stomach and kept walking, he was left behind and was bleeding right there. And the end, where he stuffs a stone or a cigarette into the boys' course. It would not blow him up and kill him. The bullet would still kill, kill Ice, but mess up the barrel.
