If they gave me the choice of negative numbers, I would use them. This movie was really terrible. I went to the cinemas expecting it to be awful, and somehow managed to beat my expectations. I wanted to go out but my girlfriend was driving and wanted to earn her money. I think we were both disappointed Color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of the supervillain, he seemed strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) was as psychotic and alien as Matt (Luke Wilson), friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson).
