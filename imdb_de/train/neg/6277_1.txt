This movie really tries too hard. If you're shooting a horror movie, at least give him a reason to believe in the audience. <br /> <br /> They wait and wait through the movie and expect a great explanation, which is not the case. Instead, it tries to be too smart and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the movie? where is it going? and more importantly, what the hell was going on. , , <br /> <br /> Why were you there and how is it related? just another faint sci-fi horror. I love the fake reviews on IMDb that say how great it is in related press releases to hit the movie (either that or the people have little horizons). It's not worth your 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than the fragile, but at least that has given you some thoughts and reasons why things have happened and have a bottom line. it does not and it waffle only with tons of padding, so it all feels scary. This movie is about as low as when a stranger calls. God, that was lame too. <br /> <br /> A great tip, if you want to make a horror, make it believable with arguments and explain to the viewer what is going on, so they have a catch in your story. Because if there is no justification or credibility, then there is no firm hold and it can not be scary. No disrespect for the cast or crew because they did a good job. it's just bad writing.
