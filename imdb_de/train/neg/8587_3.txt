This type of storytelling is unacceptable. The only reason this movie is anywhere above the 5 out of 10 stars is that it has George Lucas behind it and the titles "Star" and "Wars" in the title. This is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made distinctly superior films with superior history, writing and acting, but have not received recognition. This is a travesty. <br /> <br /> First things first. The history. Anakin's development? There is nothing. Apart from a little make-up around the eyes and a little yelling, there is none. He suddenly becomes the young, stupid, kinky Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader. The only thing that made Darth Vader consistent in the original series was his intelligence of how well he was at almost everything he did, plan, fight, you name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body for stupid insolence. <br /> <br /> Which part of Emperor Palpatine, who tells him legends of the Sith, does not indicate that the Emperor is a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fight scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone is flying around like teddy bears in an apparent dollhouse. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a gummy digital double jump. <br /> <br /> In a specific combat scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin were in peak climactic both Stop in the middle of parades and hang-ups to turn their sabers a few times while standing inches apart. I realize that the fights are choreographed, but that just made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was terrible. All dialogues were of tremendous quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did their best with their ranks, but that was just not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, plotting holes larger than the center of the universe, and absolutely no insights into the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: Nothing new is offered. We know the rough picture of everything, all that Lucas did was the coloring. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia were brother and sister, we knew that Luke was Anakin's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda went into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this movie. If that's all the fans wanted, that's fine, Lucas could not have done anything wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader and he asks for Padme and hears that she is dead, he awkwardly reaches out and yells "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". This scene screamed at the whole B-movie, and I half expected Darth Vader to go "DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER" anytime. That's what that is. A B-movie, disguised with a huge budget and an ultra-loyalist fanbase that will now settle for anything after the first two films have pulled down their standards to the earthmines.
