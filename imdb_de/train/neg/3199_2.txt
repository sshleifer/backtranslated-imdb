Joe Don Baker. He was great at "Walking Tall" and had a good bit part in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone ... the dark side has won. <br /> <br /> As with most people, my biggest experience with MST3K was, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's rich flesh and spit that strip completely. It's obvious they just started their anti-Joe-Don kick with "Mitchell," and here's their continuation of a theme. <br /> <br /> It does, however, make for a fun experience, but there are many choices. My Favorites - "John Rhys-Davies For Sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'", "None of them is spongy", "Why was she putting her prom dress to bed" and my favorite - "" Son of a .. What was he the son of: son of a PREACH MAN? <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don says in the movie, "a big fat nada". But here it actually has an entertainment value. You get a chance to get THIS version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. <br /> <br /> Oh, and do not try to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
