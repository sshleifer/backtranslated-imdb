I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but if you looked for writing and directing, he should keep his job as a journeyman actor. Like many others, I do not know how to categorize this movie. He was neither scary nor scary and therefore can not be described as a horror. The plot was so thin that it can not be a drama Suspense, so it can not be a thriller, it's just a bad movie you should only see if you're a fan of the Blair Witch project. People who liked this movie used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read into something that was not there. As with the Blair witch, people were scared because people assumed they needed to be scared, and it got shocking. This film actually started out well with the family, who met the locals for a deer. It looked like a modern liberation, but for the next 45 minutes (far more than half of the movie) nothing happened, the family looked after their holiday home, which was all pretty and lovely, but not the least bit entertaining. It was obvious that the locals were somehow involved somehow, but Essendon obviously has no idea how to make a movie exciting. After all, when something happens, it's not even clear how the father was shot, how he died (the sister said his liver was just streaked), and this Wendigo ghost seems to track down the apparent shooter in a very awkward manner with special effects 3rd grade. The film is called Wendigo, but no attempt is made to explain it clearly, the film ends in a mess and leaves you very dissatisfied. I would have left 15 minutes before the jump, but I wanted to see if this movie could save itself. Did not do it
