Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very unfriendly movie. <br /> <br /> The film shows that the promise for Ustinov is being released from prison for embezzlement. He persuades Robert Morley to leave so that he can take on his identity and hack him in a very chic company by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for movies. <br/> <br/> Morley sounds just like he did "Marie Antoinette" in 1938. Maybe he had to return to this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. It's hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith completely changed her way and produced a shattering Oscar performance in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith is a seemingly pale-faced girl, but at the end of the movie she's the brain of the outfit. Too bad that the letter did not go with her.
