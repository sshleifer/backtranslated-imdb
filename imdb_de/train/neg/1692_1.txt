Okay, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. Trying to be scary by just doing crazy camera work and loud noises, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes. How could the care center know that Yoko did not come to work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with something. He just came out of nowhere to push the conspiracy. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the room, the little boy or the father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the carer found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it.
