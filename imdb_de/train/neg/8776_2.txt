Michael Keaton was never really a good actor. In the films of Tim Burton Batman he always falls in the shadow of his big baddies. Here, he plays the role of a widowed husband who records radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to make contact with the living ... Well, this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller. Any place that shocks you is missing. Because there are far too many things that are inexplicable, undetected and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when everything gets so bad that WHITE NOISE is making a fool of himself? Really bad acting and gruesome cut, this movie is nothing to see. Michael Keaton tries to make a thriller comeback, but misses the target more than ever.
