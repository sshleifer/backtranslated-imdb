The film looks as if the director was forced by some terrorists to shoot this movie. It was supposed to be dino-dung. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie. Even the actors are not worth a penny. Do not waste your time watching this movie. The director should be shot in the head because he had the mentality to make such a bad movie. I mean, is not he ashamed to look at the faces of people after seeing his movie? The dinocroc looks like it's made from Power Point and a lot of cut-and-paste material. and it's the same old story. Man plays God. Creates a creature escapes and is happy to eat people. and finally, a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt have to come and kill her. blah blah .. You will find out the storyline in the first 5 minutes of the movie
