I can not believe this movie was shot until 1984. He has some ridiculous acting, not to mention one of the stupidest acts of all time. Who would ever ask the fat Texas Sheriff Joe Don Baker to bring an Italian he had illegally arrested in Mexico to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie does not say much about it - in fact, it's such a generic title for a would-be action / cop movie, as I can imagine. I'm glad I did just seen on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They mention the similarity of the female lead role with Elaine von Seinfeld ("None of them is spongeworthy") and tirelessly rip Baker's weight. This movie is probably no worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: When his title appears at the beginning of the movie, Tom says, "I wish I was illiterate, so I would not have to read that."
