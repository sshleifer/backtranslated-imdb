Well, I admit, I'm not a John Ford fan. (I just looked at "The Informer" because I'm trying to work my way through a list of the "big ones.") So, if you are, just keep going because you will not agree with me br /> What a reworked and outdated piece of stupidity that is! I'll say there's a good idea for a movie here (I've been thinking about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution), but as usual Ford is determined to bury him under excessive acting and cheap feeling. I suppose it's a bit interesting to watch for a while to see how the transition from the Silents to the "Talkies" is not so seamless - the acting styles of some of the Principals have too early to feel an endemic quality of movies and movies They seem to play better with title cards than spoken dialogues. (Of course, the title cards would prevent six times that Ford reformulates every sense of emotion.) What dialogues usually exist with a "They're always after me, good luck charms!" Quality compounded by the fact that each actor was apparently allowed to use his own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, the accents are helpful to remind us that we're in Ireland, because the sets usually look like they're being carried along by a German expressionist piece that will be filmed across the stage in the next soundstage. (It feels like you would see some villagers with an eagle eye to burn Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) Techniques are changing. Taste changes. I'm not going to think about how crazy it seems that this movie was so highly praised in its day. But it's not one of the classics that holds - rather a "just warning" of the sort of oversimplified Malarkey that Ford would devote to his career.
