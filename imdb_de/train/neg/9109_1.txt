The first Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth could they make a sequel so bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this sucks Amy Adams. She is terrible. And could not they have found a girl who actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean, come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. The Sebastian in the first film is deceitful, fraudulent and much more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel. And what about the story? It's basically like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a poor representation at his first school, according to the film, though he mentions nothing about him and his dating life and how he was with him Girl 2 - Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly decides to turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (maybe I remind you that in the original Sarah Michelle giller says, "You've parted with the FIRST PERSON you've ever loved because I said - so how can he get in And he's all nice and charming and all "good person" as he refuses the sex of the chick his dad made threesome at the end of the movie, and then I seduced Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's awful, and I loved the first so much, I have not seen the third yet, I hope it's better than this prequel.
