(This may be a bit spoileric) First of all, I would say that I did not see the whole movie, nor could I, because it was obvious from the first lesson that I would be incredibly disappointed. Of course that's the problem with taking what many consider an amazing book and turning it into a Disney television movie. <br /> <br /> A Wrinkle in Time should be made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It has a great action that could captivate children and adults. It is also built in high quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they've changed to make it a visual story are what was so great about the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic," because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as extra tension without enough tension in the story. There was no need to remove Meg's glasses ... That robbed us of the possibly very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that appears in the book, but I also think bigger things as if the art direction was off. Take, for example, the way they made Camazotz look with its strangely darkened sky. The eeriness that appears in this book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like the earth. There are people who look like people. The sky is blue, the grass is green and children are playing. But something is a little bit wrong. The directors decided to make Camazotz a completely different one instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the entire direction of the film. The lesson is, of course, that Camazotz could be Earth if we forget how to love. It would have been a lot scary to have a nice afternoon as they walk down the street and the kids jump on the balls in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not observe the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end too. <br /> <br /> All in all an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
