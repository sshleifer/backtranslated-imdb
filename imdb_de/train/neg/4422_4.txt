This is a real bomb. We are to believe that Merle Oberon is the dismissed daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLay in the 1930s that he is worthy of support as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their quacks, trembling wives and backed by friendly uncle Harry Davenport. She comes on a blind date to her two maids, and Gary Cooper shows up. Some shots of the rodeo might have animated things, a la "Misfits," but with this one, no such luck is possible. Gary later breaks into a formal dinner chaired by Merle, and although invited to join the group, he reads a lecture on their snobbery. Where did the sudden eloquence of this recalcitrant cowboy come from? The most agonizing scene in the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished home for his absent wife Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
