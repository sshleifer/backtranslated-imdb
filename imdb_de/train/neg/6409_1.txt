I saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who have a star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know when I see it. This movie is terrible on every level. Technically, you usually do not know where you are in this movie, even within a scene. No cinematic logic. Emotional is bleak for the sake of the cause and the attempt to be a psychological thriller, if only it is confusing. Casting evil-looking red necks into your movie is a cost-effective way to convey "atmosphere." I had no patience with it long before the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends making MST3K riffs to kill them. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had two successful films, even though "Scooby Doo" could be listed in their resume. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) certainly can not find a vehicle for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to reappear in a movie like this one! (Even the estate of Patsy Cline should sue for defamation!)
