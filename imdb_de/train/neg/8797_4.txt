A never-ending madness of clever visual irony does not necessarily create a gripping movie. The "blond wig" half of the movie may not have developed from too much self-reliance on its makers. <br /> <br /> The Wong Faye half (with a very playful, if Karen Carpenter-looking Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, but the Story Girl Boy Story element goes back beyond artistic prudence. The character development is uneven. Emotion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Cantonese version of the cranberry hit "Dreams") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin version called Zhen Tuo. Both are on CD, though only "Mung Jung Yun" can be found on the official movie soundtrack CD.
