Wow, I hated this movie. The theme should have led to a really good movie, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there was a script at all - is a mess. This is not so much a movie as a random slideshow that has nowhere to go. I would say that there is nowhere fast, except that it is indeed the longest 81 minutes you will ever go through. As I said, the lead actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?) As his sometimes rough but ultimately affectionate and accepting mother. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here, because that's a mess. A pity, because I really wanted to have this movie, but it is basically a movie that was never made. Skip this one - it was not even worth the $ 6 I spent on pay-per-view.
