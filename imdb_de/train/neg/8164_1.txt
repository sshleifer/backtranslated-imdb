I saw this movie in a real movie (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I guess, and really in scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably never did that again!) And then sooo disappointed !! Just boring and not scary. The only redeemer I can remember was Corky Pigeon of Silver Spoons, and that was not great, just someone I recognized. I have seen bad movies before, and it has always been the worst in my head. This was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, not frightening wastes of our collective $ 6 and a waste of film. I've read some of the reviews that say it's worth a clock, and I say, "To each one of his own," but I would not care. Not so bad, it's good.
