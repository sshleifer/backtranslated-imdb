Not exactly a new plot, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a stunning woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although the other two are promised ... oddly enough, they still have the feeling that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A bit juicy in some places, but viva la love. As a romantic, I am almost obligated to tie myself up. My favorite scene is where Cusack lies on the ground and snow begins to fall. The final is almost too sweet, but the most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who can not get excited about Beckinsale? Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. Eugene Levy, on the other hand, is quirky and funny. Watch this with your soulmate.
