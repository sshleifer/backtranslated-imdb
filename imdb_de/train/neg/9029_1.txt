This film practically wastes the talent of every actor in a "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the action-packed "Top Gun" opening, it goes downhill with many clich√©s and unusual situations following each other until you try to choke on your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many never ending storylines in this film that I suspected at one point by putting together a discarded television series. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug lord role is ridiculous, and his "associates" were taken out of a Quinn Martin cop series in the 1970s. Costner's character is made of wood and gives us no reason to believe that he actually fell in love with Mendez's wife. We also have not convincingly come to believe that the wife longs for camaraderie and jumps the first hot body. <br /> <br /> Definitely a "B" movie and a big waste of time for everyone involved.
