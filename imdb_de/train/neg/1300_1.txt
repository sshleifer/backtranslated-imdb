This movie should never have been done. Honestly, I have to admit that I had some serious doubts before I saw it. The director is not a great actress, although she has made many films in Holland, and the young woman who starred is a TV personality with a constant smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other lead role that I recently saw in Bride Flight, and although this movie is better, he did not convince me. To start the story, I did not read the novel he is based on, but the script that underpins the film is something that was meant for children celebrating a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone who as old as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overflowed dialogues, it was usually spoken aloud. Greetings to the cameraman, at least he has tried to make something out of it. It is a pity that the film is lousy, if not, some scenes were certainly credible.
