I honestly had high expectations when I started watching this movie, but it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the tempo is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short). I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, she did it for several pages, filled it with a description and did not mean that people would read it one day, or it could pull and lose its appeal, what "Emma" most certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this error at a slow pace, but at least it had vivid lines that made up for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to bug # 2, that's the action, of course. I do not really care about everyone involved in this movie, but I'm sure they can do a good job, but I did not see much of it in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be funny, too hard to be "upper class", too hard to be British (some of them), so they all just act as heaps of actors and not as People appeared. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, was just an actor, not the people who played it. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people who played them were not so nice. Why do you all like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but behind her back she was a terrible gossip. If her friends were "ugly," she did not even bother to go behind her back. Why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make them laugh?" Of course the snob could not do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not change my mind exactly. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not care for them. I'm sure it's a nice book and all of them, but some books are not really meant for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
