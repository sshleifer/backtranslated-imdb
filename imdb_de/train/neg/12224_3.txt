Barbara Streisand leads and plays a major role in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> Babs enthusiastically disguises himself as a boy to get an education, which is not the hardest thing as she already looks like a boy anyway. In her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble believing that she is a type. <br /> <br /> Do not miss out on the many moments of unintentional humor when Babs' male friend considers her a man, but puts him on the ground, sits on top of him and lovingly looks him in the eye ... * giggle *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre movie; sparkling story about nothing particularly interesting.
