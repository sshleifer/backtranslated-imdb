You need to find out that if the name of the star in the opening balance is incorrectly listed, you will not be in the game long (the title is "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some nice car chases, shoot 'em up, blow them into action if EVERYTHING you want is action, because the relationship to the existing action is at best weak and absolutely unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially those of Gooding in the end, are worse than unbelievable, they are irrational if they are not hopelessly confused. All I can think is that Andy Cheng has to be a really nice guy to bring so many good actors into this disgusting project (he can not have anything at all, right?).
