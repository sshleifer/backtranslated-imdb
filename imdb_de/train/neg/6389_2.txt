I waited almost 25 years to see this movie. I thought it could be an undervalued work. From a historical animation the quality was not the same as it used to be. It played one of the best movie villains of all time, based on a popular series of children's books and was a production of Disney Studios. What could be wrong with that? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's posh score are the two saving graces of the film. The price is bad, and Mancini is more professional than the material earned. They bring class into a project that is otherwise overshadowed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the film, though filled with inappropriately adult situations, is still under a totally boring script, bland generic vocals, terrible songs and lazy animations that would not have been inappropriate in one of the Saturday morning television series from Disney's mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment for me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. An independent studio cost a fraction of it and produced a bit more creativity in its trailer than GMD in its endless running time. <br /> <br /> The extra star who does not make this "terrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
