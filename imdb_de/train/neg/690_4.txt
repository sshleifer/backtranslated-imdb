If you have ever seen a Slasher of the eighties, there is no reason to see this one. Originality is often not the strength of Slasher cinema, and this film is seriously lacking. There really is not much that can be said about pranks, so I'll do it quickly. The movie was one of the 74 movies on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a pile of children staying in a dorm at Christmas time. While they are in a Slasher, someone decides to shoot them down and this leads to one of the most boring secrets ever seen in a Slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre, because despite some bloody scenes, this movie is unlikely to spoil or spoil anyone, and leaner slashers than this (such as Friday the 13th) did not stop banning. On the other hand, there are forbidden films that are much less bloody than this (the witch who came from the sea). Anyway, closing the movie is the best part of it, as if the audience really did not care who the attacker was at the time. it is pretty well done. On the whole, this is a bleak and grim Slasher that even Slasher fans will miss well.
