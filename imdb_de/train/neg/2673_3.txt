Not long enough to determine the length of the feature and not abrupt enough to be short. This thing exists for a reason to have a lesbian trilogy. There are worse reasons to exist. A sad thing is that this could have made a decent movie. Misty fits in well with her outfit and is a very playful girl, and when people are so intrigued by a character like Lara Croft to make nude calendars out of her, you know a softcore movie explodes. Unfortunately, that's pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand, is air. Look at this, if you just can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a pretty blonde and has one man each, who is ever more angry.
