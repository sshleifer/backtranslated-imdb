This film is an attempt to introduce the theory of Jared Diamonds on "Guns, Germs and Steel" and explain how Europeans dominate much of the world. Std. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely pointless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond observing birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond not properly using bows and arrows, and Professor Jared Diamond firing a muzzle loader. Should this documentary from "Professor Jared Diamant" make a hero? This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a parody. The worst was when Diamond collapsed and cried while visiting the malaria ward in an African hospital. All this does not help me to understand his theory of Guns, Germs and Steel. By the way, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Can the Europeans cannons, germs and steel free them from this terrible situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally gets down to business, his theory is equally interesting and absolutely boring. The Europeans conquered the natives of other countries because they had weapons and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me? The parts of his theory that explain why the Europeans had the benefits of conquest are interesting, but the reporting is as thin as paper. <br /> <br /> In the end I think the documentary was just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are just as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I know that. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me with his awkward use of native devices. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the target audience for this documentary. But kids like it more than me. I've read that the book that this documentation comes from is much better than the documentation.
