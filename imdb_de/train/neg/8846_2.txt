In the installation of the Tower of Babel of the miniseries, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses." It's like saying George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great br /> <br /> Or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the arrow. <br /> <br /> Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> The authors of the greatest heroes of the Bible should at least have paid more attention to the chronologies of the biblical people and their events.
