This TV movie tells the story of extroverted Frannie, who suddenly returned to Silk Hope to visit friends and family without noticing her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but intends to sell it and move out with her new husband. Frannie strongly disagrees with the idea and promises to uphold the family heirloom by acquiring a job and assuming responsibility. And from that point on I somehow lost interest. <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett has more to offer than just fair hair and looks. It can be extremely convincing to a character when it comes to mind - and it is certainly here, as well as some of their earlier efforts, such as Extremities and Small Sacrificies, a great achievement by the legendary Charlie's Angel. Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never shies away from its cheap and happy television picture, and you know the budget was limited, but it's not the worst movie ever made. The positive aspects are there; You just have to find it.
