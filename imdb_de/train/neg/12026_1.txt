I really wish that people in a comedy tried to make fun of it. This is a movie that you can sit by, but nothing special. After seeing it, you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch, but the audience made no jokes to laugh about. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. History. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead he failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 out of 10 points.
