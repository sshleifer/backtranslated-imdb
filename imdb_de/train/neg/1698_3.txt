Lynch. The man has really great things! He knows how to bother us and rewards us by making us think in different ways. However, this is completely different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, which is earned by 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere in the fourth episode I just started to track the fast forward. Nothing missed I was relieved when it ended, and that's part of the story with this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, complete with annoying animations, voices and sound. But recognizing that and his other absurd qualities do not make Dumbland worthwhile.
