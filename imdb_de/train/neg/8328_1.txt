If you want to watch a movie that is strangely filmed and strangely lit, strange stories are about these men (and a woman) who enjoy breaking the crap if you want to enjoy a story that is nowhere to go One is a boxer and the other a gay man, then you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I felt almost as hurt as the director (of the movie) beat me to hell. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which one should not look for actions or great plays. This is a movie that you can star in horror and wonder. Like a plane crash or a train crash. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie, a good movie, a "B" movie, or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> A warning to all who see this movie. Please do not eat before. Maybe you want to puke until the end of the movie.
