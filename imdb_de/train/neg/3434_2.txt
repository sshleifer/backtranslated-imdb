I'm a big horror / splatter fan, I even like horror movies that some people think are stupid. I also like Gore. The more the better, as long as it makes sense. <br /> <br /> After reading the others' reviews on the website, I was sure this movie would be a little gem. But to my disappointment it was one of the most meaningless films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogue was stupid, the plot was useless, the special effects useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for 2 years. Normally, I find all these qualities make for a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I bought 11 EUR for this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you do not really enjoy a pointless gore (for example, the "violent movies"), avoid them at all costs!
