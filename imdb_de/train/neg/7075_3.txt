This is at least the third remake of this movie. So if you have a feeling of Deja Vu while watching, do not be surprised. All they did was change the story's setting and tell a different story, but the differences are not significant. And it does not get better because the plot is initially flawed. It never works. And like its predecessors, the spectacle is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen the movie before, but the end does not fit the story. If this movie had ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and would have been very satisfying, and I would have thought it worth more. But here is the spoiler and the crime in the end pays off, because the criminal is not caught. I never like this message resulting from a movie.
