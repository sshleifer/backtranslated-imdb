It might have been a morbid intriguing look at the life of one of America's most notorious serial killers, but unfortunately it does not even come close. Terrible editing, directing, bad acting, you name it. This movie is literally about 10 minutes long, the plot lasts 100 minutes. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as a father, but that's not enough to save that stinker. 1 out of 10 points
