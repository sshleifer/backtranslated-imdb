This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. He surpassed the previous horrible movie "Spawn of Slithis" I saw when I was about 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, daredevil and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, mixed cutscenes, even the music was annoying. Did I leave something out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI does not make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I actually spent money watching this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the director), please forward it to my username "at gmail". I will contact him to personally request a refund.
