I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title and then go through horror movies, I find it and I think "this is the title?" This movie is a kind of comeback movie from catastrophe film / insect attack with less notable stars. It is also a bit boring, as it has the television, in which the film for commercials and the like is hidden. The property has this type of resort that is occupied by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by building or something nearby, but do not quote me. The most memorable ant attack in the entire movie was for me the first to involve the boy who fell into the pool after being swarmed around, and of course the scene from Summers. What else is striking is the very stupid end, where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, like most TV movies, this film is very tame and not very scary, unless you panic at the sight of ants.
