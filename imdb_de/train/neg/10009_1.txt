This movie is a huge panty charge. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his bad script. And his direction is as weird as it can be without actually sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually like when properly staffed. He plays "The Walker", a homosexual man in D.C. He could not have been one-dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and hopped in front of the camera with an ice lolly. His "southern accent" is the off-the-shelf version that drops from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the south would still take away every ounce of energy. It is monotonous. But it's not the worst accent in the movie. His "friend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to influence a mid-east accent that is so awkward that he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is not able to roll his Rs even though he is German in real life and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! That's a good reason to occupy someone, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From storytelling to screenplay, directing, camerawork and lead performances, this film is bad from start to finish. The only bearable moments in the film came from three leading actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three have managed to survive the film with their dignity in time. In fact, all three are excellent, even though they are trapped in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, nobody could ever be good enough to fix this endless series of mistakes. If you like these three actresses, look at them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
