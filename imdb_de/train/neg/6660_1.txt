Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular trumps the mind. This show is not funny, not smart, not original, it's just a steamy pile of crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional idiots with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The speech could have been better. Then there is the animation. My God, it hurts when I just look at it. Everything is too shallow, too pointed, too bright and too sweet. Then there is the humor or lack of it. It is completely idiotic! They just take these class B jokes, which are not that weird at all, and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless potty humor that makes me sick. And finally the music. It's just annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotions. I wish there were less than 1 point, which I really do. This show must be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song, I immediately turn off the TV. If you have never seen this show, then not. Watch high-quality programs like The Simpsons or Futurama.
