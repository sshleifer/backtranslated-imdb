Suppose you have been on a desert island for the past ten years. I have not heard of Scream yet and left when Halloween part 1 came to the movies. Then this movie would have been an explosion and a whole new vision in the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At the moment, a rating of 2.7 is found on IMDb and does not deserve such low recognition. All in a nutshell, like "I know what you did" and a who's is that finally convinced me that and why. <br /> <br /> No big surprise, just a nice movie with coke, popcorn and no urge for a difficult plot, deep characters. If the video rental is among the top titles, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I have seen much worse.
