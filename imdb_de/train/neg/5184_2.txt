I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but was disappointed on many levels. First, the story is recycled so badly that it becomes almost unbearable. Second, the setting, the drama and the story are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many more good black performers than these standard picks. How about some originality? Third, very few hip-hop songs have been played, if at all. Nothing really seemed central. Overall, the movie was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and made the movie almost worthwhile.
