This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his comic life in the same period of 1989. The constant recognition of his hidden comic genius and his frustration with humorous material seems to come from Sandler rather than from the script. The movie is nothing compared to its blockbuster feature films like Big Daddy or even the crazy Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had yet found no way to express himself consistently, successfully and wittily in this film sequence, much like his character. Most of the "jokes" in the film come from Sandler's conversations with himself, usually because of his unrecognized comic talent and the beatings, because he's too ugly and can not get women. The film is also hard to see because it does not treat itself like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the movie, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately uncomfortable and embarrassing to see. I immediately forgot that I even saw this movie when it was over. Fearing that he would learn more about it would ruin Sandler's career. Give it in the video library, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
