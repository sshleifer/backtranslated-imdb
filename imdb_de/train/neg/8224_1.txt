Watch this movie? I thought, how much garbage. These girls have to have brains to even be part of it. A waste of time watching, poor sky, I only rented it. The spectacle was below average and the story was unbearable. If you plan to watch this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. I'm a real movie fan and that's worse than "Attack of the Green Tomatoes". <br /> <br /> I just hope that this garbage does not cost too much. The money would have been better spent for the homeless in the world. I just hope there is no continuation in the pipeline.
