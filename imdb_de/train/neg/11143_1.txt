Hello, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf coming to the shelves, I thought, "Hmm, simple and good name, at least, I wonder, why I have not heard of it before . "<br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with tits. Many tits. Tits are pretty much all that budgets for the budget. Who cares about a werewolf effect, pays the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br /> So about the mysterious Darkwolf character (a little spoiler in front of us, but who cares ...) He's your average everyday biker. Not even very tough-looking, but like the old wise woman in The movie says, "He's a lot more powerful and dangerous than you've ever seen before." I just described her as a tattooed biker guy. Pretty original. I had even looked twice when they used the "red glowing eyes" for the first time. I mean, my God, since the seventies, the Lets-Plant-Red-Dots-on-Eyes-with-Computer effect has been used. Here it just looks ugly! Do not get me with the werewolf 3D CGI. Like I said, like a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, how I like werewolf films, as I said. They always build their own werewolf legend. Darkwolf is also building the werewolf world, about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It begins almost immediately after the rules of engagement "the dark wolf kills anyone the girl has touched" are accidentally cut. That just does not make sense, why should we just explain the rules of killing, if they will not even play with them ... Besides, the shots are taken from the Wolf's point of view with a Sony Handycam or something, mostly filming the floor and the walls. Just add growling noises and you have a great werewolf effect. The Gore is partly fine. But if the wolf cuts everyone with an open hand by simply putting his hand on the victims, that does not do the trick for me ... <br /> <br /> WHO really gives the money money Make this bunch Rubbish directly on video horror tracks, they are not even funny like bad movies, just sad.
