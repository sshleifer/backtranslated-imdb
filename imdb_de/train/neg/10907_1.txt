I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I really liked. This guy, however, seemed to stop forever. It's one of those flicks that enjoys the sad placement of PG-13, but is not child-friendly. The jokes are not just jokes or bad jokes, they are rude and indecent, and many acts go beyond the limits not only of bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been cut off for the PG-13 rating ... too bad it might have made a bigger jump as an R-rated movie if the fun were left over. (Exaggeration? Probably.) Do not recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to show just about anything. After 45 minutes, the film felt it should cool down a bit ... and we were ready for it. The end is quaint, but does not save the rest of this swamp / tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a giveaway ... it would have been hard to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe)
