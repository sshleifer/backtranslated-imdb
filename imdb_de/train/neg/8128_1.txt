OK, do not be fooled by my summary. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was awful in a way people do not have to break their brains to describe it. But it is by no means worse than Manos: the hands of destiny, the hobgobblins, the horror of the Spider Island or a handful of movies. As a review, the movie is shit, it's awful. Do not see it without MST, or you may develop health problems. But there are worse films.
