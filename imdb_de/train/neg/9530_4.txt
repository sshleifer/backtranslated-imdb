I suppose that movie is based on a true story ... It's about two young girls bothering a grown man for 48 hours; I do not see where the horror comes in here ... There are some "weird" and "surreal" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... well) play the role of two psycho-man haters until they hit ... they do a pretty good job (though part of it is just a bit over the top) , I mean, this thing drips with the 70's ... It's not really that bad if you like something ... you know ... this thing?
