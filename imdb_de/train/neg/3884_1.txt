Many months ago, when I was seven, I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It appealed to my na√Øve curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. As wise adults that they are, they told me, "Absolutely not! It's a bunch of garbage." Of course I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid in my block to see the "Incredible Melting Man". <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a few days. I forgot "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years passed before it came to my fore again. While surfing through channels with digital cables, I found this long-lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was aroused and I decided to finally take part in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst movie you know. It makes films like Def-Con 4, Metalstorm and Freddie Got Fingered like Oscar nominees. I feel hurt because I've wasted nearly two hours of my life seeing that vile filth roughly for even 1977. How someone convinced a movie company to produce that movie beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. Listen to your parents if they have forbidden you to watch this movie. You were right.
