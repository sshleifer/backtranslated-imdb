2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" stick hostel, and 2006 gave us live feed; a not so decent rip off the hostel. Live Feed follows almost the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, except that the stupid kids are more in Asia this time than in Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid kids, and one of them has angered one of the locals so they are in trouble. The locals decide to lock them up in a theater and kill them all. Despite the fact that I had heard a few less-than-favorable things about this film before the film, I still hoped it would be at least halfway decent because director Ryan Nicholson had previously made the very decent 45-minute rape and revenge movie. " But this movie just falls off because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. The film obviously tries to fall back on the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel has successfully done), but it does not really come out. Surprisingly, Nicholson's previous work has been seen in special effects - not even the Gore is impressive ... although it's much better than acting! I can not say much else about this film ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
