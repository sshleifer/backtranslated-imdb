What a bad excuse for New Zealnd Movie Making. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander if this movie exists and is currently on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship is in real life one of the ferries between the islands that operate daily between the two main islands, and even the company logo (a dolphin) is still included in the entire set, including the funnel of the ship. The ship is said to be a cruise ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and age everywhere, but is said to be a luxury ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the New Zealand South Island in the background, for heaven's sake! It must have been a very cold time in the USA / Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the New Zealand / American accents just do not work. I assume that the New Zealand taxpayer has contributed to the film's production costs. This was a waste of money better spent on real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies on their cell phones. Goof: In the hold is a truck with markings, and they're sticking a Taco Company sign to the door of the truck, probably to make it look like it's American. But part of the sign is about tagging - you would think they noticed that in the prop department before you attach it. I would like to continue, but it is worthwhile in any way.
