This is the biggest insult for TMNT ever. Fortunately, Venus does not officially exist in Canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle who has been deprived of the tragic story of 4 male unique mutants who will never have their own family as soon as it no longer exists. The biggest mistake was crossing the Power Rangers to TMNT with a terrible episode. The turtle's voices were wrong and they all looked out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about these people ... it's damn worthy stuff. The lippatches looked slow and unnatural. they were totally neglected shredders. the main evil, a dragonlord type, was crazy. The turtles looked crazy, and the things hung on their bodies. What about that thing about Raph's thigh? the stupid looking sculptures!? <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, acted in the character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie comic sounds ... and better writing could have been good.
