Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Well, before a legion of cinopurists stifles their lats, may I go into more detail. As much as I enjoyed it, this is simply one of the worst films I've ever seen, and certainly the worst movie I've seen in the cinema (an impressive statement, remembering how I remember Daredevil on the big screen) Saw the screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were at best unconvincing and in the worst case terrible. Of course, they did not get a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and a characterization that was about as convincing as OJ's defense. The plot (to extend the term slightly) was thin to nonexistent, and the "Gore" scenes were undoubtedly brutal, but irrelevant and ridiculously formulaic. The plot is a roughly 20-year-old model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, detained and subjected to various forms of visual, mental and physical torture. The torture scenes look like disjointed set pieces, and the focus was on shocking rather than frightening the audience. While there are really very, very few positive points that can be drawn from this film, its redeeming features are the mistakes that make it such a terrible movie. I've never heard a more vocal audience in a movie theater. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was sewn and stayed that way. For my part, I came out full of laughter, borne by a movie that had risen to the climax of horrific filmmaking. However you look at it, this is really a cinematic accomplishment and a plan for future directors to describe in detail how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I did not mention that I managed to break into the movie ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still trying to get my money back ... it was really that bad.
