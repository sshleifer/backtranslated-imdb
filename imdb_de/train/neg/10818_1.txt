After reading the novel before watching this movie, I was enormously disappointed with the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard for the conspiracy. I find that this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work and rather gives the impression of a flat love story. When the film was condensed to short 2 hours, the film lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat erratic plot with little traction. The romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre is not structured, so this seems rather abrupt and unfounded, as the two characters interact so seldom that one can only imagine that their "love" is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel, one gets no idea of ​​Jane's quirky impudence and audacity that draws Rochester to himself, and his arrogance that Jane draws to him that some of the characters were very sharply presented, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however, the overall production was bad. For a better script, the movie might have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.
