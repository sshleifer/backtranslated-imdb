The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates and is then in a laboratory explosion (also set by them), in which his face is marked by acid. Years later, all the jerks are sent back to the Gymnasium for reunification. What they did not know is that Marty invites them to kill her. Then a storm starts, they are locked up in school and Marty starts to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid. The murders are imaginative and bloody and there are some scary shots of the abandoned school - but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he has moved out, dipped his head in a toilet AND is burned), and it is just uncomfortable to see. Considering that Scuddamore had committed suicide shortly after his release, they were barely visible. Also, this film does everything to have nudity. There is a complete front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie), but a girl decides to take a bath alone ... and then there is the couple who needs to have sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone is going to be and can teleport to them. It ends with a shoot that made me moan and twist my eyes, then another shot that made me want to throw something heavy on the TV! Acting is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is also there. She is a very beautiful woman, but not a great actress. <br /> <br /> This gets a 3 for some really bloody murders and atmosphere. Otherwise it is the mill and is unforgettable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide paid more attention to this film than it deserved.
