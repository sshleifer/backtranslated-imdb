I do not quite get the rating for the Amati girls and I think I was really nice and gave 4 out of 10 my eyes. There are so many clich√©s in this movie, women's hair is just horrible and most scenes are more than unrealistic or fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a number of actors who over-act the boundaries that hurt it. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too wrong to really get touched. It's just not good in my eyes. When I saw it, I could not believe how it got to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it was still OK and it just got lost in the translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I have ever seen and certainly not in a good way! We are sorry.
