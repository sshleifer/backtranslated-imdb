Cliff Robertson, a scheming husband married to a wealthy woman, is a raid-worthy performer here, if there is one; It's as if director Michael Anderson kept shouting "pick him down, think zombie, just less vividly" through his little megaphone as he trains Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is hardly better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN is hardly to be seen in the role that should have been worked out as a key role. If the quality of the drama was three times better; when some of the gaping plots were filled; and if the pace was adrenaline-pumped, this Yawner could be set to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark \ Lifetime TV channels. The rating is so inexplicably high that one does not have to believe that chronic insomnia patients use DOMINIQUE to calm down a bit. Maybe late night telemarketers on television lack a great opportunity not to give them away as such.
