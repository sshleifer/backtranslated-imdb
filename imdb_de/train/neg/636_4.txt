A few farmers fight in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys his future wife O-Lan, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the lead roles, speaking with false accents and emphasizing ancient clich√©s and patriarchal ideology. A good woman, many children and land are the best things for men. They are considered property and investment. Because it's a big budget movie, where lots of extras work together, big sets are built, and special effects are made, filmmakers can not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer received an Oscar for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the film. Her steady face forms a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni performs better and shows his talents again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems Franklin did not know when to finish the picture. This film could be dangerous if it is considered a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
