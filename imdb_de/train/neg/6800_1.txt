I just signed up to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. In addition to being a rip-off in Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other terrorist story, it's the kind of movie that makes you appreciate a movie that has the same basic ideas and works well. It's hard to blame the actors for providing such a dumb, clich√©d script. It's bad enough once you moan in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence. However, if you groan over and over again, you may find that the director is not the best bulb in the movie business, the producers who have decided to bring this story to the screen at all. The most inexpensive actors can excuse you for undertaking this assignment because they most likely have turned up to gain money and publicity, not that part of this movie joke will earn them prizes or awards. They may end up being embarrassed because they have such a bad judgment to get involved in such a loser. I do not see any point in summarizing the plot or even giving examples to prove my case, because that would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one could resist who was involved in this debacle. Just as studying well-made films can inspire you to create a good, artfully crafted piece of art and beauty, just by watching this monstrosity, you can learn what NOT to do and what does NOT work! Be warned.
