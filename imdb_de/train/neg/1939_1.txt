Come on! Disappear with the Pakistani Pakistanis. Not only can Bollywood make brilliant films, it can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm a huge Bollywood fan. But anti-Pakistan movies just make me cringe too much to enjoy script, cinematography and action sequences - everything. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na that have done brilliantly, not just because they deserve it for quality his Bollywood masala, but also because she's trying to say: Give peace a chance and show that there are insane people on both sides who do not represent the masses.
