This is a cruel movie. Two denied young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away when it comes to a plot or "spoiler". I would just say that the end is almost the most absurd part of the strip. The film is largely about Locke and Camp clucking obnoxiously and grinning psychologically in front of the camera. Add a soundtrack that repeats itself over and over again, including a Vaudevillian song about "Dear Old Father," which suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never really sees. The music is initially annoying and ends up with a torture worse than that shown on screen. The theme here is Youth Amok, understandable in response to the '60s, but with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
