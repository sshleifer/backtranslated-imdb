The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is that the option to give zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I've ever experienced. For about 75 minutes, you are the WORST theatrical actor (and I do not mean that well, as with KILLER NERD, who had a great terrible acting) and an act that is not only ridiculous, but also has nothing to do with a massacre. The reason why I leased this piece of crap was that there is a massacre in the title. That said, there was only one murder in the entire movie, and that was pretty lame. They spend more time watching the kids fight and do gardening than anything else. Speaking of children, the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since he came from a cemetery home. Did I mention that it was also shot on video? If you want to throw away money and more than an hour of your life, then take a look at it. But if you enjoy your hard-earned money and your time, then sprinkle it as much as possible.
