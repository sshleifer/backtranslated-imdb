If Barry Diamond and Art Evans had not acted as clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a 10-year high school reunion that takes place in a supposedly deserted high school (looks more like a prop from a low-budget horror movie of the fifties), and the confused one Pupils of the class started a very traumatic prank. This student wants to kill the entire class in revenge. John Hughes falls in love with his characters as only one student is killed, as is the Lunch Lady (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We believe that the horny couple gets killed but never see a damned thing! This is a terrible movie that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon in the 80's and 90's.
