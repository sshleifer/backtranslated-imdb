With this film Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the power of the film, while he clearly states in the film that his work is "objectivity". Of course it is not like that. For one reason, many scenes shot "by accident" are obvious settings (if that poor goat "accidentally" falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). On the other hand, hiding some important information: The Hurdes people were for a reason, as indicated in the film, as they were. This is goiter, a disease caused by iodine deficiency (salt). This goiter is the cause of their cretinism, and if Bunuel had just taken the time to investigate (damn if he had searched for a "medical cretinism" in a medical dictionary, found "goiter"), he might have told the truth to these people (still doubtful). Instead, he constantly judges her with his film and talks to her again and again as "Cretins", dramatizing the plot, setting up scenes to create the spectacle. All of this is very unacceptable to a documentarian who claims to be working for a movie. Bunuel talks all the time in this movie and does not say a word to the people he's filming. He speaks for her and even she judges her. This piece is flawed at the roots, at the ideology and it is a pity that it is a great movie.
