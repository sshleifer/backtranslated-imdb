Under the dense green glow of computer graphics gleamed the amazing art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Unfortunately: it has lost in all the Goo. The scenes of Old Edo - with the courtesan floating on Sumida, practicing and trading in Nakamura-za - were all exciting and captivating, taking you back to an interesting and rich time. The action on the Kabuki stage, where Somegoro excels and excites, was more rewarding than the absurd high jokes that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience and the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over the storyline and the performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors alive and he loses himself in the dirt.
