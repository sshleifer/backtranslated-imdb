This is absurd - apart from the Australian colleagues who have reviewed this film, I can not help but believe that everyone else who has submitted a review so far has been involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they are were with their praise. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of comic book-to-movie conversions, so I did not raise much expectations, but still I found Elektra incredibly indescribable. The thing that annoyed me most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film that was not clarified, which made you think, "What relevance does that have for the plot?" or "how did this aspect of the figure come about?" I can only hope that these are things that may be explained in Daredevil, something I do not want to see. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters' behavior in this film seems to be an impetus to coincidental moments that fit the plot, and does not even start me with the absolutely pointless romantic subplot. I scratched (still) about the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, who seems to be unclear. <br /> <br /> If I can give praise to this film for whatever it wants, then it must be The fantastic locations that were filmed, but otherwise I had little fun with Elektra. I know we're supposed to expose our unbelief to fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even for action movie standards) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> At least Jennifer Garner looks damned good.
