What was the F * @ # that I just saw? Steven STOP !! You're welcome! This movie is insatiable bad and stupid. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (apparently) wish-they-were-vampire-like creatures with superhuman strength. OK? Oh, and her eyes blink inhumanly? Impressive! But even in this movie, to suppress Seagals, if you have the final punch and no kick-my-a-$$ ego, he's somehow stronger than you. But all average people are crushed all around him. Come on, I can understand the big bully or drug dealer in the neighborhood, but these are superhuman people. Do you understand that? Seagal goes through a bit of identity problems because he and his cohorts seem to think he's a glutton! Oh my GO ... and worse than all that! Yes, there are worse things. He has a voice, even if the voice changes in the middle of a sentence while we look at his face. They obviously do not sound like him and I think it could be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watch a movie. This is an all-time low, even for your direct movies to Steven. Dreadful! Dreadful! Dreadful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well, I think so, I will be fair in this regard. At least some of the special effects were fine, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women were all very attractive in the IMO. Nevertheless, and I said STILL, it does not make the crass X-Men, Underworld (add your favorite zombie or vampire movie here) rip off! The director, author, producer, ALL should be banned from the film business. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost all the other Uwe Boll images) about this movie. That's my whole $ 1.00 for this movie. See if you dare.
