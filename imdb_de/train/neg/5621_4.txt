I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic, so I expected to enjoy this movie. After watching, however, I honestly believe that I could have done a better documentation myself. His arguments seem to have only four spurious sources (although he was not listed in the credits on IMDb, I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), he has been roughly edited along with ridiculously amateurish computer effects, and does not seem the least impartial. The narrative is infused with a sneering, almost youthful, anti-Christian sentiment that nullifies the possibility that the film actually changes a person's opinion, as opposed to a sermon before the choir (ie, H. Mir). Although there are some interesting discussions about the historicity of Jesus, the film encounters an unbearable snag as he begins to outnumber the Christian school that the director visited as a child, an institution that has apparently seriously injured him psychologically, because he possessed him to day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still the opportunity to intelligently comment on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical religious documentaries on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director decided to insult our intelligence with this trash, which ultimately represents a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian upbringing has traumatized him, but he does not have to subject an audience to his coping mechanism.
