I remember this movie when I was 13 (many reviews say the same thing as AGE 13!) With a group of schoolmates. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie and we were interested in the typical advertisements that told us this was a great comedy. We suffered about 45 minutes of it and we all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from the ability of Billy Crystal to make us laugh, we did not laugh. I accidentally came across this review and decided to sign up to let the rest of the world know what a hell of a waste of film this was. If you rent this now, you deserve what you get, you have been warned !!
