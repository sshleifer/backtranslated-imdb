This movie is simply not worth the time. Their confidence in New Age mysticism serves as the only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> I was just asked to even spend the time to comment as I noticed that some have tried to support the reputation of this cause. Their motivation and objectivity are dubious as they encourage you not to look at the flaws of the film, but to the well-intentioned message of New Age consciousness or Islamic fundamentalists to input positive reviews about movies / television that their views support? Despite the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any supposed historical basis? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the devotees will come right behind me to tell you, despite the truth, flowery things about this movie.
