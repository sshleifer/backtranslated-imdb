I'm not a big fan of horror movies and have only seen a handful of them (and not the "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth" s) - but I can not appreciate a terrifying horror movie for bruising. And I'm pretty sure that's not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so scary about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all his performances there are distant settings, which is why there is no surprise in this movie. (Not that a skull is so scary in itself, but ... The plot concerns Claus von BÃ¼low's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna Reed equivalent (Peggey Webber, one of the worst performances ever), the skulls I hear that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning case OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it, this is the same old one Conspiracy over a rich kid trying to kill his wife and / or drive him crazy If you want to see a well made version of it, try "Reversal of Fortune." By the way, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson . <br /> <br /> The MSTing was okay, but nothing special, but coupled with the short "Gumby" it makes for a good ad. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; Eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> To tell Mr Von Bulow, "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
