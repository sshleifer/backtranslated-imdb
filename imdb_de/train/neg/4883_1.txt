During the auspicious beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II, which was filmed in a video, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately it was like that. The story itself is very simple. Ethel, a murderous maniac with an eating disorder, is discharged into halfway home for overcrowding the hospitals. She is by far the most sensible resident who watches as one man lays dead flies in someone else's soup. Ethel is then teased with a chocolate bar by one of the half-domestic workers after he has gone to the cost-cutting measure of feeding the dog food to the residents. Ethel takes revenge by strangling him with a wire loop on the stairs, and then ... well, you have the idea. If all this sounds like fun, it's not like that. This movie was done badly with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should stand in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half the film is flashback to the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a little better. A very bad effort.
