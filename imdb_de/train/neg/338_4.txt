Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's less-funny films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three-hundred-year-old dragon, and a "Chosen One." The opening song suggests he is "the best man in the world." As a finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is "The Chosen One" and that his destiny is to find and rescue "The Golden Child". For if the child died, pity would die for him, for it is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all that hocus-pocus rubbish does not ruin him now, he'll surely film it for now. Suffice to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the entire movie. Another carrier for Murphy's selfish humor (the comedy is not great), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the process. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
