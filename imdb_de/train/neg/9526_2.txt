When I rented videos for free, I included this one here. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was rude and unnecessary. 2: There's some sort of soundtrack in the background of the movie that seems to be there all the time, and the way I felt for days after seeing that garbage, I realized there was something subliminal in the track , Either that or it was just traumatically bad or both. Throughout the movie you can often find that the author and director did not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about acting.
