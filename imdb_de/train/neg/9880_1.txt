I saw this movie at the first theatrical release, in a quite empty theater. Believe it or not, after watching movies for decades, this movie still seems to me to be the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would look at. <br /> <br /> The acting is far below the standard that was torn off the street by any group of drunken high school students and forced to study their lines 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of unbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene reached new lows. But after a while this dubious pleasure subsided and it became really sad.
