Average viewers looking for a sense of inner coherence in a movie should probably pass the movie. It creates the same feeling as if one were staring at a strange series of single frames that seem to have a relationship to each other but never merge into a totality. <br /> <br /> While this isolative approach creates a kind of cinematic montage, it may appeal to some students or critics who are familiar with the inner language of contemporary filmmaking. It is completely irritating and condescending for us citizens who have just fallen from the hay cart. Obviously avoiding accessibility may be the deliberate hallmark of Auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me it does happen when Andy Warhol has warmed up. The only salvation that I find is in the production values, and they just will not cut it alone. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions where you watch and listen and anxiously wait and in vain for a skilful development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful single scenes. We are sorry. The calligraphic credits begin to roll unexpectedly as soon as your interest awakens. I get the same yawning and disappointed reading, what I think are very knowledgeable and thorough comments on this film that never lead to anything truly intelligible. Ideas and images without external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a Philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of Chop Suey. <br /> <br />
