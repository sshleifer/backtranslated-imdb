The genre of suspense movies really makes a leap in these. The big problem is the IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that will lead to excitement and a tense feeling of what will happen next, but this film was so predictable and simply unbelievable. I think the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I tell things to the actors to protect them from dangers. Making bad decisions all the time means just being stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, maybe I would have enjoyed it a bit. After saying that, it is better to stay away from it.
