... is the only way to describe this movie about topics that should be foolproof: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst grins at her role as silent film star Marion Davies, as if she thinks she's in Legally Blonde. The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst has an over-current effect to the point where you want to grab the screen. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except that he plays Charlie Chaplin and about 125 pounds is too heavy for the role? Hard to believe that this unkempt wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but he also did not shoot a movie in which? 30 years? Sometimes you just do not come back.
