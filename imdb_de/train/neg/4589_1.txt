Do you remember the chain-smoking channeler that was exposed to 60 minutes a few years ago? That is her. Many people rated this film without checking the credibility of the filmmakers. The manufacturers have used fake "word of mouth" promotions very successfully without providing the financial and philosophical foundations for this marketing trip. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age muck and one-day nonsense, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a Wacko, so give her a pile of money. If you can tiptoe on the Ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then you may think that the money you dropped on the infomercial because of this madness was well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
