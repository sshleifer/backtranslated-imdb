One wonders why this image was ever made: the plot as such is absolutely unbelievable, if not ridiculous, the characters (experienced loner versus younger, rather intrigued) quite predictable, the end completely dull and impossible to understand (possibly after several visits ) But for that you would have to have a masochistic tendency. You need to read the book to fully understand what it's about. And acting is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to have the Americans in the genre "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If so, it is a total failure. However, it has been quite successful (and has some cult status as the first French serial killer movie), and it seems to be considered a good export product. Strange.
