I hate casting such lines, but in that case, I feel like I have to: The American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in cinemas in the last five years. There I said it. And now that I've got that out of my system, please let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in a powerful rage, a curse is born, the curse gathers in that place Death." Those who meet him are consumed by his anger. "That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I admit, it sounds fascinating. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not continue. Those who come across the "curse" are in fact consumed by their anger and that's all you get. Would like more? Well, too stupid. Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE only serves to scare you. The problem is that if there is no act of which one can speak, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, who draws a George Sluizer and recreates his own original films, bravely tries to build atmosphere in the first hour? by repeating the same scene over and over again. It unfolds pretty much as follows: <br /> <br /> -Person goes to the house <br /> <br /> -something flashes through the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> < br /> person goes to the examination <br /> <br /> sound starts to sound loud <br /> <br /> person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> louder screams and / or cat cry /> <br /> -cut to black <br /> <br /> Before the audience even gets a plot of the plot, the same scenario unfolds in the first hour. The first time was actually a bit scary. Any further use became ridiculous in the course of the film. When the movie ended, my friend and I wondered if this scene would end with "a loud scream and a black cut". We have never proved wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has no liner story, but unfolds in a series of vignettes that confuse the audience. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling if done right. The movie jumps from time to time without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie in such a state since opening the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. This storytelling technique holds every secret that the movie could possibly have. If you already know that the spirits scared two characters to death, how shocked is it when their bodies are in the attic? And why would we mind if a detective tries to clear up the mysterious disappearance, if we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> The American version of THE RING has obviously the second weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation, which is disguised as a real movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that they earned $ 40 million on the first weekend, and some people think it's the "scariest movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who are fed up with the anger of paying to watch THE GRUDGE.
