I was thrilled to see this movie, expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons," which is the dream of every male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft core Cinemax movie that does not change your life. There is only one hot sex scene on a roof, but that's it. I looked at it a long time ago, but trust me, this is just a normal boring softcore movie. <br /> <br /> The women are hot, but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to observe this only when it is broadcast via cable.
