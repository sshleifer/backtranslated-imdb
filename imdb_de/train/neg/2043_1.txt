Terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> A condescending remark at the beginning and a few nasty autopsy photos do not make a good movie. Once again, I am amazed at the determination and skill of some people to get a movie production, yet they are not proud to realize that what they've done is a bunch of crap. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a redemptive function so that I could at least make up for my criticism, but all I could think about was that Pink's opening track was pretty good ... I wonder if she saw that? <br /> <br /> See this at your peril, boredom can kill you.
