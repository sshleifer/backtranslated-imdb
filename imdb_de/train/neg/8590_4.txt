Ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into a shaky brat The 19-year-old Annakin, Amidala, 5 years older, kind of irritates. Well, 22-year-old Jedi warrior Annakin has some bad dreams and so has to slaughter children, his friends, and the whole gamut of his existence because a crazy old man has convinced him. A) His precious wife could really die and b) only he can prevent that. Ludicrosity squares. <br /> <br /> I think people who like this movie are not careful. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally not the perverted sense of "fantastic," "wonderful," etc.). Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and friendly anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he chops off Annakin's legs, makes him burn in the lava and makes him suffer. Does not someone think that has a little character? Not to mention that it was pretty stupid to risk a life, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> At least I had expected a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motives. None of this here. The story could have been written by a 10-year-old. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is pretty cool.
