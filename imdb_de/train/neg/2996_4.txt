Born Again is an episode from the first season. It deals with the topic of reincarnation and just does not fly. I've never been great at reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy to this episode. It refers to the Tooms case, which is a nice continuation of the previous episode. But the positive ends there. Which is unfortunate, because that happens at the beginning of the episode. I find it ridiculous that a dead man would choose to be reborn in the body of a totally unrelated girl. And he waits until the girl is careful to take revenge. There is even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogues to keep the episode afloat. If you are interested in reincarnation, this episode may be in your alley. If not, then you can at least learn what bradycardia is.
