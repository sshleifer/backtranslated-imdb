I completely agree with another reviewer who was pleased that "For The Birds" won the Best Animated Short Oscar in 2002. Belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but also many animated shorts. By the way, I love dark humor, but that was unsightly from the beginning. <br /> <br /> To the story here: A guy who walks around and is surrounded by nothing but gray (here symbolism) is told by a TV (which appears every few hundred yards away) that he is either in the Heaven, hell or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I think that would be funny in two of the three cases.
