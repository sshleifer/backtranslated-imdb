Although 99.99% of the people who watched this movie are Brazilians, I will keep up with English, as it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. Worst acting I have seen in a long time. The kids are terrible. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw someone with less expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger and had a single tone, like a five-year-old boy reading in front of the class. How can someone be so bad the lead actor of a movie? The story is so shallow that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It's so easy that you can write it in a napkin and say it in three minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three ways you like this movie: 1) you are a teenager; 2) You've been brainwashed by Globo's stupidity so you think everything the seal of the globe has is great. 3) You have a severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A shame for the Brazilian film scene.
