I am not an artistically inclined person. I'm a science-minded woman and felt like this movie might be one of those campy-like movies on a budget. I saw part of it with my fiancé and future stepdaughter. We made a great effort to find something in this film to protect our interest. My fiancé and daughter tuned out and we went to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. In order not to be deterred, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started watching this movie seriously. I just did not get it, I thought I would get it. I thought the funniest part was the rinsing of the ashes and the urn that found a place by the fireplace that served as a vase for seemingly dead flowers. Interesting and still it had dead stuff in it. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they were looking for, but I'm not being tricked a second time!
