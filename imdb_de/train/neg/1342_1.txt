This film is the beginner project of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from some problems, as is the case with any low budget production, it is a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her business and every Friday, the 13th since the 2nd part. But the ideas are from the heart. With so many great films, the actors only run through the moves, it's always nice to see actors really trying to improve their craft. The story is about the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are bound to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a cruel stalker called "The Bagman". Who will survive? You must pay attention. <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or a number of arrogant critics, you probably should not bother. But if you'd rather approach Joe Bob Briggs and see a group of people refining their craft, then check out The Bagman.
