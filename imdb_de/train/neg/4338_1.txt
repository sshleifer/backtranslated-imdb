really horrible ... main actor has done OK ... the movie, the plot, etc. was completely crap and inaccurate, it could have been a sequel ... anything that had little or no relevance to Carlito's way ... and should be avoided like the plague of Carlito's road guards ... no mention of Gail, in fact he ends up with another bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail , They tried to make it like the original with flashbacks at the beginning ... but to be honest, when I rated it, I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to make money on one of the best movies of the 90s ... in total it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life that I wasted on all the "action" in this movie. it was really boring slow and predictable ... again, to avoid Carltio's Way fans, this fiasco ...
