I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony of recent years 2003 has taken place for two reasons: Host Steve Martin was the funniest: "I've seen teammate Michael Moore in the Helped his father's trunk limo "and" I will not mention the gay mafia better, if I wake up with a poodle head in my bed. "Surprise winner: Nobody had Adrien Brody as Best Actor (Genuine Cheers) or Roman Polanski as Best Director ( Real Guys and Boos), but they won. <br /> <br /> The award last year was not that bad, but there were few surprises and I was glad to see RETURN OF THE KING overtook the prices, even if it was not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what the BBC's coverage lowered was that Jonathan Ross got some of his sycophant colleagues and acted as if they were funny when they were something. When I heard that Sky was broadcasting coverage for British television, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make the links, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh God, when British television desperately looks for movie critics (Obviously they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will like to fly to LA to share their honest opinions on the winners and losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not so bad, but he is not Steve Martin, while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seating! In my opinion, not exactly a dazzling arena. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "small" Oscars distributed to the winners sitting in their seats! There is no "small" Oscar and just because of the award for "Best Animated Short" or "Best Costume Design", they are as well deserved as "Best Film" or "Best Director". All winners should be allowed to go to the podium. What a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy will be, and I agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful, and if the surprises were not, this could have been the worst ceremony in history. As for the awards themselves. <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. Not a big surprise for a competitive class <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints, as Freeman is one of America's largest living character actors. <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. Predictable price of the night. Yawning <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Big surprise, as everyone thought Annette Benning would simply champion the academy policy, but Swank deserved it and made the best speech of the night. <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise as everyone thought Scorsese would get the prize simply because he had never won one. Actually, I'm glad about it, because if he had not earned it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he would not have deserved it for THE AVIATOR. <br /> <br /> Best Movie - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Yet another big surprise, as everyone thought the academy would split the Best Director and Best Picture awards, while I felt that THE AVIATOR's Hollywood plot made Best Picture an absolute bestseller While the controversial topic of the MDB would have become a lot of voters out of <br /> <br /> What these prices might illustrate is that voters this year have decided to ignore the Oscar policy and people who deserve it have to lend prizes that they have not earned in the past BEAUTIFUL REPRESENTATION WHICH THE GUTACHSHIP OF THE RING will beat for heaven's sake! And for a long time the academy can choose with their heads instead of their hearts
