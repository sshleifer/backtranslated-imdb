Adrianne, should really have a life - without Mr. Brady. She annoys me and was one of the main reasons why I know I can get involved in the show longer. It's a pretty mindless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to fall under the frames and be analyzed to death. That makes them look / sound, they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet we know that these disagreements are part of life. I think that is entertainment for some people. If this falls into the next season, I'll be sorry for those who have nothing better to do with their lives than to look at this garbage. Nevertheless, I would not be very surprised. I can not stand the ads for this show! I hope they get enough money to embarrass themselves week after week in front of a camera. However, the "A" girl has a big butt!
