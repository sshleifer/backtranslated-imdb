This sci-fi adventure is not the best and not the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is funny. Bizarre pinks and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late, late and late show viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other weird creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Performers include Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Make yourself comfortable and enjoy it. Do not feel bad if you nod for a moment. I agree to include this in the list of cult classics that you should not miss.
