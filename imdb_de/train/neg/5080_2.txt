This is a review by The Wizard, which should not be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a late-'80s film about the ability of a seriously quiet boy to play and run video games throughout the opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update from The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who put together 100 straws and had some kids drinks. <br /> <br /> Now that we have it all out of the way, let me say this: There is really no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo commercial designed to use the Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3 crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and a man with less sense of style than mine Grandmother. If the author and the director did sit together and actually play some games together, they might realize that they were filming garbage altogether and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car radios. I hope that this was a revealing experience for you. It certainly was not for me. I think I might have lost a few fantasies when I saw this movie and wrote about it. Next time you're in the video library, and the Wizard, the Wizard, and the Wizard of Oz are sitting in a nice little row on the shelf, give them all a mistake and play Duck Hunt instead.
