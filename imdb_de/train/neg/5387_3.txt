In a moment when it seemed interesting, it was never there. <br /> <br /> People are going from one point to another, with no point (if there was one, it was very boring). There was no action, excitement or horror and the characters were pretty heartless, so it did not matter what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that it was not shaky, choppy camera work and when there was music, it did not bother me like some really bad movies and the acting was not terrible.
