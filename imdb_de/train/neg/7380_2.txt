I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all of his direct releases appear in recent years compared to his stunning hits of the early '90s. <br /> <br /> A secret biolab is making a new kind of drug that will make a new impact on people's adrenaline system to the point of turning them into psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal should stop the infection or be the end of the world ... or something. Seagal also went through hitpads like jellybeans. Every time I looked up, he had a new face. Therefore, it was hard to follow the character development. I know Steven Athsma prevents him from screaming out of his lungs, but why is that? He is constantly being synchronized by people who do not listen to him? In general, movie sequences and action sequences can save time wasters, but this was not even close. As I said earlier, it was more of a horror film that pierced a lot of blood and thighs instead of fighting directly. The problem was not really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people had the speed of light, but the 40-year-old 200 kg Seagal killed them all alone? I think the only highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes when the new recruits asked Seagal to come with them to the Strip Club. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
