Undoubtedly, Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, and yet retains a liking in my heart as the special effects and the amazingly awful soundtrack are seen in the first 15 minutes (and, frankly, everything you need) combine to create something that is hilariously juxtaposed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in 'Space' is almost as unfathomable as cinematography, like bottles of dish soap passing by your eyes. Before you had time to find out if you've gone crazy, roll the credits and fight the action to life. <br /> <br /> And aside from the double-headed giant snail that terrorizes our heroes, you also receive double the bonus if you have both the original actor voices and the voices synchronized at the same time. Ingeniously pure. <br /> <br /> For the fans of this kind of fare, the sad thing is that I only saw one copy. The probability of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Maybe I own the only copy. <br /> <br />
