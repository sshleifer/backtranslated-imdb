What is to like about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> There is impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic music note in the background that sometimes works well! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is accelerated! Especially if the shark or the bad guys are about to move in! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! As if to convey it to the audience, it's time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> As another bites the dust! Like in a "spaghetti western" this has a lot in common with! <br /> <br /> It's not that the Italians can not produce quality productions! There were a number of television films with a headline such as "Octopus" (numbers 1 to 7), which ran on Mafia conflicts on Australian television from SBS TV in the 1990s. And they were excellent! But unfortunately you can not find it here! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was made around 1960! Unfortunately, it was 20 years outdated, as a funeral scene proves in the end. <br /> <br /> Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the brisk shark, which causes a red dust, which appears again and again in the bluish water! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everything, either in a brawl in the barroom or watching the recent bloody oceanic demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the hero's buddy looks worried through his glasses, too. He was bored in his relentless role in the midst of lack of evidence for the conspiracy or character development of another! <br /> <br /> At least the hero gives a belated concern to his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But even if the music does not awaken our cognition, we have the eerie sound in the voices of the bad guys, as if they nudge us that another dark act is emerging! <br /> <br /> And in the end someone thought of a turn! Just when we thought it was absolutely predictable! But stay tuned, people, because maybe you'll find another twist! If you look carefully! Warm up your heart more or less! <br /> <br /> Follow the advice of the hero and drink some beer along the way! This makes your viewing of "Night of the Sharks" even more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you're ready for something like a "007" movie to bring you back to reality when that's over !!!
