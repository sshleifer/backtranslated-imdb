"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Performers: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (for some rough action and rough humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you want (I know some people who despise it without end), but I've always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" is a funny movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but still a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man - sometimes irritating, yes, and massively overrated, but funny, by a young audience that practically adores him. There was rarely a Jack Black comedy I did not enjoy to a degree. I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite," and Jack Black teamed up for a movie about a Spanish brother who is becoming a wrestler to rescue an orphanage. My only reservation was that the action seemed a bit too thin. Unfortunately, my only reservation proved to be the downfall of the entire movie. If it had served as a sketch on some shows like "Saturday Night Live" or possibly even "Mad TV", that would have worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the plot is way too thin in the approximately one and a half hour runtime and this one joke comedy falls flat. Nacho was educated in a Mexican monastery and became a pious man of the Lord. Nacho (Black), now the convent's cook, feels shunned by the entire convent and decides to follow his dreams of becoming a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances have reached an all-time low, Nacho chooses a wrestling tournament so he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This action sounds so sweet and caring. It seems to be the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with School of Rock. Well, to my displeasure, this conspiracy is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that simply takes away the heart of the movie. It's Hollywood's way to show that they feel that the young audience can only understand fart jokes and stupid humor. Of course, what I know is perhaps the general idea of ​​teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. If you see an obese woman scurrying across the floor like a mouse, you will surely be made to laugh. However, do not expect to receive an award for putting them in your film. A seven-year-old could make the same joke. <br /> <br /> The services in "Nacho Libre" are really good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely funny and can even make the most stupid, worthless lines that ever seem funny on paper. Unfortunately this movie was not enough for him. There was nothing to keep him going and the only reason one of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that she is not only very talented, but also one of the most beautiful women who have ever graced my eyesight. She simply clicked on the scroll and it worked wonderfully. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nachos Hummelpartner Esqueleto, kept making me laugh. He did a great job and it was very effective when he partnered with Jack Blacks. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast has done its job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a below-average film. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" just does not work. His plot is too thin stretched. The heart of all this is polluted by moronic humor and disgusting jokes that simply do not work. I've rarely laughed and if, then because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the beautiful side of "Nacho Libre": Yes, the cast. This cast was only good, for lack of a better word they were up. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry and pumped as much life into the flat script as possible. After Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" had thoroughly entertained me throughout the movie, I was surprised that I was so bored with "Nacho Libre". Something has been lost here and I do not yet have to understand what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet is totally worthless because of its cast. There's a small reason to watch, if only Jack Black watches at work. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I'm done with this movie and this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess' surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 4/10 (C +)
