I missed the beginning of this movie, which might be why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, for years I studied the case of the Roman Republic, so I know the story. That could be the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they have tried to get it right, it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that sometimes they put in a lot of effort to be historically correct, so they end up becoming confusing. Like throwing Antony's marriage to Octavia and pushing her aside two scenes later. Why should it even be addressed if it has no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never seen? And as he called Antonius in some scenes with his real name (Marcus Antonius) and in other scenes with his strange English name Mark Antony. <br /> <br /> Although historical inaccuracies have been left aside, the film could still have been a fun watch if it was not the lead actress. There is not an ounce in her. She is hysterical, dramatic and has no control over herself. Instead of being a smart and laid-back queen, Cleopatra transforms into a hysterical teenager with a bad PMS. 95% comes from poor actors, but 5% from bad screenwriting. Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not look Antony and Cleopatra, you looked at immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something from this time, look ... anything but this.
