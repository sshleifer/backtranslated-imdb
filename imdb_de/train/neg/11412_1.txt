This movie is so bad that you can not imagine. The drama is terrible, even worse than soap operas of the third grade. And it is a shame that this film was the most successful in Switzerland in the last 20 years. The interactions between the soldiers made no sense at all. The story could have been taken out of a Bravo photo story, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard, and the storylines were larger than the black hole in the center of our galaxy. However, today it does not take much to satisfy the audience. The actors were handsome, for example the former Miss Switzerland, and the main character was even hung up (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. This is a really cool man! Especially for 12- and 13-year-olds. But the media created an atmosphere in which one should not refuse the film because they manipulated the peer-group dynamics by implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you are not with the other "sheep" and "yes" say exactly how it was when I was in the army / that's what I'll do when I go to the army ... to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness. And do not think that I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I had to do because I insulted a lieutenant). It is not necessary that every movie is sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to talk for a few hours and forget about problems, and I think that's not a bad thing. But these kinds of films really affect young people by showing them a cool lifestyle that is really just stupid and makes them mindless, ignorant and self-centered idiots. But since I will be quiet now that my opinion is not very popular, I recommend you avoid this horrible movie at any cost and save your mind! <br /> <br />> <br /> (Sorry for my bad english)
