It can not be described in words how totally terrible this movie is. It's a series of random, fun-loving clips about everything, from a stupid Batman parody to a guy who lets go of it with an old dead lady (really very disturbing). The only funniest thing about the underground comedy movie is Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. It is also rated NC-17, which cuts off the only people who could tolerate it.
