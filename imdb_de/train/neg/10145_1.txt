Steven Seagal seems to be walking through a horrible movie that was shot almost completely in close-up to cover up the lack of budget and resources. To sort out the technical faults - silver F / A-18s and F-14s from a carrier for an air raid, and miraculously disguised F-16s for the actual strike - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice to say, the most interesting thing about the movie is the credit titles that fade and then disappear into a flashbook, which is likely to be available to all users of Final Cut Pro. If you bring all your creativity into your own fortune, Michael Keusch will be placed in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
