I do not know what the hype is about ... This is really a bad movie ... it has brought me nothing, the only lineage scene is where everyone gathers at the party, and plays a nice song, uplifting beat and nice filming that make you move ... that was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie lacks everything to suck the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think about, as some people say, there is no connection between the two different stories ... it was more an attempt to revise Anderson's 'Magnolia', which was brilliant, but it falls blatantly ... Okay, it's easy and easy to see, but they're also movie clips. Maybe write a story before you shoot a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
