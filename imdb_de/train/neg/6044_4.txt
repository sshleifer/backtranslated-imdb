A well-made entry in the serial killer genre, which unfortunately proves to be really satisfying in his own presumption. Willem Dafoe is a brilliant New York detective who seeks to track down an imitator using the same killing techniques of Renaissance art used in a series of murders he had solved years ago. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and they have (at least for a while) a pretty good chemistry. Other characters are displayed to conveniently connect the two cases. Clea Duval is the friend of a former victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of art broker / mentor for Dafoe ... that's a bit hard to take, though of course Stormare is never boring. The end of the movie is especially disappointing. Look quickly for Deborah Harry as Dafo's less impending neighbor.
