With the resounding success of "God's Army," every Mormon with camera now seems to make a movie. In the case of the new "The other side of the sky" that was not a bad thing at all. This movie was not great, but pretty good. However, "The Singles Ward" is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story of a young, divorced Mormon man being pushed back into single life tells the writing and recording style of "The Singles Ward" very similar to the 80s comedy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" , However, the similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original and well played (as stupid comedies as these are ever), "The Singles Ward" is just the opposite. It's very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the jokes are either flat or clich√©s and jokes you've probably heard about a million times. The other 10% seem to fill the time. And the spectacle is not terrible, but at best amaturiert. Besides, if you are not Mormon yourself or are very, very familiar with the Mormon culture, you will hardly get anything at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appeal to a wide range of audiences both inside and outside the Mormon Church, this movie is definitely a big inside joke, and even if you understand it, it's just not so funny
