I'm a big fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite author since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor I really appreciate, and when I heard that he was playing the role of O'Brien, I was swinging. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer on the DVD First and some fears set in, mostly in regards to the honestly terrible "song song" when the Eurythmics mechanically "1984!" Again and again, an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> Overall, the drama is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension at the Ministry of Truth is over, especially in the devastating scene of 101. Here, however, the film is disappointed. The film focuses too much on the love affair between Winston and Juliet, about which Orwell apparently does not write. He wrote about a shattering future, about how Ingsoc built a man's beliefs and destroyed them all in the name of his brother who was to love Big Brother. The film skips the most important part of the book. Winstons poses with his position in life and in the world and with his transformation over O'Brien. <br /> <br /> IMDb commentary At the moment, it is said that the movie is holding on to the book, which is completely wrong. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to the Goldstien Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the first cases in which Winston finds the article among the non-persons, but it is mentioned at the end. If you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A horrible script that some excellent actors can not save. Michael Radford seems to have missed the point Orwell had tried, and the electronica soundtrack is frankly awful.
