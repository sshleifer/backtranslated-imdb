Normally, I only comment on movies I like and find "everyone to their liking," but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which seems to be losing itself in the shuffle, is that these two selfish adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry and inflict unpredictable suffering on their children. Even considering the culturally sanctioned drunkenness, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they set in motion. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? To hell with everyone else. Whether things "work out in the end" is really not the point; In fact it is pretty irrelevant. The point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a dependency position, is made easy by this film and thereby reinforced. There are far more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could have carried out that would have turned an army of social workers upside down in a heartbeat.
