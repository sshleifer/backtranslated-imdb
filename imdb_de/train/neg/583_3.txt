I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it a while ago and I especially enjoy BBC dramas. But I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: The whole series made me laugh much more than the novel. <br /> <br /> First, the music (and songs) seems completely out of place in a historical drama (sounds like a contemporary horror movie) and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed with the way how the cameras turned around the actors. I've seen some scenes shot this way in "North and South" and it all seemed fine, but in The Tenant it's definitely over the top and just annoying. Camera movements can not bring wood to life. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters was first properly introduced. The little boy has done a very good job, he is very cute and the best feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER's Tara Fitzgerald's characterization of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh without emotion. She does not seem to cry realistically at all. I just could not believe Markham fell in love with her, and I'm not mentioning the awful haircut she'd gotten. I could not help but feel sorry for her husband! I feel like being married to such a Virago ... Besides, he was the only lead actor who sounded right to me. I liked Toby Stephens well, not Helen Graham's brother very well. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel that deals with grim issues such as alcoholism and cruelty. What is hinted at in the book and left to the imagination of the reader, is taken with pleasure in the TV adaptation: Some scenes are made rude and funny (as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed) and others who are too playful period drama! I mean, are not we getting enough of these bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
