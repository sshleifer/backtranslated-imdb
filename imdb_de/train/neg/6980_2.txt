Historically correct? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you blink, and the light falls on the subject. Core accuracy, however, is no compensation for a gloomy, incomplete and inconsistent conspiracy, countless cartoons and an unsatisfactory result. The main characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing clich√©s ranging from the "enigmatic and noble" Indians to the "stuffy but sadistic" British officers. A wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating time in American history. I want my money back.
