I've seen some pretty bad movies in the past, but what did they actually think of when they made this movie? Had the production teams turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​doing it, because you really have to turn yourself upside down to find some fun. I'm a fan of most genres and enjoy "shoot 'em up" games, but putting together the stupid scenes from the game made it ridiculous and unsurpassed. <br /> <br /> As most of you said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone rating this film over 4 must be part of the production company or Sega or have a very distorted concept of entertainment. <BR> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I was more upset about the video store that held up a thumb that made me hire it. Thank God I had a second movie to restore some of my belief in movies. <br /> <br /> A comic-type would be right to say "Worst Movie Ever!"
