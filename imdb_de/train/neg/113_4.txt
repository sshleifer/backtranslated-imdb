Today I offered "They All Laughed" on VHS for sale. It was a really old and very much used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references on the cover: The names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very high high low and I decided to risk it and buy it. I searched IMDb and the user rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked into "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Impressive ?? four stars! So I decided that I can not lose time and see right away. In fact, I just watched "They All Laughed" and found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are poorly developed and it took me many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot should be funny (private eyes that fall in love with the women), but I did not laugh the whole story. The coincidences in a huge city like New York are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women, as if she were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is pretty ridiculous. Dorothy Stratten's Playboy co-star and playmate will surely end up murdering her husband after the release of the movie and showing their lives in "Star 80" and "Death of a". Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story " the amazing beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, future wife Keith Richards, the always wonderful, even fifty-two, Audrey Hepburn, and the song "Amigo" by Roberto Carlos, although I dislike him, Roberto Carlos has been since the late '60s Years of being the most popular Brazilian singer and being referred to by his fans as "The King." I will keep this film only for these attractions in my collection (male Dorothy Stratten) My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title ( Brazil): "Muito Riso and Muita Alegria" ("Much laughter and good luck")
