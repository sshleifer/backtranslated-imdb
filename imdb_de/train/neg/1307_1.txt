That was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend, here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two "Demons" movies very entertaining - they were so bad that they were great, but this one is just so bad that it's really, very, very bad. It's extremely boring, the story goes nowhere and I hated the characters - the woman who beat her husband and the weepy cries in the damned woman probably drove me to the madness of the best actor in the whole movie. I turned it off about three quarters of the way because I was very, very boring! Do not bother.
