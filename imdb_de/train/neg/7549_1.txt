If Edward Woodward were the flicks watching this movie, he would scream this with horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, people, but enough is enough. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now that. What are the similarities? No. It is no coincidence that three of the original stars Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars represent another great British actor. The main component of these originals is the brilliance of the films. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that can not be reproduced in the US. The word is CULT and how can you destroy a cult movie better than bastard it with a remake or even a sequel? <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task even before he took to the streets. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic than other cult films; it resists genre, intelligent scripts, A-grade actors, the music score, the descriptive set pieces and all the stories around the film. <br /> <br /> So here's a remake. Do not worry. This remake did not damage any originals. Some important aspects of history had to be reworked for the modern US - communication, paganism, virgins. But that's just the whole premise. So we give the policeman a nam-style trauma with shock-music flashbacks for the cheap horrors. Then, without a mobile phone mast on the island sorting out communication - but in the real world, this would not happen. Cops just do not disappear. Give him a bloody connection to motivation and not to the struggle of beliefs, and you have the remake. Waffle thin, right? <br /> <br /> It's just that everything was laid out with a trowel. The name changes were just hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no center of town to orient oneself in, only a few houses scattered around a forest and that was it. Willow was only annoyed because he did not disclose any information and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he went into the well, all they knew was that he would lock him up. The script was signposted to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end. The epilogue was absolutely funny and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This end is probably the best way to sum up the difference between the two. After the most terrible day, the most beautiful sunset ends. The other end ends with a follower who explains everything you can do. <br /> <br /> I loved the original but went to the cinema with my head open and was happy to see the movie. I am grateful to know that this movie is likely to end up somewhere under a highway, only to be mercifully forgiven this time.
