My friends and I left after 15 minutes and were not the first. After that we tried to get our money back. Cinema management did not allow it, but they agreed to let us watch another movie. The only time that worked for us was Dickie Roberts: Former child star to see. As you can see, this was not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. It must be almost a second when I saw a double head of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. For the sake of humanity, please do not see the Order.
