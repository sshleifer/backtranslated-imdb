This movie is completely crap! Avoid this waste of celluloid at any cost, it is vast and incoherent. I'm proud to explore the depths of the 70-year-old Sleaze cinema from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if you see a horse mate, this movie is for you. The saddest part was this lame werewolf suit with the functional Wang. I mean, it's just hard to sit through, not to mention acting is terrible and the soundtrack is badly dubbed. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (which looks like a gorilla's hand reaching for a woman's bare butt), but do not waste your time or money as you will not get them back either.
