what a sh * t is this? Power Rangers vs. Freddy? It was seen and as good as the first movie in the beginning, but from the part in which the protagonists get superpowers in their dreams, it became childish. This Sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected that things were very mature, but it was only 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for little kids. Moreover, it is too much focused on Christianity. I know Freddy's demon, but there are many religions that can fight demons differently. Why does it always have to be Christianity? This is total orientalism and filled with white men / western superiority. Do not look at it, show it to little kids who love Power Rangers.
