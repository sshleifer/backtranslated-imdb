I wanted to see it for two reasons. On the one hand it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, on the other hand the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with a bit of subtlety, as in The Big Knife. But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here it does not matter to the actors, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer thinks. Jack Palance gets bored watching Shelley Winters, and Shelley Winters wonders what she's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course they had to use the dog story again! You could have come up with other ideas. Maybe it makes the color nice to see the same place they shot High Sierra, but that definitely does not give the movie any quality. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I would rather die than see it again ...
