I work in a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with a few copies. This kind of movies shows the sci-fi channel. The kind of movie that nobody ever wants and only hire those idiots when they bring him back, I ask them, "Was it alright?", They say "No, we shut it off after 15 minutes!" Films with terrible computer-generated, super-imposed monsters and the like, very unappetizing. <br /> <br /> This is the same kind of movie as Grendel, and a waste of time if you have a reasonable (and only reasonable) interest in good Beowulf-based film, then try Beowulf & Grendel with Gerard Butler, who also starred in the highly anticipated 300 as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> We also have another Beowulf movie this year: Star-studded cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let your hopes rise like Eragon's or we're all in for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As for the rental, here's my rule of thumb: if there are only one or two copies, do not borrow it because it's a lot of crap. (This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is alien or a documentary.)
