A gave him a "2" instead of a "1" (awful), as there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning. There was a lot of talent in the special effects and the artwork. But that was not enough to save it. <br /> <br /> The "Sepia" has softened and washed away in other films before many other steps. Nothing new there. I can see that there were some hat-tips to other old, classic films. OK. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But a movie has to be entertaining and interesting, not something that will drive you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The storyline and script of this movie was awful, the characters two-dimensional. Slow moving. Some scenes were nice to look at, but in the end it was pretty boring, I could not recommend it.
