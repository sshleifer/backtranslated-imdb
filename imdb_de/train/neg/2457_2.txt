Some people do not like the animation. I personally think the animation was quite remarkable when this movie was done. There are many older cartoons that I just love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was built. The characters are all just ... well, stupid. And they should not be for this movie. Apparently everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for starters.) The way they behave in general annoys me. My two sisters and I laughed at most of the movie. I think if many people saw this before they saw the newer ones, they would not have left. I am glad that I rented it and did not buy it. There are few films that cause me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, even though it comes first. Or down there, depending on the view.
