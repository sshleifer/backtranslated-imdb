I've been hooked on this Kari chick for a while, and as far as she looked in this movie, there were no complaints. But after I caught it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure that's the only thing that's not inappropriate in the movie. The script is terrible, the drama is terrible, the direction is terrible. I saw someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. If a movie is so bad, you can easily turn it into a softcore porn, but instead I see a pasty white guy who prevents me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing but a trick , They should have just done Cinemax, so the movie was not a complete waste of time, but no. With a script that was so terrible, Wuhrer's appearance should be capitalized, as this is the only pro of the film. 2/10 just because she looked so hot.
