I have a 5-minute rule (sometimes I leave the road for 10). If a movie is not good for the first 5 or 10 minutes, it will probably never get better. I have not yet experienced a film that denies this theory. Dan in real life is definitely no exception. I watched this turkey and thought about it; Wow, that's not funny, not touching, not sad, and I do not like any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The story of a counselor / widower raising two young daughters who fall in love with his brother friend. I suppose the slogan would be "advocate columnist who could use advice"? I dont know. Dan's character did not strike me as someone qualified to give advice. I think that's the irony? I dont know. He goes to his parents, brothers, sisters and their children for a kind of family retreat that looks very sweet and potential food for good comedies, storylines ... none that ever show up. The central story is essentially how he loves this woman, but she can not have it. Anyone who has a pulse will realize that he will eventually get it, but you have to suffer from the painless, banal, lifelong film network dialogue "Murderers of Love" to arrive at the inevitable happy ending is really one of the worst movies I have have ever seen.
