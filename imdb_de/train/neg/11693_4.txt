A fun concept, but poorly implemented. Apart from the pretty good make-up effects, there really is not much. There are obvious problems. For example, after seemingly taking weeks and weeks to turn from fat to normal size, the protagonist seems to become fatally thin in days of normal height ... and once he's fatally dead, he stays pretty deadly What seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that - the cinematography is extremely cheap in TV show quality and above all the acting is pretty awful everywhere. Robert John Burke always seems to play in a funny way of uncompromising Charlton Heston, and it's literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this movie the way I am is that, once it has reached its last third and has taken over the role of Joe Mantegna, the movie is a fun, camping "Cheesefest slaughterhouse" design creates gangsters crazy plans to torment the totally vile gypsies, make some fun. The end, albeit predictable, is pretty nasty. Avoid, unless you are a King-o-Phile or are REALLY nervous at the presentation of the voice of Fat Tony of the Simpsons terrorizing a Gypsy camp.
