This movie was exactly what I expected when I first read the casting. I could probably have written a more exciting story, too bad they left it to a pack of howler monkeys. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he has to thank God (and us too) for not having to rely on his abilities as an actor to make a living. He can not play, he can not speak, he can not move very well on the mainland without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all. She was obviously not selected for her amazing skill in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. Still, I have to admit that she could be the acting teacher of the Tomba, because he's even a worse actor than she is and that's funny, especially considering she's not Italian. I laughed all the time and watched this movie. I found it so ridiculous and pointless that it really made me laugh, very loud.
