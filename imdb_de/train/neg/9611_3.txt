There are so many silly things about this movie that I can only name a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. His name? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it there, boy, it sounds good to Humphrey.) 2. His long, curly hair and stupid sideburns. 3. His black beard, complete with spurs! 4. You are not sure what color lip gloss you are wearing, but it is not particularly flattering. CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does not matter to him, either. 2. The man is swallowed by his hat throughout the movie! Could not you find a hat that suits him? Just a bit?!!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the back. 4. He blows the smoke off his gun too often, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you're an occasional Bogart or Cagney fan, you can They assume a change to see them in a western, doing themselves a favor and forgetting that thought. ALSO LOOK AT THE HORSES! (That is, if they do not look bored.) <br /> <br /> In fairness, I admit that Westerns are my least favorite genre, but I have still seen much, much better than this. <br /> On a comedy level or as a high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, the viewer is careful. So only see this if a) you have to see every western out there, b) you're a real Cagney or Bogie executor. C) the above comments appeal to you. Woah ?? ..
