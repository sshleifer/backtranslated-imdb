James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he took a role in that unenthusiastic trash. Affleck is just a lightweight that just can not cut it, the rest of the cast is truly unforgettable. I saw this in the US in an empty theater, I soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went out before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I saw in England that the film had a glowing account of that Yoyo "Paul Ross" on one of the rundown Sunday markets. I always rely on Ross to save money on movie tickets. If he says that the movie is good, I can go directly to this website. This film should have gone straight to a â‚¬ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
