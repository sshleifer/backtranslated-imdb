I sat through this film and I must say that it has only just managed to keep my attention. The film would have been a bit more bearable if I had to not look at the terrible CGI, if you want to see the CGI when you look at this CGI to know what you should avoid this is to be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that has no resemblance to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All in all, the story was not as bad as the CGI I was pretty impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and a little more character information would have been nice, as it occasionally for me little confusing was honest, I wish I would have missed this here.
