1. watched 17.05.2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The rather lame report of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this highly acclaimed event. The repetition of the catastrophe is not bad, but the drama around them is sometimes stupid, poorly played, and too soapine like an opera. The story is the same as the last Oscar-winning, except that it shows us how the crew tried to hide the actual catastrophe that happened almost too late. Just for nostalgia purposes and to get a feel for what James Cameron competed in his spare time (hardly?).
