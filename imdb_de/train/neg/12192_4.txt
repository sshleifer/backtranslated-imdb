I think we all start with many reviews: "That could have made a great movie." A denied ex-con grew up fresh, a tidy suburban family was his goal. Revenge, retaliation, manipulation. Marty's usual application of the check syrup. But somewhere in Universal's skyscraper, a memorandum came to light: everyone was fucking nuts. <br /> <br /> Nolte only speaks with raised eyebrows, Lange sneaks through cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod's!" Her way through her scenes and Bobby D ... well, he's on a completely different magic carpet. He's acting on some kind of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound Accent Hybrid, cabling big cigars and giggling for random atrocities like "problem child". And I want you to imagine the above accent. Imagine now, it's seething with religious rhetoric at head level, as if he'd swallowed six Bibles, and you've got De Niro's fancy here. Most distracting, however, is his OVERDONE use of the "De Niro Face", for which he is so stupid. Her eyes narrowed, her brow furrowed, her lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you look like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story began apparently 14 years ago, when Nolte De Niro could not spare time in the house for various attacks. Upon his release, he senses that Nolte is withdrawing from him, and then justifies the terrorization of him and his relatives. And we're supposed to give De Niro's character a slight pass, because Nolte has withheld information that could have shortened his sentence. De Niro is one of those criminals who, though guilty of unspeakable deeds, feels that his bondage justifies the continuation of such acts outwardly. Mmm-Kay. <br /> <br /> He goes to Notle's nearly-mistress (in a scene that some want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, you know. That's one of the disadvantages of Wesley Strick's screenplay: absolute predictability. As De Niro's harassment becomes more cruel, you can call the rest of the action pretty well before it happens. Strick is not completely discredited, as he creates some compelling, dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis's shabby exchange in an empty theater is the best scene in the film), but most of the time that's overkill. Scorsese's cartoonist photographic approach seems compulsory, not to mention the completely altered Bernard Hermann Score (I've always waited for the Wolfman to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula). <br /> <br /> So we come to the comedic part of the strip. Unintentionally funny, that's it. You know these scenes where something graphically awful happens, but you can not help but giggle others? You will do it here. Nolte and Lange talk about infidelity, De Niro's thumb flirting, he dresses himself and a kitchen panties on a certain substance, which one must believe. And Bob's infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, amazing, inexhaustible view of the whole philosophy he discovered in prison. I wanted him to be killed to silence him, to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This is really Scorsese's version of Freddy Krueger. The way De Niro loves to talk, stare, withstand pain, right down to his one-liners, is old Freddy. When they were scalded by a pot of thrown water: "Are you trying to give hot water?" You're welcome. And that's just an example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 band and want to see Balsam, Peck and Mitchum (or a serious movie with a shake of the head) experience almost 30 years later, avoid a trip to the Cape ,
