To be honest, I'm quite upset that I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering due to the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith. Have they all been written by his friends? The action runs away, the music is irritating and overused, the script is just bleak and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) at best mediocre. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but to say it is brilliant, if not, will certainly only encourage him to make the same mistakes again, d. Yes, it's his first movie, his low budget, etc. - I understand it, but it's also for the public to buy it, and it just is not the place.
