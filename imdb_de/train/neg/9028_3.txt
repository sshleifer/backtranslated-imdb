I have just seen this movie and I have to say that this turkey is there with such a great premise and great talent !!! A friend lent me this film, and I was open-eyed because it praised the story so much. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner retired as a fighter pilot ... why? Why did you make him a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character as his new pilot ... well, we'll never see Costner getting close to a plane for the rest of the movie! Costner encounters a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a large Mexican businessman and brings Costner along. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is almost dead and Costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to be with a Quinn colleague! But nothing comes of it ... Nada, Zilcho! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why did they have the horse sales with the Quinn partner, if nothing came of it? <br /> <br /> After leaving Costner for dead, they turn Madeline Stowe's character into a whore. Then she attacks one of Quinn's men who has paid for a round ... She punctures him with his own knife. and next she was transferred to a monastery! No explanation why it was moved or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent for such a faint script and poor editing wasted !! I just looked at it because a friend owned it and showed it to me ... I'll throw it on the damned thing for the 2 hours I've wasted my life!
