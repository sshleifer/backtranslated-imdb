Wow OK. After reading the little feud here, I decided that I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is awful. I stopped looking at it. I strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie. They will be more spooky / entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget with bad spectacle is completely wrong and should be neglected. <br /> <br /> I am in no way affiliated with the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad movie.
