"Wild tigers that I know." It is shown only in big cities to be sure. It's one of those films so artistic that it makes no sense except the director! I hate the! And all these oh so alternative / artistic people are trying DESPERATEL to find "metaphors" in EVIDENT horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, no story, no morals, no chronology and nothing amusing or even touching. For me it was a few ragged scenes that had nothing to do with each other and were all for "show" to show how "artistic" and "visual" they could become. It was an attempt to make another teenage fear movie, but he has reached the goal humanely on every level. Then the credits roll! I was waiting for it to make SENSE! I have been waiting for "the good". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "Art House" films. This will NOT be among them. You'll be very angry with yourself for paying to see this movie, not to mention you're buying it on DVD.
