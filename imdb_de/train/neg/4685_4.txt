Until the last minutes of the film, I would have given the film a score of 7 or 8 stars. The end, however, is so horrible and "Hollylysian" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they have been ordered to fire their nuclear missiles. Captain Gene Hackman is about to launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, confirms the launch orders first. The problem is that the captain and the 1st officer must simultaneously use the start buttons to start BOTH. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington remains firm until this leads to an armed insurgency aboard the submarine. Eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not fired. Cool. Here comes the part that just does not sound true. After they're back on land and in front of a review board, Washington and Hackman (who have just half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddies! Huh ?! A too shabby end to make the movie worthwhile for me.
