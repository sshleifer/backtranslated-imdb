This movie was awful in the worst way: you just did not care. You did not care what happened in the plot; They did not care about the characters. Everyone was without a heart. In the end, I came out after about 45 minutes because I just did not want to go through my mind anymore. There is far too much sex in the movie. Sex can be okay; It may even do the movie (hence Karma Sutra), but the traffic here was neither beautiful nor sexy. It was just ugly. Do not see this movie
