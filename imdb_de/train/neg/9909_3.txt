This was not a successful Western. They rode this nut in the blazing sun in a stroller with a parasol and killed people for its own reasons. This person is sitting in a snow cave during a snowstorm, cutting off parts of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of wolves that are not there. What is the meaning of this movie? Could Bruce Dern not find something better? That was a waste of film.
