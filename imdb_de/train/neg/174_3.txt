* Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Return to the lodge by the lake' is a useless movie. The acting was not good and the plot was not even interesting from afar. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first movie and added a lot more to his character than this one. It seemed he was not even interested in doing the sequel. His acting was good, but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast, because in my opinion they are not even worth mentioning. But I do it. The figure of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly, she stands next to Stanley Caldwell in the center. The role made no sense and should have been thought out a bit better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was far below her decent quality and the casting people should have been looking for someone or someone else. Director Mike was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose to be there, but it did not seem that his death was necessary. Acting for this role was good, not great, but better than Salem's. <br /> <br /> The plot was really bad if you think about it. Stanley, who is believed to be dead, enters the set 'Cabin by the Lake', the film based on his screenplay. He encounters the director and in a short while the director is dead and Stanley directs the show. Yes, out of nowhere the crew lets this stranger come into the picture and ends the movie without knowing anything about him. There are some murders, not much, and those shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on set is electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character is chewed by a motorboat. And you get entangled in a plant before drowning. These authors must have had a hard time for the excitement. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed by the filming of the film. The way the budget has been changed over and over again from a low budget to a normal level quickly became irritating. The new hut on the lake was badly laid out. We will not show it, but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It only worked in the first movie because we were shown a lot more space, but it did not work in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All but a few had no reason to be there. The acting of the kid was really bad and ... they just had no purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a continuation of the selection of where the first one left off. I can take "hut by the lake", but that was simply not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this and you should do it. It's nothing like the first one and it was all too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued for the second. Not to mention that the writing was terrible. Only apply this if you need help falling asleep. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. Incidentally, it sounds like it could come to a movie that is already good on its own. Stop throwing and we may be fine! <br /> <br /> (Did not the filmmakers notice they were showing us how to shoot the sea scenes of the first scene?) They were all made in a tank.) Never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br />
