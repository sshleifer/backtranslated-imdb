Semana Santa is overwhelmingly bad. It's so wrong that I can not start like this. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge's husband was shot to protect her, goes from Madrid to Sevilla for her job as a police officer. During the holy week (Semana santa, you see? ... all fall asleep sleeping, they said it was so bad in so many ways, even from the beginning), a murderer kills his victims like bulls in a bullring. She collaborates with the male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and the nice Feodor Atkine. Soon she discovers that she will be the killer's next target (wearing a red robe). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ...? That was the question that put the whole movie in my head. <br /> <br /> Q: Why do we have A: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I even apologize for the crap first-hand) <br /> <br /> Q: Why were we this Saturday? first end of the week only 8 people in the theater? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-Man was expelled the same day. But also the fact that the film has made a lot of fun with vile reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie made? A: Money, I think. But boy, Mira needed the money. <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? First of all, there is always something in common with European co-productions. Here you have a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then it wants to play at the same level as US Thriller / Slashers / Whodunit / Mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, though needlessly and poorly written and filmed, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> However, to give credit to the story, the script writer wanted to give the story a political twist. Wrong: Made in flashbacks in a traffic-like photography, this is certainly the most interesting in the movie. Could stick with it, would not have to go through the whole movie. It's better to go straight to Guillermo del Tros' THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo) for some fun. <br /> <br /> Then the homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are gay twins of S & M drug addicts who have been stabbed. The annoying Olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency, which is held by a heavily shaved overweight with a blond platinum wig. Describes the character of Mira Sorvino as a great dyke at all times. Do we need something like that? Nah Just unnecessary insulting comments, just like in old times. <br /> <br /> Then the tension. Yipee No obvious motive. The first murders are an illusion because they represent a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the murderer (of course, a terrible fascist) could have been done from the beginning, as it appears at the end of the film. I think it was time for the director to say "weel" Damn movie. Let's just say who the killer is and why he kills. "<br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he's a director, wrong: no sense of excitement, no sense of directing the actors, no knowledge about tempo change, a huge mega-drill, the scenes of the holy week are unnecessary (maybe a co-production rule that says: OK, shoot in Seville, but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with the Easter celebrations.) Here we are : a mystery movie for tourists!) <BR /> <br /> Then the actors, all wrong, Mira Sorvino is bored to death: she does practically nothing, except to be stabbed in the right hand The best tat (Replacement Killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) was as if they never existed ... Olivier Martinez ... When will the producers find out that he is not an actor, but a mannequin with no language skills and experience? Feelings? Feodor Atkine, fad and you We only have great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of this last century (and I hope for some more roles in this latest one). She is the main attraction here as she is the only one who gives life to her bad lines. I will not mention the other actors because they are only one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow. <br /> <br /> Incoherent director, inconsistent actor, implausible act. Idiocy incarnates. Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
