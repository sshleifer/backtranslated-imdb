This film does not contain humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who suffers from a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too much of my own life experiences. This movie was the version of the man from "Mommy Dearest". It shows both graphically and precisely the life that many children of a mentally ill parent go through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to get corrupt and behave as if they were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that it's funny. No way, I say! It's just sick humor at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or who do not believe what our families are really going through.
