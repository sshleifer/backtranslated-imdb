It seems that a number of such films were released in the 1970s. And the fact that I can not remember the title of any one of them is a measure of their impact. These are what writers would call "pot kettle". They are little more than a means to keep movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; More than enough names to fuck on cinema seats. There is something for every taste of the hero. However, it is believed that most viewers were still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Your talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so much money and reputation can still be so desperate or lacking in the good sense. This type of film hardly adds gilding to a resume. Sometimes actors should choose their director, rather than vice versa. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the beginning. This ridiculously inappropriate Jaunty jazz music, which also leaked every time a random noise was required, had all the atmospheric beliefs of the Muzak elevator. Who imagined a jazz band when a scene represented the steaming jungle of Central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees as background? Definitely a serious game. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have had enough atmosphere and tension to increase my score by a good two points. This director should have taken the trouble to look at "Lawrence of Arabia" or even the Western by Sergio Leone; he might have learned a few things. But then he probably would not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played well the theme of the missing woman in his film 'Frantic'. Later it was brought back to Harrison Ford with equal vigor. In any case, the confusion about their loss and the tension of the chase was palpable. Here, if Michael Caine would otherwise be forced to build up a little bravery and courage, Rex Harrison would emerge like some cunning, old genius from nowhere, always putting him on the right track when the story stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the photography was rather good, and the beautiful surroundings were used very well. But then the stupid music has to blow up the atoms, which were created for a small ambience. Action scenes were also designed and matted with such incongruously choreographed combat sequences that they might have been staged in a first scene - years of drama lessons. And of course the players have to fight for a jazz accompaniment - like you. <br /> <br /> And that's about as much comment as this article deserves. Except to say that the script was pretty miserable, too. <br /> <br /> Stay with your hobby. Even if it contained your favorite movie stars, you will certainly be disappointed.
