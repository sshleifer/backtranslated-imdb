I have to say that although this movie was all about an action that was stolen from movies like Friday, the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horror movies Hollywood released recently. The murders were sometimes too imaginative, but in most cases they were the original. The cast was mediocre, which is expected from low-budget features, but much better than what this much larger Studio Artisan / Lions Gate offers. My only real complaint, which was not due to the budget of the film, which must have been small, was the fictitious "twist" end. I'm sorry, but that put this movie in the bad category for me. The end was just stupid and tackled. Before, I was a bit bored, but I really enjoyed it. 4.10
