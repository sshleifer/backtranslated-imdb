MAKE 0 you sacks German braces! Well, when I started to look at this sack of horror, it was a Sunday afternoon, and I was just looking for showtime stuff. I was introduced to a hot naked baby and like any guy (I'm a guy, the email is my sisters ...), I was happy. Then they threw everything at the dogs, spat on it, lit it and put it out. Do you want to know how? THE DUMB-KÃœKCHEN RECEIVES! The dialogue throughout the movie was just awful. sounded like something my second-class brother could do. The violence was nice for some scenes, but some were just totally moronic. The scene in the pit where he gives the guy the knife ... stupid idiot! To sum it up: This is a pure cinema soaked in the chocolate syrup known as nudity and crowned with the cherry of the terrible drama that only a porn star could deliver.
