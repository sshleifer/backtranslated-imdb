I thought this movie seemed to be a case study of how not to do a movie for the most part. Since I'm a filmmaker, I give the permanence a second. <br /> <br /> The problems remain from beginning to end, as the plot is predictable with most, if not all, successful war stories. The graphics produced by the computer were too much like watching a video game at points, and the director seemed to make no attempt to give the story any realistic quality. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​who he was working with, but I did not find that information. <br /> <br /> It seemed like this project pushed the boundaries of a low-budget movie too far away. A production that captivates the viewer without your imagination being involved. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
