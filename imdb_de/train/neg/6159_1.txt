Why does anyone who has seen this film believe that it is their job to tell us if he is a fencer or not? This point is completely irrelevant to any arguments against this entire dog of a movie. I think sports movies fall into two categories; well-made films about the human spirit and competitions and "By the Sword". Honestly, this film could never decide what he wanted to be, a touching drama if he wanted to try to be your best in life, charging for competitive motivation or martial arts streaks. In the end, none of them did it convincingly or fully enough to let me take care of anything. <br /> <br /> For the record, I am also a fencing instructor (and now I am too) officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fencing into a movie does not automatically make it bad. I mean, look at Star Wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). I liked these films. But if for some reason you put bad sports into a bad movie, people think that it's only the purists who think it's a lame effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by comments about the smaller fencing topic. That's just a bad movie. In the end, this film has nothing for the fencing specialist or the movie fan, or just anyone who has a pulse and three brain cells. When I see a movie and am forced to think, `Man, I wish I would watch the Mighty Ducks. 'I know it's time to get over the argument with the theater director to get my money back and see if there's anyone in the lobby who will give me back two hours of my life.
