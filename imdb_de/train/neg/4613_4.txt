Well, what is that ?! I found Nicholson's character flat and most uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character has used up my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, not good bitch. It's not that I do not understand. It's not that I do not think some of the ideas could lead to anything more. This is a movie with nothing but the idea that we should accept these ideas, and that's exactly what the movie is about. That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd, but it should be so. This does not seem to me as a.) Funny, or b.) ... also interesting from a distance !!! This was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype make the most of it ... it's a waste of your time! Despite all this, the opening of the church sequence is pretty nice ...
