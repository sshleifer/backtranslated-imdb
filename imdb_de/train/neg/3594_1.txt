This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie that any serious horror fan should avoid. No action, terrible acting and annoying music. If you just look at the trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a shame that such things are available on VHS or video as long as there are so many good films that are not available. If you like vampires, try the Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic by Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. These are masterpieces, if you compare this with this garbage. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
