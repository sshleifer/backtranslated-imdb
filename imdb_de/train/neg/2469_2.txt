I think if you like endless dialogues that do not pass on the story, and eye-catching camera effects like the scene transitions on the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and she was not there. The pace was practically backward, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no feeling of fear or tension or EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman in terms of speed. That's not scary. It does not generate tension or atmosphere unless you are afraid of MTV. Like these reviewers, I also noticed that the movie eventually causes a sneer from the audience. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie.
