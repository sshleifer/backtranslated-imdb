Too much of some borrowed grade B- <br /> <br /> The Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in cinemas every year. For this reason, movie studios are avoiding the release of larger budgeted films this weekend. Every few years, a studio publishes a preprogrammed women's movie (2001 "The Wedding Planner") to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend with the same title "The Wedding Date" will try to find success and attract viewers who do not see the game. <br /> <br /> Ill people who apologize for it. Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV "Will and Grace") hires a male escort (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to pose as her friend for her sister's wedding in London. Her family makes it difficult for her not to be married, and her seven-year-old fiancé, who dismissed her for no reason, is the best man. To make him jealous Kat moves around Nick so he sees what he's missing. In the end, Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up and make someone love her. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to similar wedding movies. It is almost a copy of 1999's "Picture Perfect" and combines scenes like "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has a reverse "Pretty Women" theme, and the director knows her audience and makes smart references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> "The Wedding Date" has all the clichéd elements In a typical wedding movie, there is the stereotypically overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and practically plagiarized wedding speeches of the family and friends at wedding and rehearsal dinners. The turn at the end has been made before, but it was something that was not fully expected. The real reason why Kat was dumped is surprising and changes the direction of the movie in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Even if "The Wedding Date" is predictable, it can stand alone. Debra Messing proves in her first leading role that she can be charming and witty. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogues were too cheesy and unrealistic. He is able to make the most of what is given to him and to save the character. <br /> <br /> By using many clever puns (often sexual) the movie is actually funny. Although the movie is primarily a chick movie, it has components that everyone can enjoy. The good story and the humor make him the best date movie for a long time.
