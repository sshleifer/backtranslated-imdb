This movie is really bad. The drama is just awful except Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two McGangs. He comes to a city and suddenly he is chosen to fight against the evil people who want Indian land. The cover said that he himself was an Indian who had returned to his hometown. I did not hear that in the movie, if that was not clear. Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor Stiff and ugly. He said his lines like it too. And we would not talk about Sean Young, she was not one of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose Amanda Pays between Subterfuge and Subterfuge. I chose this because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not see that if you do not think that Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will update the cast list soon I have it at home. I wrote it down after watching the movie.
