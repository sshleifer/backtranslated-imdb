This movie is really bad. It may be tough, but it is. It's really. Bad script, every vampire clich√© in the book is used, and the origins of the main character are given no sympathy ... d. H. Ole Dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / Vampire movies in the past, but this does not even make it into the "terrible" slot. <br /> <br /> Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a movie teen slasher movement, add a dribble from Dracula Lore and mix a heady tonic of religious / surreal daydreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not say anything good about this movie as if it was not bad enough that it was made at all, they seem to be Johnny Lee Miller to have made an english accent ... what's the problem with what i hear? You're crying ... Well, he's English, but he sounds like an American trying to put on an English accent. All in all, you can also say your money well (if you're thinking of buying it.)) Or lend it, look at it and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
