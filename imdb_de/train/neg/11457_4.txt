OK. I know that the coveted 1980s John Hughes movies were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations of this movie were pretty low. <br /> <br /> Still, after confessing to this crap, there's one important thing I can do. 'I seem to come out of my head: <br /> <br /> I was just sitting through an 80s movie by Rob Lowe, who had no nudity and just a touch of sex in him. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful, the characters boring and shallow, the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes are incessant, uneventful and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have some weird Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I think (Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.)
