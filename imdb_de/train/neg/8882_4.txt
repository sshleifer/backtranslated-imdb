It would be too ironic to call a movie about a crippled mind lame and lifeless outside the tomb. However, this is an undeniable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) over LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); It can still be seen in itself, but it is so clich√© that it provokes a giggle instead of the intended cold. Thanks to the plight of the British film industry in the late 1970s, even a mediocre screenplay like this one managed to win 10 stars - Cliff Robertson (as the seductive husband), Jean Simmons (in the title role), Jenny Agutter ( as Robertson's half-sister), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic chauffeur), Ron Moody (as the unlucky doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons best friend and Jayston's wife), Flora Robson (as housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary reads Simmons' testament) and, most surprisingly, Jack Warner (as a gravestone sculptor) - though most of them do not actually contain anything. I'm sorry to say!
