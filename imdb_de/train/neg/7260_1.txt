"A Town Called Hell" (aka "A Town Called Bastard"), a British-Spanish co-production, was created after the success of Clint Eastwood in the Italian "Man With No Name" trilogy. The template used in most of these films was to hire acclaimed American actors whose careers were largely in decline and to synchronize their voices. This movie is no exception except that some British actors have been used. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to sum up, but here it is. The story begins with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who plunder a church and kill everyone in it, including the priest. A few years later, reel into the affected city, where the Shaw figure disguises himself as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not do anything to take justice with his weapon. <br /> <br /> Throw a mourning widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) into the mix, looking for her husband's killer. Add to that the fact that she drives around in a hearse, which, as in a coffin for God knows why. After the mayor was murdered by his ally La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is occupied by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I'm sorry, but the name escapes me). The colonel takes over the city and begins executing the city dwellers, forcing them to divulge the identity of the leader. Even though they have opened the film side by side, it is difficult to say from the dialogue that the Landau and Shaw characters know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does it and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those responsible have regretted this movie. It's just awful and deserves my dreaded "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the movie aiming his mark at the one of use. Even Landau can not save this movie. The beautiful woman Stevens is also completely wasted here. I had just made Peckinpah's "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" last year and found it odd that she would appear in the confusion of a movie. Savalas made some of these pictures ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express") made in the time before Kojak. Michael Craig is also somewhere as "Paco" with it. <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "Westerns", though he would play the villain in the two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri also appeared in a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and before his early death in 1975 went into other memorable roles. <br /> <br /> Fairly fair, the version I viewed ran for only 88 minutes. Instead of the longer runtimes of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb, however, I can not tell where an extra 7 or 8 minutes is a big one Make a difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid these.
