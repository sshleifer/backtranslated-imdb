I was torn to DARK ENGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" homage to the biggest pin-up ever - but there is so little actual "content" that the movie itself is practically pointless. I can not really understand what the motivation or "sense" of this film is - since there is very little biographical information in the narrative - so those who do not know much about Bettie will not know much anymore after being DARK ANGEL either saw ... <br /> <br /> The film essentially describes the last years of Bettie's career in bondage modeling. Almost the entire movie consists of "reenactments" of some of Bettie's "more famous" photo shoots and loops. These re-enrollments literally take up 75% of the movie's runtime and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. The film briefly goes into its short-lived legitimate acting activities and its later decision to leave the business and become religious - but all this is quite in favor of depicting long and lengthy reenactments of scenes ... <br /> <br / > DARK ANGEL is not a horrible movie - there is simply no substance. The other problem is that the actress Bettie plays is really very similar to her only in more distant settings - up close is a no-go. The other thing that bothered me is that while Bettie made several topless modeling shoots, the only nudity in the movie was a short section shot in a zoo during the credits. The movie itself is obviously extremely cheap, but does within its limits what he can adjust and what the costume is concerned. Acting is pretty much made of wood and not forgotten by all involved. In fact, the most memorable of the whole movie for me was when I found in the credits the actor who played Irving Klaw's real name is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. I can not say that I recommend them too high, unless you are a true bedfile executor and must possess something that is related to her. And if you feel so bad - then you have to be treated anyway ... 4/10
