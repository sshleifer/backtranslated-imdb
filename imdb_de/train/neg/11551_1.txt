Seriously, there's absolutely nothing good about this bastard ever. Randolph Scott, a homosexual in the closet who has lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is wooden and boring in his least role. At age 57, he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, though it's not so important here because Gail Russell looks so much older than she is 31 years old and so ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual villain role, but it's not enough to save that garbage. Thankfully, they're not Western anymore, they're just old-fashioned, racist, old movies that glorify and murder rifles. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
