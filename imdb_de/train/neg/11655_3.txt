I was very disappointed in this movie. I thought "Scary Movie," though not a great movie, is very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny and sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville parody was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Well, I admit that I'm at a disadvantage, as I have not seen some of the films that are different in this parody than in the first ones I saw them all in. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that ruined some of the maybe good jokes. Scenes and jokes take off too long. <br /> <br /> In addition, the same jokes are repeated over and over again. For example, the talking bird. Ok, it was the first and maybe the second time funny. But it was always repeated until it got annoying. The routine between the wheelchair user and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was initially amusing, but was repeated over and over and ended silly and even tasteless. Some jokes were even repeated from the first movie on. For example, "creaming", which I think you would call Cindy (Anna Faris), was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had spent so much time giving sex to her boy that he was basically blue Balls from hell had It was funny when he "creamed" them. But this time it was not the right place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor in general were more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor, however, was exaggerated and unnecessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no room in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon) Wayans, who in my opinion was the funniest character of the first movie. The scene with him and the potted plant was one of my favorites from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. , , They have much more comic skills than endless jokes.
