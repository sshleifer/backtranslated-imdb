I will not criticize the movie. There is not much to discuss. It has good pet shop scenes that were probably pretty amazing at the time. Clyde Beatty is not a matinee idol. He is a bit small and does not look very good. But that's okay. He is the man in this lion cage. We know that if he can not take time out of his lions to look after his girlfriend, he will land with her on an island and save the day. Someone said earlier that this is a history lesson. The scenes in the circus are of a different day, especially the children who hang out. I did not know that they had sailed on three mast-skiers in the thirties. It looked like something from 1860. I think that's the footage they had. No wonder the thing was destroyed. They always talk about fixing them. There is even an airship. It tells us a bit about female women's relationships at the time, a kind of stupid stupidity. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
