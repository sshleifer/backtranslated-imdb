I read the novel by Rice with interest and was quite enchanted with its characters and history based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, in this catastrophic adaptation, I was simply CALLED. The casting was based only on the physical appearance and not on the acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blonde nor could work his way out of a wet paper bag). The embarrassingly awkward and contradictory attempts of the cast to influence a French accent were funny, but not in a fun way. I had to flinch at this cluttered and melodramatic tripe and was surprised that I had finished it. <br /> <br /> A warning to the fans of the novel.
