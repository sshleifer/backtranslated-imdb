After a few meager years, 1968 was a pretty good time for Elvis: Not only did he make the acclaimed comeback TV special, but he also became a dad and also appeared in two pretty good films? SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. So I can personally forgive him for the misstep that was STAY AWAY, JOE, which at best turns out to be an interesting misfire and not that bad. Surely, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing? as a stupid Indian dad of Elvis' character and a wild bartender who also has Mr. Presley in mind - but you're glad to see Elvis surrounded by Hollywood top talent like Katy Jurado (as Meredith's Mexican wife), the two jones ?? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, who is especially amusing as a sarcastic Chief Thundercloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father who still dresses his old chief dresses today! <br /> <br /> Although there is a surprising (though not unwelcome) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of freelance parties where the male Indians while Presley usual hit the bottle have their frauizing skills behind their backs ! As you'd expect, Arizona's typically western landscape is a big plus, and the sleepy, snoring bullfight is not just a good, but an important plot. On the other hand, we've seen the climatic "destruction of the house" too often since then and do not work so well here ...
