After I finished the movie, I was so upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. That's 2 hours, I'll never come back. Pooh. When you start, you might think, "Wow, that's really good!" But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie to the dumbest end I've ever seen. This movie is just pathetic. Acting is boring, the story is anything but original and there is nothing particularly unique except that it is the BAD movie of all time !!! DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!! WARNING!! DUMBEST FILM IF YOU WANT 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS USE !!! 1.10
