I do not know much about filmmaking, but good movies have to tell some kind of story ... your characters have to start and end their journey. They can do it in Last Exit to Brooklyn, but it's not satisfying, and I do not mean a happy ending, but ANY end. <br /> <br /> Last departure to Brooklyn, which took place in Brooklyn in 1952 for a very nice time, was a brutal labor strike, setting in motion a series of storylines. Most of them are some of the most unlikely characters ever to run on a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn does not bring these stories to a conclusion ... it leaves some ending without end or jumps into a bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. Two cases In the point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie) is hit by a car and killed. And that was it for him in the movie ... he finally disappeared, erased from the memory of all ... no reactions from friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread The stupid, unsuspecting and secretly gay strike leader, who was rejected by his worker, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets pounded by the thugs. The final scene of the brawl shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of the Nazi extermination camps ... and the scene continues ... and the camera pans onto the bodyguard of the labor leader, and he became crucified ... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course it's also for him ... clearing the brain ..... gone. <br /> <br /> Conclusion .... no matter what the critics originally said in 1989 about this movie ... This movie is a depressing piece of mud. Avoid it. And if you're not forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive physical, emotional, and sexual brutality. Do not even let the teens watch.
