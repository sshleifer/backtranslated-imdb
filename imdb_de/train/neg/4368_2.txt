This was brought to the DVD market by Alpha and is intended only for die-hard Boris Karloff fans (like moi). It is not a horror movie, but a drama in which Boris is a fighting scientist who agrees to kill the husband of a wealthy woman in order to gain the assets needed to continue his work. But as soon as the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing of his spouse, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It's satisfying enough to see Karloff as another selfish, weird guy, and some of the acting is unintentionally funny (especially from the internet) leading actress Mona Goya (the double crossed wife is a complete laugh) ). <br/> <br/> But be careful.
