The movie is pretty confusing and ridiculous. The plot is terrible ... but on the plus side, the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and shouts. Sharon Stone is fine this time ... not even half as good as the original mind. The murders are also not as bloody as the first, which is a pity. It is not the unpredictable chaos that everyone says it is. The sex is sometimes quite graphic, while others realize that he is fake (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes of banter and argument between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot turns a few times, but the end is terrible. The tension is always constant with a huge pile of "Oh my god!". The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and the settings and camera angles are impressive, bringing some class into an otherwise hurried movie. Sharon Stone is a bit old for that as well. The places where we see her breasts were a pleasure at first. This time they are too terrible to describe. The films themselves are rather average, but it's worth it. Mainly because the movie earns a lot of buzz. The opening sequence is a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first - leave it. Do not spoil the barrel. You will be glad you did not turn this stone.
