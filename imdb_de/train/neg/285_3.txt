It's not really about gymnastics; Swap out the occasional training sessions, and it might as well be about archery, microbiology, or a booger tournament. Instead, as with any other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that has flooded the '80s marketplace, it's about overcoming adversities with "stick-to-it-iveness" and making all social / personal realities irrelevant to your loneliness , Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, short; like a piece of cinema, it's all about the details. Some of the actors are bizarre enough to bring things to life, especially the love interest none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves gave you and warms up for Ted; Heroine Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie-dad and big-hair step-sister are more interesting than the sickly mother or her extremely sluggish bitch-teammates, one of which seems to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be appalled by the black comic reliefs, but on the other hand, they're at least in the movie. But D'Abo can not quite convince with her awkward girl, and since there is no other narrative focus, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself is really important. It's all just bodies running around, and not only is the result of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all done by an obvious double.
