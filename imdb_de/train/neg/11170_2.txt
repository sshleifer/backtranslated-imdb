There is a reason why this film, which was made for British television, first appeared at the 1977 Toronto Film Festival. It's boring, babbling and lacking in suspense. <br /> <br /> Peter OÃ•Tooles unruly performance and the performance of the playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest. <br /> <br /> Note: Some British film fans Philip Jackson, known for his portrayal of Inspector Japp in the television series Poirot, will enjoy one of his earliest roles.
