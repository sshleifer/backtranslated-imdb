If you hope for EVERYTHING, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual rendition of its predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but hopefully they were not serious when they did this thing. This whole movie is like producing the biggest hits DVD of the first three movies, but the change of actors. BHHAAAAD.
