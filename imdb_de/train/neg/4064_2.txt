This movie is extremely boring, it tells the story of a gas station owner and her life. Nothing happens exciting. The director has really "maintained" it and it feels like a camera following a woman while she lives her life. I had to watch other director's films for a class, the others were not so boring. This film was also considered a task ... it's worth boring to earn a good grade !! Do not watch the movie unless it is required. But do not miss out on other films by this director, because they are not so bad ... and other films about Africa are not. They are usually good, especially if they are made by a western director.
