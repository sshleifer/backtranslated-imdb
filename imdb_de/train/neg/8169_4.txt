The film begins with a couple of campers, a man and a woman, who are probably walking together in the vast wilderness. Sure enough, the man hears something and it hurts him so much that he examines it. Our killer greets him with a stab in the stomach. Then he chases the girl and cuts her neck. The camera in the opening scene is from the perspective of the killer. <br /> <br /> Next we meet our four main characters, two couples, one of whom is on the rocks. The men joke that the woman would never be able to handle the double dating alone, which caused the little blonde's ambitions to leave a week earlier. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car collapses. They arrive in the evening. When the men arrive, they are warned by a crazy Ralph Doppleganger about the disappearance of people in the forest. They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and a song of the eighties plays in the background with lyrics about murder in the dark forest. The men are losing themselves. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another The Burning clone, but a ghost story! The women, scared and lonely, cuddle up by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to look Tom. Well, they are obviously ghosts, as their voices echo! Her mother appears with blood from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they have seen their children before they disappear naturally. <br /> <br /> The kids run to daddy's house and tell him about the two beautiful ladies on the river. This causes a stir and he gets up and grabs his knife from the fireplace. "Daddy goes hunting," shouts the little girl with bad acting. It is obvious that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Through something in the woods, the blond blonde splits, blindly runs into the night and wears a knife. She meets the father, who explains that he is starving, and it will be quick. That makes no sense, because the Panther Growl has been around before (maybe he's allergic, are Panthers even honest in California?) She hurts him lightly before being stabbed in the head. A storm breaks out and the men seek protection, which turns out to be a dad. Obviously someone lives here because a fire is burning and something strange is burning over him. The children appear and warn them in front of dad, who appears shortly thereafter. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer is only following the women. He invites the men to eat and tells us the story of his former wife. We get a look back at his wife being caught cheating. The old man does not tell them he kills her and her lover, but daydreams about it. The reason for the demise of the children is not given to us. The men fall asleep and remain unhurt. The next morning, the men discover the empty campsite of their wives. After a short discussion they parted. One is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help. The one who drives back to his car breaks his leg. We are then reunited with the children when they explain to the surviving woman that they are spirits who have killed themselves because they are sad about their mother. They agree to help the woman connect with her friends <br /> <br /> The following scene defies the logic of the movie when dad kills the guy waiting in the campsite. He was also married or married to the blonde. Somehow the children realize he was murdered and tell the woman about it. She decides to see for herself and obviously meets the killer. Fortunately, the children let him stop by threatening to leave him forever. They know where that leads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie earns four out of ten stars and that's generous. Despite all concerns, the music is well done. It is also visible. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are well done. The story is incredible. There is such a thing as a willing abolition of unbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; I can not imagine the blonde taking off in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
