When I saw this in a shop, I found it very good and original. Like Wolfs Creek, Texas encounters a chainsaw massacre, and I mean, it only cost three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it was worth it. <br /> <br /> It seemed the directors - the 'butcher brothers' - could not decide if they wanted to make an artistic kind of horror or a bloody slasher scary. It ended with a clich√©d, bloody, sadistic hour and fifteen minutes in which all the characters were one-dimensional and did not care what happened to them, but to try to interest the audience for the characters, they ended up with a useless one Monologue added and the beginning of the film, to be completely honest, was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was really the middle / end - I will not ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> All in all, a pointless watch. It felt like a two-hour movie, but in fact it was only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, do not worry about it. If you want a Slasher movie, do not worry. The movie moves so slowly that nothing happens.
