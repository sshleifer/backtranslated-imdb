I bought it from Tower Records after seeing Info-Mercial at the Comedy Center about fifteen hundred times. I was really looking forward to seeing this. My God, where did I go wrong? Well, before I give my review, let me just say that I am a person who can find the good in all movies, hell I have over 1,500 DVDs! This is the underground comedy movie there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give him a chance, but not only was not it funny. It did not make sense, did not insult what it was, and was stupid all around. God, who thought with reason that these bastards are funny? that goes all the way down into the container ...
