There's nothing like watching giant robots fighting over a desert land, and Robot Wars delivers it. Sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is substandard and the characters are one-dimensional, but there are huge robots! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as good as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and instead use miniatures, so they have aged fairly well. His inadequacies are easily overlooked given the short running time of the films, and she has a certain humorous humor that makes her very gratifying in part. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi looking for distraction after a carefree hour.
