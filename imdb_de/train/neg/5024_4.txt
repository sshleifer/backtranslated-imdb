There is not much to say about that. Gammera is a type of fire turtle. He is unleashed by an atomic explosion. He goes ashore and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other garbage (oh yes, power lines, I almost forgot). Earlier, at the beginning of the movie, he makes friends with a little boy, and instead of just throwing away or crushing him, he puts him on the floor. For sure. From then on we have to watch as this chubby little Twerp shows up and runs away, shows up and runs away, shows up and runs away. For some reason, Gammera can hear this child from a distance of 20,000 meters. Well, it's the plan to try to get Gammera to a place where he can be put aboard a rocket and put into space. As usual, the monster is clumsy and uncoordinated (a man in a gammera suit). The Japanese army consumes (with the help of the Americans) enough ammunition and firepower to solve the sovereign debt, and of course that does nothing. You should know it anyway. We have seen many monsters in Tokyo. Not to throw them down because they can be fun, but it's really not very good.
