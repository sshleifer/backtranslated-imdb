After waiting so long, I finally had a look at this experimental Lynch ... and it was not worth it! Even for a die-hard lynch fan, I found that really boring ... <br /> <br /> Nothing happens, there are long, long, painful pauses in which nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches in which nothing is And the whole thing ends with the viewer not knowing or caring what it was, what happened before and what happened after that. <br /> <br /> There was an allusion to the Mulholland drive - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita-being and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to a major event that happened, though can not be clearly discussed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately everything is very uninteresting and boring, nothing happens, it is very forgotten and I think I will delete it from my computer and forget that I have looked at it. Sorry, David!
