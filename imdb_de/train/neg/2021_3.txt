Ronald Colman won an Oscar for Best Actor for a showy performance as a popular stage player, who completely loses himself in his roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically acclaimed by George Cukor, the film has a wonderful pedigree written by the esteemed team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the funny banter seems self-confident and the backstage business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has some nice moments with a hard waitress (when the theatrical Colman appeals to her breathlessly, she asks him: "What are you? Any kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, surprisingly boring and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
