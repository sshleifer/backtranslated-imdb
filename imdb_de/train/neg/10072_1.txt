Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the cinema for this flat, pointless film. My points; <br /> <br /> Film is based on two things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic Point of View: As with most American films, the author considers himself an expert after learning two or three things about Asian culture. Unfortunately, it is not enough. The knowledge of Kunefe and two names of other foods does not lead to a person understanding a culture. For example, shaving is a sign of a clean life in Asia, but everyone tried to stop the girl. The Lebanese are Christians (Ok, they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not do ethnocentrism. We do not judge people for their first question about our lives, as did the father figure in all the films. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is not much to say about that. Show me 10 girls who had this on their sexual awakening, as if I'm going to say I'm wrong. Please watch Dr. Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and focus the audience on the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film?
