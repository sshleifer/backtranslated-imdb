The film appeals to the public due to the broadcast of Ben Stiller and the fame of J. Aniston. It seems we have a recipe for a successful title here, but nothing is successful in this film. <br /> <br /> Polly is undoubtedly played very well by Aniston. This is the kind of character that suits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same annoying guy as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie, the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special. With these two well-paid actors, things could get a lot better - but what can they do if there's such a bad story and a bad script? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
