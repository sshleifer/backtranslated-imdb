I did not like this movie at all! First and foremost I do not know why, but everyone here says Clémence Poésy's play is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! She's not like Natasha: another gig, another character ... worse still, she's a very inexperienced actress, so she could not play that role! She disfigured the heroine completely! It was really disgusting to see her playing! In my opinion, it would be much better to transfer this role to a Russian actress because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man who did not shave for two weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thankfully, in this movie, there are some actors whose game was great !) that Alessio Boni has mastered his task very well! I was pleasantly surprised. He is one of the few who has read the book, which is very important for the piece. Also, I liked pieces of our Russian actors, which was really wonderful to see)) The only thing I liked about this work was very nice prospects and great clothes! My advice is to read the book and understand a true meaning, the goal with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps to realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
