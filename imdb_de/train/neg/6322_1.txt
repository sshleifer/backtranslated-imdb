This was one of the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of anti-nuke movies from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star could change the world is quite far-fetched considering how many, "children's peace marches" and "celebrity protests" were and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to TOTAL's nuclear weapons because some of Apparatchik's children were told of a "silent protest" The West is ridiculous. What ended the Cold War? America is tough, I can say "reaganesque" attitude and the internal failures of socialism. It was NOT the peace marches, the "die-ins" or films like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
