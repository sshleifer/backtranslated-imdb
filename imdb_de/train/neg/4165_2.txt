I'm a big fan of the camp, but if any shift in the storyline is predictable and bad, though it's obviously not trying to lose even the interest. I would rate this with a 3, but in the end it fell slightly by one point. The only salvation is that I hated other movies more. Not enough beer in the world for this.
