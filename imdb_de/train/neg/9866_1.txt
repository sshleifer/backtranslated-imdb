You want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good comments here seem to be written by (badly camouflaged) wrong third parties. The people who made this movie seem to be trying to synthesize false interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a successful mockumentary. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The movie is so vile that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject and finding it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important feature, but if you are ridiculed this way, you would have to hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its great taboo satire, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
