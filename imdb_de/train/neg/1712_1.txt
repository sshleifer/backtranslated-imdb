If Todd Sheets came out and admitted that this movie was going to fake the zombie genre, I would put my rating down. Imagine a movie in which every scene, line and even every nuance of acting was conceived as a parody. I could probably scratch out alphabet soup, rearrange the rest of the letters and still have a better script. When I think of this movie, I think of two scenes. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other dad go. I repeat, I go down a flight of zombies. This is a small flight of stairs, and although they brush against the falling undead, nothing happens to them. When they have reached the end, the ex-Marine turns around, says "God, you're a horny bastard" and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around it for about forty seconds while being surrounded by zombies. She then runs almost casually out of the crowd and joins the other people. SPOILER WARNING OVER! These scenes have to be seen to be believed. Still, I like this movie as much as any comedy, just because it's so damn funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets for so many people in his film and the urge to do it, but not really for anything else.
