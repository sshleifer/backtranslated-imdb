I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, he gets "no respect" from me. I only looked at it because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It's full of lame, rude jokes and a completely ridiculous conspiracy that has a developer (Dangerfield) aiming to build a ski resort in Utah that has not caught my attention at all. In addition to Dangerfield The film played a weak cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (high on the hill) John Byner (I did not know he was still there until I saw his name in the credits) /> This is really a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
