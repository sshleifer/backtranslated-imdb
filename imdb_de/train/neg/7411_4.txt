An interesting idea with an alternative dimension within a hospital. It remembered Stephen King's "Langoliers," "Kingdom Hospital," and old epilodes of the Twilight Zone. Atmospherically strong, the setup was great. There have also been some very clever 'time sweep' moments that always appeal to this attraction. The story had many vague clues, which led me to believe that all the subsequent aberrations of the times - ghosts / a weird batman and a pretty stupid, heavy metal-tested ghoul thing would be explained. And those were dark floors that let me down. From my point of view, the film does NOT state what lies behind the events. Although a certain ambiguity is always expected / welcomed in such films. Dark floors led to new heights of blur. I do not expect things that are wrapped up in a nice volume, but I should not feel like, "Huh? ... is that it? ... Did I lose weight, maybe I accidentally skipped chapters?" Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfactory suspicion, "It was all a dream", which is a pity, because I was very on board to the last role and enjoyed the movie.
