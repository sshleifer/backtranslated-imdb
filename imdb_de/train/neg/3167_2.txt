Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his reckless fiancé Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking for their reception at the last minute. It is the morning of her wedding and Kate is in a frenzy giving the caterers an insight into their demands for food presentation. Horror of Terror: Kate's "Angel" sculpture arrives without wings. In a subsequent fight with the sculptor, the heavy "ice cream" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the afterlife. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges a clairvoyant to tell the young veterinarian Kate would have wanted him to go out with other ladies and move forward. But the adorable medium Ashley (Lake Bell) is interested in Henry himself, much to the annoyance of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create chaos for Ashley, as she does not intend to get hold of another woman, Henry. Can you do something to bring Kate to heaven forever? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst that this dedicated fan ever saw. No, it's not the cast as they try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny like the cocky fiancé and Bell has an unusual style and humor that is also contagious. Biggs, a funny Thespian, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted actor (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please), he tries the very best, and in truth is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, his looks and his simple wit contribute significantly to make the movie bearable. But nothing can make a winner out of a thoughtless script and a terrible sense, absolutely nothing. So if you're a diehard fan of romantic comedy, think twice before giving up money on this money. Even if you get free tickets in the lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who love and love cinema.
