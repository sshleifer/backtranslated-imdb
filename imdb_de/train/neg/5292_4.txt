I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on an estate in South East London is evidently a violent Beckettian account of a Dante hell circle. At the center is Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of character before, but never so well. The movie begins by ordering drinks in a pub bar - and that's all - and you're already struck by the sense of frustration, self-contempt and barbarism that he shows in many different ways throughout the movie. It is an acting master class. <br /> <br /> Of course, Proud and Expropriates need a slide in a drama like this one, and Winstone is accompanied by Kathy Burke as his long-lived wife, who picks up on his unbearable behavior and eventually rejects it. Charlie Creed-Miles makes a good turn as a drug son, Billy, lit with spark plugs, though he sometimes wondered exactly what he was getting into. Gary Oldman explores the actors up close, maximizing the claustrophobia of their advice. 4.10
