When someone enters a movie of this type of film, it is not self-evident that overdosing this great over-the-counter medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, is very useful. Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman that Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw that this was a dumb gasp from "Hunh?" Where have I seen this before? It turns out, I've seen it before, but in a movie that was made much later than this one. DATE WITH ANGEL, a forgotten dirt dump from 1987 that benefited from the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart, who had no lines, wore a blond wig and made soap artist Michael Knight's life hell. In all conceivable angles with extremely low 80s values ​​much worse, but most likely an updated version of this turkey from 1942. Anyway, not to elaborate, this is not a memorable movie and stands as a doorstop information because it's the last time was that MacDonald and Eddy, not very good actors, but great singers, played together the "innocence" and "pure" romance they were known for. After that you may need a cold shower, not because there are steaming scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
