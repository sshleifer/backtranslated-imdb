It's hard to say what the worst thing about this show was: bad acting, bad acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, inappropriate sets for the time, the bad script. It would have been nice if the script of the original story had followed a bit closer - there's enough excitement and good material in Beowulf to provide a lot of good material and a better story than the scriptwriters could do with it /> <br /> And why to introduce a weird new weapon like a crossbow firing explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was shot in "only" 21 days. This is reflected in the lack of quality. I begin to think that this is a general (bad) attitude that the sci-fi channel (and others) has adopted in recent years in terms of producing classic-style films. What a waste !
