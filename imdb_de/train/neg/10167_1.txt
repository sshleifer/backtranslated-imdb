This TV movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw that was the KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played and we see that the scenes behind the scenes basically do not see anything. With the many stars in this film, it made no difference. I really do not know why I saw that.
