This is another Northeast Florida production that was mainly filmed in and near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach until the street scenes were reached. The movie is pretty and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but over the top. Eileen Brennan trumps even more. Good for small children or for those who like lint in large cans. A 4 from the Miller Movies formula.
