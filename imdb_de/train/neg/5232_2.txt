Becky Harris plays the shopper, whose misfortune is to be in the store at the wrong time, and it's obviously ONLY the purpose to be in this movie, to give a reason to carry remote controls! Miss Harris seems to be in her fifties or older when she comes on stage for the first time. Once the redheaded bat is done with her, it becomes clear that this is not an AARP queen. If this is not one of the most beautiful elements ever shown on celluloid, I want someone to let me in on it. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally blew my VHS copy and captured its charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is really not worth mentioning. I had hoped to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but was disappointed on both counts. God bless Becky Harris!
