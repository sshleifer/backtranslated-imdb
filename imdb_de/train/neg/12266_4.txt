Republic images come late in the game to the genre "werewolf" or Werecat. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long overseas trip, during which he developed jungle fears during which he had power outages. He is received with great success because his novel, which is parallel to a notorious process, is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, which is more likely if an official is killed by a "catman". The suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc√© is dead. The matter is complicated by the return of blackouts, so the author does not know if he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> Okay, Thriller is too leisurely to fully enjoy him. There are too many musical numbers too early and too much dead time when talking to each other in the middle and in later sections. The drama is okay and the sets are pretty good, but there's a reason why most people I know remember only the best headgear killer. Despite its short running time (just over an hour), I believe that the film was rarely seen on television, that one loses patience after 20 minutes. As good as the conversation is, I just wish someone would do something. When it finally happened, it was too late in the final minutes. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
