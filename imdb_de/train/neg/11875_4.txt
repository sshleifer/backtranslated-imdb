Mmm, does not a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves above. Take a bite. Mmmmmmmm Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. ISS it, you !!! Shovel it down the throat until your face turns green with nausea. You just had the experience with Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of '98 and was immediately enthusiastic. Like this pile of pancakes, I devoured it. But the enjoyment eased off quickly, as the Ally McBeal character (whom we at first glance see as adorable and endearing) soon becomes the most annoying, unsafe, whining summoner you've ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer that my female spines have a spine.) The gags and gimmicks of the show are also chopped off, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which really squeezes into her face) becomes scratchy and the incessant Character changes & rewrites make the show a damned soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show in small doses and finish it as soon as it gets annoying (and so will). I made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment got totally mad. It was good as long as it took, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it just got ugly after it had passed his reception. <br /> <br /> Next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like the fruit cup. It will sit much better with you.
