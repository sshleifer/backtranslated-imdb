Sometimes a movie is so horrible that it destructively influences morality. You really start to wonder, what does it mean to our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can you honestly expect us to endure so many stereotypes and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, Hollywood is still an important role in making the GUN the protagonist, the plotter and the source of all conflict and resolution in movies. Character needs a weapon. Get a weapon. Can not because he has a weapon. First he puts down his weapon. Oh my god, what will we do? He has a gun! He waves around and behaves more evil than real people. He puts it in someone's face for 90 minutes and asks questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the soothing sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It's a real challenge to get such a tired, worn-out formula working again. A movie has to be very smart and well done. This one is not. It has no life and no personality and it will suck you these components. You feel BAD when you live in the time and space you do. Really, who needs that !? So yes, I say it: I think that could be the worst movie I have ever seen. Anyone involved in the production of this garbage should publicly embarrass himself for the evil service he has done to all of us.
