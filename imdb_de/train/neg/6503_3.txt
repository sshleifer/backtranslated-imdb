What Hopkins does with his efforts as a writer and director gives us the feeling that we know absolutely no one in the film. Maybe that's the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and very deeply drawn from the inside, but it's so impersonal. There are no signs. We never know who someone is, so there is no investment on our side. <br /> <br /> It could be a screenwriter mixing with his own characters. Is it? Could be. I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean, there is no telling. Hopkins movie is an experiment. At first glance, one could cite the case that it is a budding scriptwriter who realizes, at the moment of his fate, that life is hit and miss and / or success is a blind coincidence, as he becomes in a slipstream "hurled by collisions between times, dreams, thoughts and reality. Still, it's so tirelessly cerebral that it leaves no room for emotion, even in the tiny, rather rudimentary scale that allows us to connect with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think about Nippy and the flamboyant school of the rickety machine gun-mounted camera and the editing triggered me, but as I think about the movie, I'm beginning to realize it's a lot to do with it had to do. There are so many films in the last decade where the cuts or camera moves have sound effects and other technical Doodads that degrade the atmosphere. I suppose in that case it was justified that it was the impressionistic response of dreams. However, I hardly knew anything about Slipstream when I saw it, and I came out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins did not try to interest us. There are interactive films, and there are films that sit and knit in a rocking chair without being aware of your presence. Slipstream is the latter.
