I stupidly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago and said to myself, "Funny, Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose?" I paid $ 15.99 plus tax. I brought it to a house of friends and we were both horrified at how bad it was written and acted. Wood performances abound. All the "weird" and "outstanding" ideas that were promised never seemed to arrive. After 90 minutes, I put my head in disgrace and knew I could never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I almost cried, because if what could be described as "comedy", I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I kept telling a friend about the horror of this movie so he just had to see it to understand how bad it was. During Christmas time, I saw him with him this year because he did not want to see it alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because when I saw, I just got angry. I started yelling at the movie, and I'm not the one involved with movies. Anyone I know he even saw this movie agrees that the worst thing they've ever seen is. My sense of humor is sick and often offends and offends my friends, but that could not even save this movie. The fact that this movie is not in the bottom 100 list of IMDb is amazing. The fact that its rating (at the time of this publication) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
