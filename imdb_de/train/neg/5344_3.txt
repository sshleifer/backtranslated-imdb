You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (apart from the songs). Well, their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes the same mistake when he puts S Club (another of my favorite bands) in his own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt, and Rachel Stevens (what happened to seventh member, Paul Cattermole?), Basically ask their boss for a break, they go on and on while they are there to see themselves on TV! Three of them swap and, conversely, half discover that they are clones made by a greedy scientist and the other half are in trouble. With Gareth Gates as a Clone of Itself. This film may have more action than the Spice Girls movie, but aside from the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin '" and "Never Had A Dream A True "This is not a valid reason to watch this movie. Not too long after the band finally broke up. Appropriate!
