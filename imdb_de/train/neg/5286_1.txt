I'm a big Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie on Amazon.UK so I could see it without ever waiting for it to come to the US. I should have saved my money. What is Anne doing with Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was calm and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, did she have a stroke or something? Her language was neither normal nor normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters that made their entire "romance" absolutely incredible. In the final scene, they even wear Sally Hawkins, who wears the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, though despite their shortcomings, they were pretty close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. This is a sort of Cliff's Notes movie from Persuasion. Meet all the highlights without explaining anything.
