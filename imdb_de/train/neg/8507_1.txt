I agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. Rented it with the idea that it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier were there. I was surprised by their performance, more expected as they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start, but it got worse. I even laughed about bad stunts !! when should a puzzle film be. You can even guess who the killer is !!! <br /> <br /> For what really happened? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, but do not mind that you waste time and money. <br /> <br /> Boring !!!
