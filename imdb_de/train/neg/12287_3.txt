In the late '80s, there was an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror movies shown in gloomy prisons. Renny Harlin's excellent, hearty and moody "Prison" got the whole hunted Hoosegow ball rolling; Immediately afterwards followed the clearly inferior "The Chair", John Saxons pleasing trashy "Death House", the walk-in psycho-image "Destroyer" and this terribly spongy exercise in hopeless comedy. <br /> <br /> Their usual annoying assortment of horribly unsympathetic student minds headed by an unbearably agonizing, tormenting Twerp Alex (the most unappetizing Nicholas Celozzi) goes to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances that have plagued them Coming up with the sudden cruel death of up and down coming rock star Sammy Mitchell (bored played by Toni Basil of "Hey Micky") Alex's brother is obsessed with the evil demonic spirit of a malignant US Civil War cannibalistic commander and makes the expected murder rush and forces Alex to overcome his passivity and face this ghastly ghost. <br /> <br /> Although photographed by Nicholas von Sternberg with some neat bits and a rather spooky atmosphere (filmed on-site in the gloomy, rusty, rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island), "Slaughterhouse Rock "Do not cut it as a solid, effective fear feature.

In other words, this stinker manages to make it sad for just under 90 minutes to appear like a painful cinematic jail sentence.
