I had passed this title 15 or 20 times in blockbuster and looking for something reasonably decent. All I can say is that they were all reasonably decent movies the night I rented them. <br /> <br /> I'll praise it for being more jumpy than "Dracula 3000", but in reality that's pretty easy to say since it did not have Caper Van Dien in it. Other things missing in Pik were: an interesting cast, an interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I think you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ...), he flew from mine colonies to mine colonies and tried to wipe out all the vampires he found could. The crew consists of: the daring, ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early), his hitherto inexperienced first, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (no typo), a wannabe cowboy, and a REALLY, REALLY Asian command, a "tough guy" female ... it almost sounds like the cast of MTV's "The Real World". After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a lot of bloodsuckers (and it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy), his first comrade takes over ... blah, blah, blah, all hate him. bla, bla, bla ... I could go on, but like I said, it's the same story used in about a hundred other "films" of this genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still no typo) was pretty hot, but if you're waiting for her to discover more than just her decollision, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say It was the worst movie I ever saw when I actually rented Starship Troopers 2, but wait until it appears on the sci-fi channel.
