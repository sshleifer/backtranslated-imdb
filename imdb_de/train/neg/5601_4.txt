I just looked at it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and presented to Claudio Cassinelli, an actor that I like. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that convicted prisoners would fight to death for TV ratings has been exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner, and the new movie Death Race, which will surely be shitty I'm here because it's Jason Statham playing. <br /> <br /> This was for the most part just a bore. The action "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. The "training" was a slumber party. It just never grabbed me and made me look after someone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others and you'll be better off.
