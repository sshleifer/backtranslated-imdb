I read the story of John Everingham in Reader's Digest years ago, and I remember thinking what a great movie that would be. And it would have been likely if Michael Landon had never got his hands on it. For me, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, and his artistic license surpassed the top, much like his massacre of the Little House book series. Acting is abhorrent for lack of a better word, the script is sloppy and Landon's Puss gives more close-ups than should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the history of Everingham as well as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects that the books were "founded". It's just another vehicle to show Landon's gruesome hair.
