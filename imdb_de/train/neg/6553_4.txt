Years after the fall of the last big corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are being harvested for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a doctor in the desert to hear that she is pregnant. Fleeing from Recyclers (bounty hunters chasing cyborgs), Cash seeks out Cytown, the legendary cyborg haven. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (and last) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. Originally scheduled as a continuation of MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, the first film quickly became a standard post apocalyptic martial arts festival that became a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that surpassed its predecessor but was not seen too often (and was rejected by the few who considered it cheap food). <br /> <br /> This film tries to be a mix of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action movie, while the second was a clever cyberpunk story), but unfortunately unfortunately on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, with the movie being filmed in desert deserts (like so many post-apocalyptic action movies of the 1990s) and filmed in old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The film's story revolves around a plot device that's as interesting as it is absurd for a pregnant cyborg (this movie is not the first to try this idea, using the anime OVA ARMITAGE III series) to a greater extent). But the movie falls into the same trap that so many low-budget science-fiction action films fall victim to, in the fact that the hooks (synthetic organisms) are nothing more than androids. The visual effects are nothing more than prosthetic arms and make-up effects. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty normal for this type of movie, with lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the worst actress to be shown. Instead of rejoicing at the news that she is pregnant, she seems whiny and grumpy. Your co-stars are much better. Malcolm McDowell is the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes in which he appears. Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as a boss villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, who plays Lynch's right hand, who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & his prequel.
