I'm sure the people on the Texas-Louisiana border must have had one or two good laughs when Paramount's B-picture unit inflicted that unit on the wartime audience. Quite simply the area on the Sabine River where the movie begins is cotton land, just like the rest of the deep south, or at least the deep south after the Civil War. There are no big cattle empires, they are much farther west in Texas than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to build their empire. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the two partners in a river boat and if Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services by not paying them to transport his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that's the beginning of the big Ponderosa Ranch they start. Along the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford, and feuds with his much smaller neighbors. They also have some more stakes with Leo Carrillo. Anyway, we Easterners who like westerns do not usually bother with geographic details, and it's still a good western from the production facility of Harry Sherman, who has all produced these Hopalong Cassidy Westerns for Paramount. The climax is a blazing blow, and I mean, literally, a firefight that might have been used for an A production. <br /> <br /> But I would not have western fans.
