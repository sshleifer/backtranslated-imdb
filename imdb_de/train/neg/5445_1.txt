Ooof! This one was a stinker. It's not somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller, that's for sure. In reality, it is somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! Video and Captain EO, only with a not so big budget and a lot more close-ups of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon plays the front and center, while the rest of the band tries to hide the fact that they've stolen their entire career from Roxy Music's last three albums. Short clips by Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs. (Anyway, I liked the role as they played "Hungry Like The Wolf", but why was a tiger lurking in the audience turned into a tiger-striped woman? "Hungry like the tiger" is a wolf! Whatever A DVD of Duran Duran's 80's videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia
