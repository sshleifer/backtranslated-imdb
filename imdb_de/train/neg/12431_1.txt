I want to say that curiosity made the best of me. If I had just seen a trailer, I could tell you the entire plot of the movie. I could have saved the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a catastrophe just waiting to happen, and it's an embarrassment to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this child's radio-controlled racing car drives everywhere in the neighborhood and even enters this house. It is even covered with clothes. Is not it reasonable to believe that a remote can not send a signal under these circumstances? Obviously, Hollywood did not believe it. Common logic and every concept of electronics dictates the opposite. I doubt the race car could even have reached the road, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that the criminals possess. Why are these criminals in all these movies rocket scientists until they find an eight-year-old? The child should be the smartest person in the film, rather than professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. In addition, the leader puts down his real pistol and "accidentally" attacks a plastic pistol; Apparently he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove you should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; There are other senses than seeing. The traps are also unrealistic; If one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood wants us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who believes they have seen a really bad movie. The movie they've seen appears Citizen Kane compared to this movie. Otherwise, skip this for reasons of pride. Alone at home 3 raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he write them too?
