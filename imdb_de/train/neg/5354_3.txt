Absence of a GOOD PLOT, absence of decent action, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of decent looks. SPECIAL EFFECTS ... do I have to continue? Review MAY contain SPOILER. The actors seem to read their lines, and not very well. Most "actors" behaved like in a second play. The story seems to have been written by one of the above-mentioned second graders ... it's not all that confused ... it's just so simple and stupid that a person thinks they have to miss something to make them hurt. No, that's not it, it's just as easy as you think. I understand the "movie", so I know he's STUNK! Most of the movie people sat around (they read their lines) and tried to look weird. The narrator was ANNOYING. The "special effects" were LACHBAR. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can say that they were not paid or not paid much because neither their heart nor their talents were there. I LOVE Tony Todd ... but he was only appropriate in this movie. In fact, the achievement of Tony Todd is the ONLY reason I gave him 3 stars ... and Tony was only there for TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest to fast-forward the DVD to the two-minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this "movie," I would have been P.O.'D and reclaimed my money. Hopefully, the people who did that will do better next time.
