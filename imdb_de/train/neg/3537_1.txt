Convinced the world that he did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that many people probably remember. Of course, The Usual Suspects in relation to Kaiser Gold. I mean Sose. <br /> <br /> I've got one more: - The stupidest trick a director has ever done was trying to convince an audience that he really did have a story- <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the saddest pieces I've seen in a long time. It starts so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very intelligent premise. But unfortunately, the film only leads to self-destruction. And not with a single punch, but with nagging little wrists. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments, who are surprised that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the existence of humanity to a very plausible degree. I've seen and read about a dozen completely different ways in which people explained the story. And they vary from a story that plays completely in the mind of a player, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way in which a criminal plays off his enemies with similar means as chess. <br /> <br /> And that's all happy swell. But at the same time, it's a painful message that something terribly wrong with this story. Besides, it's definitely a dull rip-off of movies and books like Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia, and Shachnovelle. And we are not dealing here with a kind of bond It is a blatant robbery. <br /> <br /> What ultimately goes wrong in this movie is that the action swirls like a drunken bum on speed. If this movie had been a roller coaster ride, you would have been in an accident. The attraction next to it shortly after taking off: There are so many twists in this film that will never be resolved, and if it's a cocktail, you'd have to go to the Drinking a LOT of Supplies of Sling Buckets to Work on the Nausea Nothing is explained, and when you finally know which way you think it will go on you will be drawn into another. <br /> <br /> I think this story was nowhere on paper and Ritchy on I thought it would be awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, to be the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely hurt your own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could have been a jewel instead becomes an artificial work of art, a topic of discussion for pseudo-intellectuals that can be debated on Sunday afternoon debating clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
