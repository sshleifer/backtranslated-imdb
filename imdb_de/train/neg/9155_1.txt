This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It was like a "homework assignment" for a film class. When it comes to the "message" it tries to send, it completely fails. Characters are exaggerated, bad behavior and conspiracy ... Well, it's absolutely ridiculous. The cover picture made me think that it could be a decent movie, the co-star is good-looking, and that's it. Moral of this movie: NEVER EVALUATE A FILM THROUGH THE IS! Save time, money and energy and make your own home movie, and you'll be way better than me. It was painful to look at and honestly I am surprised that someone would spend money on producing and selling it!
