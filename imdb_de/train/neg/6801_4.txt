First, I will not tell you why I rented this movie because I'm still confused myself. <br /> <br /> Air Rage resembles a movie I've ever seen where a plane was hijacked. There's an important person on the plane, of course, and the hijacker is looking for revenge. The sad is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other films. Are we really so unoriginal so fast? <br /> <br /> Although it's Ice-T (who inexplicably makes painful attempts to make ACTING while he's not busy putting the "c" in front of the rap), who is? Cover glorifies cover, the film actually shows the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess, which is 'surprisingly' overlooked by the five hijackers, which of course causes them to pursue them. For the rest of the cast, Steve Hytner was the only person I knew as "Kenny Bania" from "Seinfeld." I can not forget to skip my favorite part The movie when a kidnapper used a POUND PLASTIQUE to blow a lock from a door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script - disgusting. It came to the point where I could say something that I thought would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> As far as special effects are concerned ... the only thing that's special About this movie I've wasted the electricity bill to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the movie took place in the air. But because of the less outstanding achievements, the only anger in the movie was that of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to take a movie apart just because it's bad. Please save yourself, do not choose this.
