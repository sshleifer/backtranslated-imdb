I would not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's biggest fans. He is, however, an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is listening to Leonardo's reflections on his own life and career. Warming and modesty. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately most of the musicians of the concert did not support the nuances of Leonardo's musical / literary style. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard appreciated the interpretations of Rufus Wainrights for his songs. <br /> <br /> What failed most in this documentary was the filmmaker's ability to let the viewer see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. Much is said in this regard, but the viewer is not attracted to the person Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident in the interviews with Bono and the Edge.

And just like the rest of the film, only Leonard Cohen remains in his role and can report on his own role. <br /> <br /> The entire montage and script are similar to an extramural high school project. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flash images is poorly placed. Part of the camera work is bleak. Part of the score hardly reminds of associations that I might have expected.

At first he can not remember the name of the genre until he finally says it's punk, and the punkers have really recorded his music. The next scene in the movie is a live cover of "I can not forget it" ... <br /> <br /> "And I can not forget, I can not forget that I can not forget it, but me do not remember anything who "
