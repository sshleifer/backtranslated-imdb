It just seems strange that someone has read this script and thought, "That's funny, I mean, it's so weird it just has to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she the person who is really responsible? Is it you who owe my time to me, more than the director / author? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in almost every possible way. There is no good dialogue and sympathetic character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst movie of all time, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred" - this to a considerable extent. It almost seems to be a Shakespeare in comparison. <br /> <br /> The end is filled with several minutes of outtakes and is still under 80 minutes. The outtakes include performers who laugh at the "weird" mistakes they made and things that went awry on the set of this "comedy." I'm glad to see someone laughing somehow connected to this 'movie'. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing. It just goes on and on. It is really so lame. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. It's so bad that it's ... something, but I do not know what, and hopefully I'll never find out about this wannabe movie. But that really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
