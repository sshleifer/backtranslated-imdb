I was not sure how to rate this movie because it was so bad that it was actually very funny. I'm not a Gackt fan, even though he's talented, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the subject here people. This movie is ridiculous. It's so exaggerated and nonsensical, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no action except for vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this movie almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3. There were too many ideas that did not leave enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were ridiculous. Edited quickly, almost hard to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's the only release of this movie. I'm a fan of good action movies, but the action was terrible. Although the last shootout was ok and was the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie. <br /> <br /> It always jumps between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, an action movie or a horror or a romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you crazy, why? Because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not fool yourself, this movie is bad.
