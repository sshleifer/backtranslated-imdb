This was a sweet movie to the end. The end was just another despicable effort to disempower men and strengthen women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic, and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose the man who eventually relinquished his power and control over the relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she was sitting in the car behind the driver's wheel when they drove off at the end, after begging her and pleading with her to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who believe that they are responsible for all men and their relationships with them. That's why it was a despicable movie.
