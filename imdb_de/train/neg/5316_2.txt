Throw this lame dog a bone. Sooo bad ... you can still watch. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic villain who is not vaporized by an avid spaceship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crashes on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring the villain back dead or alive. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park keeper who calls to deal with these two visitors from afar. Costumes are unheard of and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent sure took the money and ran away. The law shows the only sign of the effort. It's so funny that it's so funny. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
