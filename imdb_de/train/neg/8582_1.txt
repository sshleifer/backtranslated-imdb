As a sort of sequel to The Full Monty about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is a fake. <br /> <br /> As someone who was born in Sheffield and still has ties to the city, I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Someone said it could have been in Oklahoma, and that sums it up for me. This looked like a romantic view of the north of England for the US market. Probably many Americans - and many English from the South - do not know that Sheffield is a big city with about half a million inhabitants and a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants, it was portrayed as a gloomy, semi-rural town where everyone in Sheffield seemed to be drinking in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the idea of ​​a folk in a village hall line-dance was a doppelganger. This was a small, tight-knit community, not a metropolis. The workers of the Sheffield working class were completely different from their real counterparts, who are usually silent and communicate dryly in grunts and short words. They do not chatter and do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even the rural areas that are said to be in the Peak District looked alien to me. I recognized some places I had hiked, but some of the aerial photos of pylons that stretched across a desolate landscape reminded me more of Wales. In fact, at the end of the credits, I found a clue to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District travels in the summer with hikers and tourists in cars. It lies between two big cities. It is not a kind of wilderness. <br /> <br /> As for the idea of ​​a young woman falling in love with Pete Postlethwaite and falling in love, that was ridiculous and could only have been a male dream. Her reasons to become his lover were never apparent. None of the men was referred to as a partner or as a family member. They existed in a vacuum. Anyone who wanted to see a movie about unemployed Sheffielders would have been misled. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its bourgeois writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a huge fake! <br /> <br />
