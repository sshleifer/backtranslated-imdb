Oh the Eighties, a time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a bunch of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away comedies. At the time I could not believe such movies as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) At the box office have earned wing agenda and they have dated very badly. TROMA`S WAR is a joke on these kinds of movies, but you have to wonder if they need spoofing at all? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks sophistication - though it makes no real difference between real tyrants and left wings - and sometimes feels more like a Z-class movie than a send-up. Maybe it is ?
