We all know what it's like to have a bad day in the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks like it's the worst day ever when you try to get into the office. Sometimes it's just not worth knowing what I mean? And sometimes it just is not worth doing anything if it was done before 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> It's not that Steve Martin is an idiot comedian or wrong for the role of a stressed-out and stressed-out advertising man; On the contrary, in both points. And it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally incapable. Her work has been good, if not great, ever since I first saw her on TV by Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all: it's really about New York and why should anyone come to New York to live and live their life in married bliss love? Type of ?? in the largest city in the world. That's if you're a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the movie from 1970 is still an excellent comedy that realistically explores all things that can go wrong if you travel somewhere, and most of them contain the situations and viewing objects you can imagine that can happen to you in a strange environment. Unfortunately, this version of 1999 goes into unfounded tangents designed specifically for an audience that expects or wants to overkill. For example, not satisfied with the star appeal of the main actors, there is a (relatively long) cameo by Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York, as we all know. What? Giuliani chose the president even then? Worse? a talking ad for the friendly face of New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese playing his role as Basil Fawlty again? but this time as a prancing crossdresser ?? once again worried hotel staff, the sycophantically attracted the rich customers and usually made himself look like the idiot he is. And while the memory of Fawlty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, badly damaged, is not ... <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made in 1999? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. When it was founded in 1970, this was the city you saw: bleak, dark, moody, disturbing, and not the place the molested couple ended up for their new life in the Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all) had chosen. , Things had gotten better in 1999: Glitter was back, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready for you if you had the Moxie ... <br /> <br /> Well, of course, the couple in this Coming second, this moxie finds in himself and eventually joins the fabulous struggle to continue the American dream of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. So this movie is really weird, but not for reasons the producers might imagine. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy, this movie is a much better travesty with the great Jack Lemmon. If you have seen the latter, do not bother.
