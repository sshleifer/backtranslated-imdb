Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie, but Prom Night is much better and this movie about how the Prom Queen Mary Lou is killed by her boyfriend in 1957 and comes out of revenge 30 years later. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside and The Movie Stars other OK actors and actresses like Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good gore scenes like Mary Lou killing the girl trying to hide in her locker. Shattering the lockers and one of the students is sitting at the computer, and Mary Lou kills him to death. All in all an OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
