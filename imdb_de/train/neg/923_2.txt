For some reason, different young couples are wandering through the Italian Alps to see who can get their camping name first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and is taken possession of the spirit of "Tyranus" as he sets up a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the movie in the woods chasing his friends and chopping off his limbs to add some stew to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This full version of Shot-on-Digital is stupid, meaningless, has terrible drama and sound, and the (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it is quite high on the unintentional salmon scale, mainly thanks to the revised lead performance. Whether you're using the cheap-looking armor object that wields a sword or spits neurotic Latin gibberish on demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and uncomfortable lines have to be believed. Well, at least he is not as boring as most other actors.
