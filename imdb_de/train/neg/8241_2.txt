This movie has many issues that make it look like a low-budget project by someone in film school. But I have to acknowledge it for its fighting spirit. I often laughed hysterically throughout the movie. It was so bad sometimes that it was funny what made it a funny watch. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a low-grade Slasher movie with a touch of psychological horror and a dash of Campy ridicule, pop in a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is almost impossible to track and the soundtrack is somehow there.
