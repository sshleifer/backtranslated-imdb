What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this rebuild. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this movie. Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for her. The musical background I have to say did not go with AT ALLLLL's story and it's amazing how you can find those directors who have absolutely no life for a well-balanced and balanced movie. I hope that no such dreadful director could ever destroy such a great classic in the future. This movie should not have been done. Advice to all who have seen it, please tell me that I am right because I could not possibly be the only spectator who did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
