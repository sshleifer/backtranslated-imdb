The most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was completely irrelevant, and acting was the worst thing I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles were used to make me sick, the random music was dreadful and drowned out the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing), and the San Francisco footage looked like they would have been stolen directly from the promotional video of the city's tourist board. Oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half succeeded. Next time, please, better light.
