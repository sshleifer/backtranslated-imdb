Even if it is a TV production, there is no excuse for the best results of the final product. This movie had a budget and had a casting department. So, if you are making a movie about a true life story and actually writing "The Real Story" in the title, should not you try and capture realism? First of all, this film is absurdly occupied. These actors are in TV soaps during the day, or in those ridiculous Lifetime Channel movies, not a gangster / crime story. Everything about them, from their looks to their manners, screams only from the generation of the '90s shopping mall old-rock listeners. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and it sounds like 90%. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow ever said the words, "I'm out of here." It's like a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans gathering and deciding to make a real "Kewl movie" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one who would be totally crazy and rocking. Well, this sticker does not even rank on the wheel and rock scale. Everything that can be wrong with any movie is wrong, from casting to acting to editing and music. Every single thing is absolutely wrong ... and it is annoying that those responsible for this cruel turkey had the nerve to put "the true story" in the title. It's certainly NOT the true story, but worse, it's not even an entertaining popcorn movie that's accepted on its own terms. As I noted in my headline, it is simply indescribably horrible on every level imaginable. Trust me or watch at your own risk.
