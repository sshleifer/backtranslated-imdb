The fight scenes are slow-motion Jackie Chan and the jokes are pathetic (by far the worst pun: "Do you know what? I've heard you coming this time"). The stars are a mismatched couple: Brandon Lee, in spite of the horrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charms - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free from (at least in this film). Note to the director: Stay away from love scenes in the future, especially if your main actress does not do nudity and you have to rely largely on a body double. (* 1/2)
