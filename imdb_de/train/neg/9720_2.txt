This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> It tries to copy some borrowed effects to a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard. Guillaume Canet does not convince (I almost never found him very convincing), his dad plays very badly in the movie, the story is stupid, the end is .. stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I have not liked a movie since "le pacte des loups" (Brotherhood of the Wolf) by Christophe Gans (and I see / see about 80-100 films a year), but At least this movie had some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here (only rated), and when I saw the review and the comments, I thought I'd have to write something down. <br /> <br /> I think we will not have any problems selling the DVD offered to us: not so bad a movie in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I'm open (I watch SF, Western, Drama, Comedy, Silents, Horror, Fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one and a half hours.
