I read the book a long time ago and I do not remember the plot, but I remember that I liked it. Since I'm sick on the couch at home, it seemed like a good idea and Hey! It's a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> The female cast comes directly from Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show, but there are many commercials for the show and I understand the core. Is there nothing more original? Safe, but not for the lifetime. <br /> <br /> The male actors all look pretty effeminate and work, but the girls probably need husbands. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a woman fights with a man for her life, and what does she do ??? Kick him in the testicles. What else? Women love that, but let me tell girls something ... It's not as easy as it always is. <br /> <br /> It was not all bad. I got the shivers one or two times, so I have to credit somebody.
