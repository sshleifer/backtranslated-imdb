It is so sad that the Romanian public is still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals enjoying this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, so superficial and brutal as the "Garcea" series or the "Vacanta mare" children's games Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such artisans never expect to call their shows "art". Pintilie, who made a very good film 40 years ago ("Duminicà la ora sase"), followed by another movie ("Reconstituirea"), trying to explain his film length as "works of art" - but unfortunately he masters this a lot to a limited level the specific cinematographic means of expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again provides an example of "HOW NOT" - this is just the only benefit.
