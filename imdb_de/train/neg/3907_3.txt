I'm glad I hired this movie for a reason: its inadequacies made me read Allende's book and learn the full story. Pros: The movie is beautiful, the period is good and consistent (to my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do a good job. <br /> <br /> Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I've always wondered if there's something wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the awful English way he says "Transito.") Winona Ryder does not do anything credible except to look young and idealistic. Most other performances are fine, but in the character sheets and relationship development so few things are related that I was frustrated and angry long before the end. <br /> <br /> I am now very curious if this film is typical of Bille August's work. Maybe I'll have to drop a few bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.
