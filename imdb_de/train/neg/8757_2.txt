Allegedly a movie that predicts the upcoming trends in British pop music is wrong on so many fronts that it is ridiculous. Tommy fast? The honeycombs? The film features a song by the Spencer Davis group, two of the Animals, and a live Beatles film that make their live version of Twist and Shout (every 1:20). But all in all an awkward display of British music around 1964. Oh, and Hermans recluse.
