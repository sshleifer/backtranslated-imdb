Non-existent conspiracy, tons of poorly targeted / super-cheesy scenes (snipers / world-famous snipers who can not even hit their target a few feet away) plus what's up with the end? Carnival shooting? WTH?), Technical bugs (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a bell? 100+? These people shoot their weapons without reloading). The movie is so bad that even an older Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this garbage. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie (I realized that I wasted a good 100 minutes of my life.) precious life in this regard). Hopefully, the director would either stop making films or learn more about his next film.
