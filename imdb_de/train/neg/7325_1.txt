As a result, the actors in Hollyoaks act like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie shows how horrible he is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough. I want to find those responsible for this disaster and slap them in the face. I will never get that time back. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless film? I could not imagine a procedure that would relieve the boredom. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful piece of cinema. What can you say more than to repeat how truly awful the spectacle is. Please avoid
