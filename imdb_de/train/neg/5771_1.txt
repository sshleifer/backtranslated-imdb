I apologize to the filmmakers for using the terms "filmmaker", "movie" or "movie" in this context, but "criminals" and "crimes against humanity" are a bit harsh. <br /> <br /> The writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The director: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The spectacle: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too incapable of words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills that have brought this atrocity: NO, EVEN HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This garbage can hardly be called a cinema. The majority of family home videos are closer to this award than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a 10-car traffic jam being captured on video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the plot in this test because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let's just say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call the actor one-dimensional would bring them recognition. What is little, is at first cruel and is much worse by the terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, however, would be, apart from the plot, the effect ... or rather the disturbing absence of it. There are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and the few sound effects were either "normal" cannon sounds or they were made by mouth (yes, you read that correctly). The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a "shh" for the elevator doors; I think he felt it sounded more futuristic. Finally, this should be discontinued in 2031. However, this does not explain the sounds he made for the fistfighting scenes with his mouth. If it was not bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted) on the video camera (and it shows), the use of stick-gun sounds was almost worse than no sounds at all use. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a flock of sheep, and they are just as awkward. Imagine: The villain enters an office building and searches for his prey. A lady runs out of fear. He raises his weapon (a Uzi) and shakes it. We hear a noise that is clearly not Uzi. The woman walks away from the camera and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (she looks like she was hit by a paintball) and she falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that my description of the inability of the actual sequence will do much justice. <br /> <br /> In another sequence that almost - but not quite - makes the movie funny enough to watch, it takes place in a staircase. The villain chases the good guys and the lady he protects down the stairs and shakes his plastic Uzi. Maybe you want to duck. There are badly tuned sound effects that go everywhere. <br /> <br /> I suppose Alan DeHerrera can not be locked away to grasp this train accident, but he's followed all the way to editing and sharing. If there is justice, there will certainly be a karma with his name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to observe this lump of industrial waste - and I strongly advise against it - be sure to watch out because the whole scene was almost word for word borrowed from Bladerunner, and the AM radio as a walkie-talkie -Talkie acts. Try not to focus too much on the plot. It will only hurt more if you do this. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And that's generous.
