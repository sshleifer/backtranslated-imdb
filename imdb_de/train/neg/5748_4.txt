I have to say that I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is there. After about half an hour of boring conversation, apologize to anyone who really cares about the conspiracy, I quickly went to Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the end, I was so bored. If Gerry was not there, I've probably done one of two things: fallen asleep or turned off, but Gerry is the bright light of the movie, as he does on most of his previous films. If you're a fan of Gerry's, do not worry, he's as adorable and valuable as he always is, but if you really want to see the movie for action, good luck, because you need it, either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the Casting Director decided to include Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to spell his name!
