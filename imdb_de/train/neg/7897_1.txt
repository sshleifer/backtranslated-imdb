This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and critters hardcore. Like many of the critters / trolls / Gremlins movies of the 80s, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no punchline for this comment. It's just awful and not fun. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and in the end is as successful as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other '80s horror movies classics was that they really tried to be scary, but they were funny because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for the comedy before she started directing. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's weird to see a strange little mutant cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trench coat throwing pool balls at an outcast of the Lost Boys movie. <br /> <br /> The most annoying part of the movie is the Paul character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to start a fast-forward from the first scene to the end of the credits, which is only stopped once to see a scene in which a munchie throws pool balls at a man ... not that I did that. <br /> So the bottom line is not running to your next blockbuster and shaking hands with the manager and thanking him for not having the grapes to store this pile of rubbish on the shelves.
