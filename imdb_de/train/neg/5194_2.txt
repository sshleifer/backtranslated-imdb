Do not get me wrong, I want marijuana legalized like the next man. I will digress now. The writing was unrealistic. A PTA mother who practices drugs but is adamant about getting her drugs into the hands of a minor. Give me a break. The complacency of the very pretty Mary Louise Parker character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not likeable at all. Basically, the lines of action went nowhere. I understand the only TV country. The hypocrisy was obvious. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I should believe that ... WHY ???? I just felt that I was preached by a show that smelled of seed. It's like saying that it's OK to cheat on your wife, but with someone who is of legal age. OK, not exactly the same, but I think you understand my point. Saving the kids stuff is wonderful for campaign trails, I think, but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburban mother like the local pot dealer.
