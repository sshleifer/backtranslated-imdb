So what's the big fuss when you make an INDIANA JONES wannabe, if you have an actor cast as a fictional character from adventure storybooks and do not want to go on an adventure? Anyone writing the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for some reason, this movie lacks the excitement! This does not mean that it has no action, but look to the dark side of the picture. This bears no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure experiences with cliffhangers and close escapes. JAKE SPEED was thus promoted with clever propaganda to interest me and several others! Besides, I have never heard of this man, so who needs his attention?
