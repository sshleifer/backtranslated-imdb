It's hard to say if Noonan and Marshall are trying to monkey Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry or any other comedy team, but whoever tried to imitate them failed miserably. There is hardly a faint laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and Marshall have no chemistry at all. Marshall seems to be looking for a kind of Dean Devil May Care coolness, but he does not even come close. God knows what Noonan thought, but it was not to be funny. He seems to think that he beats a lot with his arms and legs and stares silently at everyone and everything is the height of the screen comedy; Maybe it's for him, but not for the audience. I remember seeing that in the cinemas when it came out. It was bottom of a double bill with a three-year Jeff Chandler Western (which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short ("Sappy Bullfighters" which was not) and after about 20 minutes everyone threw Children in the audience stuff on the screen. It was so incredible that it was not even the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stopped at the end (not what I wanted, but my people would not pick me up until the end of the movie), and when the mess was over, I was the only one in the theater. I saw it back on the cable about 15 years ago and looked at it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse The only thing it had to offer was Julie Newmar, who was as hot as ever; Apart from her, this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend. The two also play Japanese soldiers, and by their very nature makes Jerry Lewis' infamous game of Japanese characters, while thick lenses, buck-toothed, chewing mental defects appear benign in comparison. Marshall then ran "Hollywood Squares," and Noonan kept trying to make films, but most were almost as bad as these. Not quite, but I do not think EVERYTHING could be that bad. A really pathetic film waste. Do not waste your time with it.
