It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some of them are very weak thrillers (and I say very, very weak), others try to examine the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case, the film can not keep things together due to bad, superficial filming, bad drama and too dark, too dark cinematography. I would say Salvatores did his best in other genres and environments where he could look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, which is hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
