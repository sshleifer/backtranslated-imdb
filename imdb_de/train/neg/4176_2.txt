Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good overview of this movie? Take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires and then remove everything that is good and that's it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes after the film began, the "V-SAN troupe" (that's the dumbest acronym I've ever heard of finding a "base" that was massacred by vampires, and then they climb down (DOWN? What?) down a ladder, obviously attached to a billboard, with an obvious current pull in the background, when is this going to happen? 2210. Okay ... (wait a minute, I'll come back to that) Wow, well, there's the lesbian asian chick, the redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire / hot topic part time cashier and the shaky noob as proxy. Everyone is being played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition - it almost hurt to see Micheal Ironside in this movie - does not he get enough money as the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Just about the only original of Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> If I have this Watching aftermath of a movie, the only entertainment I got was the weak attempts of set-making. Since when does the sticking of PCI computer cards to a wall count as a ready room on a spaceship? The money needed for this film could have been used much better.
