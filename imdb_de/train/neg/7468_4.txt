The only thing that made the movie a foursome for me is probably the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's biggest performers limping incompetence. , , and yet he is one of the few anchors that prevents this from happening as a chaotic catastrophe. As Pops Romano, he offers Chris Kattan's manic stupidity a respectable mix of gangster charm and straightforward man. Prestigious appearances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as a stubborn boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling, and Fred Ward as adviser to Falk and Benedict Arnold. Actually, the plot concept has some wonderful possibilities and could have turned out to be a great comedic vehicle in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase. Kattan, who seems to worship Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, only causes a mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who are his inappropriate brothers, are both far behind their proven abilities. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are way too little and too much boring apart from each other. What I really miss is what has always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen films. There is no "second stage" when riding over the slapstick. No cultural references that only adults get. , no duplicate intent. It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And that does not mean that I recommend it for your 9-year-old, because they hopefully have a better taste and are less fascinated by their body parts and their functions.
