This film is the history of F.B.I. Dedicated to Knott's Berry Farm in the Old West. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Criminal Police Office on Crime. Hoover's heavy hand (he had a different kind?) Shows with teevee-quality script actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart on 20% of the dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chews the scenery, the movie Here you will find every c Lister, who is known in the mid-fifties, with a touch of irony or humor, from the "Amazon jungle" to the "backyard grill" - everything stinks of sound stages and back alleys. Even the shots are canned and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy was drunk every night. Apart from a few (very few) interesting outdoor shots, nothing outside of a curiosity.
