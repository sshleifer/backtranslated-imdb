Love me. Where should I start? The father is not old enough to be the girl's father. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, he suffers from the camera. The preferred exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and little and far apart. Motives are completely incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People rush to their destination with jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems normal, but this is supposed to be the final day. Breasts appear for the sake of the breast. Normally, such an approach would bring some relief, but the rest of the movie did not let me be interested in breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood turning the stomach. The general and his slogan "Shut the f ** k up!" is the only redeeming feature. For the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done the decent thing and killed themselves.
