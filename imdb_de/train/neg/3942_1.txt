Oh my god, what a horrible movie. The movie has all the right people, unfortunately it's not worth watching. I saw it for free in my local library. If I had paid for it, I would be even madder. This movie is not transferable. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow, not exciting movie? No wonder it was not distributed much, everyone involved must be ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camcorder and my big toe. It's more than boring, I really hated it. Tarintino has just lost some standing in my eyes. That must be some kind of sick joke. Do not bother with this movie. If anyone even suggests you should see it, kill it.
