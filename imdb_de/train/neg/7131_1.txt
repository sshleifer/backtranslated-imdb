I like bad movies. I like renting bad movies with my friends and putting them off while they last. Then there are horrible films like these. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a conspicuous sign that the American film industry should at least read scripts for the viewer before funding a movie crap, this movie would emerge from it. The plot is unbearable and acting is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a long time, and even they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they switch jobs to street vendors for whom they can legitimately qualify). How Angus Macfadyen was convinced to shoot this film is so far beyond me that I can not think of any analogy. I'm a loyal fan of him, but that's what made me question him. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. Several people seek revenge for a variety of reasons (and if you care enough to know who they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it becomes violence (I think). The movie is like Ouroboros, the snake swallowing its own tail. It is an endless circle of confusion and dialogue that is not suitable for human ears. This movie is essentially a big car spot for the first half and a non-decipherable action movie for the rest. It should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find a positive aspect to film, and I think it's the fact that the credits eventually roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you sang these two songs in this movie, then you're a breeze and I hope that age will leave you devastated. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you do not rent this movie in search of a ridiculous experience, listen to the great songs of Nadia Bjorlin.
