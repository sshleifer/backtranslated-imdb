Whether you want to spend nearly two hours of your life watching this depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them so goddamn that they're hysterical, look away. Jigsaw is without doubt the worst movie I have seen in my life (and I have seen 'Long Time Dead'). I say that as a fan of the low-budget horror / gore genre and after seeing some to compare it. I will not even dwell on what made this movie so bad. The only good thing is that it's so awful that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find that this is cheap, it is definitely worth it if you were involved - too bad for you. : o) IMDb has to introduce a 0/10-ranking for this movie, it deserves it.
