After watching this movie, I was genuinely disappointed - not with the actor, the story or the direction. I was disappointed with this ad. <br /> <br /> The trailers indicated that the battalion "chose the third way out". Apart from the surrender or dying (Polish information even deceived that they had the choice to be killed either by their own artillery or German guns, they even mis-translated the title as "false battalion"). This tickled the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just count corpses and count corpses, count corpses and count corpses ... Then I started to think, "Hey "This story can not be that easy ... I'll bet this clever officer will find a crafty way to save what's left of his troops." Well, he did not, they just sat and waited for something to happen. And that's how I was. <br /> <br /> The story was based on the real events of World War I, so the authors could barely use their imagination, but even thought I found this film really unchallenged and even a bit boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketing staff raised my expectations about the level this film could handle.
