Was this movie stupid? Yup. Does this movie have depth? Nope. Character development? Nope. Plot twist? Nope. This was just a movie about a fictionalized Springer show. It shows the lengths that some people need to get their cups on TV. Molly Hagan has done a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS! This movie was not so much a "breakthrough" movie, rather he was supposed to live in a caravan park (I live in a caravan park and that's not like the one in this movie) where everybody sleeps with everyone else Guys get pregnant, and all guys drive rusty '66 Ford pickups (of course, over the top), but that's the picture everyone sees when they mention "Trailer Park." Some people analyze too many movies (case study: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies only for the entertainment value; I do not want to point out that the girl in another scene wears a different shirt (read the "Goofs" bite on Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better? Sure. But it was damn funny.
