First I just want to say that I LOVE this show !!! But this episode ... this episode mocks the entire series. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they wanted to achieve with this episode, but they have successfully created the WORST episode throughout the series. <There is no action, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are crap. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "What do the animals look like" by creating the stupid "before on ..." ... is just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the authors are running out of ideas and that is a pity.
