Quirky, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these were all teasers that made me spend an hour or so discovering a movie gem. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never gets over himself. The movie is relentlessly confident. I was not even able to lift the unbelief for a moment. The exaggerated, obviously theatrical set, the exaggerated, obviously theatrical spectacle, the exaggerated, obviously theatrical direction - well, you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not have to be delivered in sledgehammer style. And for Julian Po, it's hard to feel anything because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying citizens, the idiotic clerics, the humming kids - why would anyone, especially those with the lifelong ambition, come to the coast (Slater's character), decide to stay in such a dark place?
