I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes would not have worked for Gilligan's island. If this had gone to the series, would it have been joking about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven just to recommend Adolf the kind of seating for 50? Another review compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem with that is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and that mess was just made bad and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage done by the Nazis in England and the number of people who killed them, I would think that the concept of a comedy about Hitler seems repugnant to most ordinary people We had produced a concept before each epoch we killed.
