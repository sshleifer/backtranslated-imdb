I have recently seen Belle Epoque. I thought it might be wonderful, as it won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. The predictability and simplicity of the film has challenged me a bit. Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was made, the plot of a man who fell in love with beautiful women and finally fell for the good girl was made so often. Aside from the predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film with the storyline really felt inappropriate (eg, a particular event at the wedding). At times, the film was somewhat preaching in its ideas and in terms of the Franco era, the film was staged and the church. The only thing the film aimed at was the lewd moments, the scenery, and the character of Violeta, who is a strong, independent woman in times when women were not really attached to these qualities.
