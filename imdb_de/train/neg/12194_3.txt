The movie begins with a voice that tells the audience where it is and who the characters are. And that's when I started not liking the movie. With all the endless possibilities that each director has in his hand, I find it really a very simple and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice that tells everything. I think voice-offs are a betrayal of the filmmaker concept. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear people say where we are, what date we are in, and above all, what the characters feel and think. I believe that a director must find a visual way to communicate the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the bad influential intro, a very impressive movie starts and lasts quite a long time. The life of a bourgeois family and of all individuals is presented in a realistic way. I think the director has a talent for capturing real-life situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom may seem abnormal at first glance, but life itself leads us to situations that may seem abnormal but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, realism in the movie begins to sacrifice storytelling. I really felt that I had a big headache because the characters kept talking. It was as if the actors and actresses got the theme and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's really realistic, but characters always ask "really, is that", etc., or characters say "no" or "listen to me" ten times, if only I have to say it, that's just enough I have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that practicing the game and reading book scenes is more than they should be. I understand that the piece and the book in the film are very much related to the plot, but I think the director missed the point where he should stop showing those scenes.
