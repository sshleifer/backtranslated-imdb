I considered myself quite melancholy, especially when I see great touching and cracked films. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it really surprises me to see how many people have praised this movie so much. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts in all the films: 1. Despite guilt Raven Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to save his past, I find it disturbing that the film encourages this type of suicidal thoughts. Some people think that this is a heroic action, and others think that it behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The film history is too dramatized, but the logic too simplistic. From a medical point of view, a blood group match is required to be an organ donor. Towards the end of the movie, we learned that Emily had a back blood group that limited her chance of getting the donor within a short time. Even so, it seemed Ben had the rare blood type, as well as hers, that allowed him to be her donor. Despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was not only able to donate his heart, but also his kidney, cornea, and bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only a suitable blood type but also a tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated even though the jellyfish he killed himself with was donated? <br /> <br /> I may analyze the whole story, as this is just a movie. However, some of the troubling facts described above will help you rethink your plan to watch this movie. If you decide to do a soap opera movie, you decide. But if you are looking for a smart conversation, miss it!
