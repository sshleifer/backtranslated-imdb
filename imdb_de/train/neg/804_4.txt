I rated this movie as 1 because the plot is so unbelievably incredible. Judge for yourself. Be forewarned, the following will not only betray the plot but also spoil your appetite for the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends a code through TV screens and computer monitors. When the code catches the eye in the form of light, it can access your body's electrical system. What it does is force the body's cells into the excretion of calcium. Within seconds of the infection, the patient reaches for his neck, develops a tunnel vision, his skin turns white from calcium, whereupon he falls and tears his hand and his skull in a chalk cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When he discovers that a blind computer expert is attempting to disassemble the code with a hand-held Braille output device, the device is set to a very high voltage, resulting in severe burning wounds on the expert's scalp. The virus also detects aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately, it could be stopped by dumping obsolete desktop PCs into a rack and killing the nerd with the back of a broken computer and feet in spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
