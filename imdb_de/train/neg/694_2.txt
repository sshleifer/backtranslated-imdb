It's the early 80's. There is a group of suspiciously old-looking teenagers. And there is a madman. Yes, that's Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called pranks. Why is it pranks? I do not have the slightest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a great prank is repeatedly hitting someone's dinner with a baseball bat - not a big joke on the record; indeed a pretty lousy prank when the truth is told. But let's go. <br /> <br /> The film itself is about a group of teenagers charged with cleaning a retired dorm. They become aware that a psychopath is free. To counteract this development, they part and walk around in the dark. For most, it ends in tears. <br /> <br /> pranks are a badly made Slasher movie. The DVD version I watched was Vipco's. There seems to be a lot of violence. This makes the DVD even more senseless, because a violent Slasher movie is a waste of time. Only for Slasher film and video hobbyists.
