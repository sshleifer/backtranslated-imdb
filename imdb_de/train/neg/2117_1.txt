Brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is worried, but nobody seems to find out why and how this happens and can not stop it from happening. Carry with me Bela Lugosi is responsible for taking spinal fluid from the young women to transfuse and keep their old woman alive. Stay with me. Finally, the authorities find that someone has to master the deaths and disappearances, but they can not figure out the unlikely motive. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and keep going ... If you can survive the first twenty minutes of this mess, you'll get Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disregarding one of the brides he murdered, declaring that he sleeps much more comfortably in a coffin than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror movies (the kind with budgets and conspiracies). Anyhoo - a journalist investigates the culprit (and, remarkably, the inappropriate police are nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and acting are fine. There are many well-dressed, very good-looking people in this movie. The direction is fair and the script is a bit better than the material earned. Nevertheless, this film upholds the interest of everyone except the most hardened B-movie fan. The best part ... It ends sometime, but not soon enough.
