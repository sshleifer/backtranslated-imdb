Hammerhead is a combination of crazy scientists and killer Shark movie genres. Jeffrey Combs plays the above crazy scientist, who develops a human-hammerhead-being. Strangely, this being is actually his son, whom he has turned into a monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of employees are invited to the scientist's private island. In the end, they are used as a shark bait or shark partner. For unknown reasons, the IT lead was brought as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be an imaginative, if somewhat overweight Ramboesque hero. I assume that he has learned how to deal with an assault rifle as part of his daily work in 1st Line Support. A normal day for this IT man is probably to fix someone's network connection, followed by a call to shoot the villains making the fire shoot. Or, perhaps, a call to repair a PC between physical confrontations with land-based human-shark hybrids needs to be planned? Anyway, he is incredible and saves the day. He even gets the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark man is a lame creature, but OK, I guess, judging the effects in this movie. And the movie continues at a decent pace. It's hokum, of course, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and assume that it's a complex drama about the emotional conflicts that a man experiences that turns into a land killer fish, then you're really just blaming yourself , As it is, there are rifles, gussets, girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter. It's garbage, but not as bad as some say.
