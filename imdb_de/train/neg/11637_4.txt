Uwe Boll has made the impossible possible: create a game adaptation that at least remains somewhat faithful to the game; He has turned a game full of anti-social and offensive content into a film of antisocial and offensive content. As an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we are still dealing with Uwe Boll here. So do not expect the movie to be really good. While it has its moment, "Postal" suffers very quickly from its welcome, and it becomes a pain to complain. <br /> <br /> At its core, Postal is a satire about the United States, like a twelve-year-old child. Boll seems to believe that offense is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, funnier, and the more exaggerated, the weirder. The result is a film that redefines flawlessness while being extremely fast and obvious. Yes, some gags work, but it seems to be pure luck. Highlights include the director mocking himself and people being hit hard by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include ... pretty much everything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise subsides, Postal becomes a boring business. Yes, there is every good joke and a good point ten minutes, but everything else is made up of hordes of annoying characters who shoot each other for an apparent eternity and hunt each other. <br /> <br /> That would probably work as a short film, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (though it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice attempts, but they lose themselves hopelessly in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is insulting, just for the sake of the cause 4/10
