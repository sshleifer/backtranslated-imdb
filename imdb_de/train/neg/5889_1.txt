Above all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are getting better and better. From the boring, emotional films of the 70s and 80s, the films actually contained some humor in this place. Imagine ... Actual comedies were made! The movies started to be entertaining and funny, as opposed to the long, gloomy, depressing and boring ones. In the '90s and' 00s, some really great films were made by a "new generation" of filmmakers. Movie by movie was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It became the norm! <br /> <br /> Then came United ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not once. No way. But the thing is ... we think it's funny. Because we are used to Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with such a cast with some really funny comedians. But they say nothing and do not do anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me the humor! Is it the awkward employee of Harald Eia? Is it the exaggerated ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Is it the comments of Arne Scheie? The movie is just not funny! <br /> <br /> But that's not my main role over United. That is the predictability. (And here I'm afraid that Norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since I've seen that in many other films as well.) All along, people know that things will turn out well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the film, and each one gets exactly what he deserves in the end. There is absolutely no room for surprises! <br /> <br /> All in all, I can say that after the film I was feeling bad. It was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in Norwegian filmmaking ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
