"Smithereens" is a kind of worthless film that hangs between the cable channels like a cheesy dime novel in the public library. For the mediocre director Seidelman a worthless threesome and first effort. The movie is fraught with bad acting, bad sound, poor camera work and poor quality in all areas of the movie. There are many better movies that never make it to the market, and why junk movies like this movie look and never disappear is one of life's great secrets. (D)
