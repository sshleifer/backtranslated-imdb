This movie was awful. The plot was shitty, the acting was bad, the cut was inappropriate and this movie makes me stretch out my eyes. I wish I had the time I saw this movie. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes were really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leads, it's full of clich√©s, stupid local "celebrity" cameos. The most noticed was Del as fast as I want .. "Computer idiot The worst part is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they messed up this film which contributes to a long line of lackluster efforts to establish faith in LDS in Hollywood, ie RM, Church Ball, etc., etc. I would skip this movie and instead run headlong into a wall, they will be more entertaining than this poor excuse for to watch a show.
