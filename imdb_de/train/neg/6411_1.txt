The Return is one of those films for this niche group who like movies that simultaneously bore and confuse them. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame entrepreneur who does not kill vampires or strip naked throughout the movie. I was ready to endure that, but I was not prepared to endure the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks. In the end, it turns out she crashed her car into herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. It's impossible to say with this film. Can you believe that the same guy who made the Army of Darkness made that crap? A much better idea is to stay home and see Army of Darkness on the sci-fi channel. This movie had everything: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw for one arm. The forgotten did not even have one of these things.
