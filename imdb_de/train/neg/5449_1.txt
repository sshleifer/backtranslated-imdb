The idea is that something interesting happens in the first ten minutes to addict the audience. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for a long time. When we get to a point, it's so monumentally moronic that I always thought I had misunderstood it. But I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time, who worked in different shifts and therefore did not know they were sharing. His friend asks, "But what about the weekends?" Sean has no adequate explanation. Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem, meaning that he is not sure if his girlfriend still lives at home because he works at night and she works during the day so they never see each other. This has been the case for three weeks. But his friend does not ask, "Yeah, but like I said, what about the weekends? You need to see them, it does not make sense, what is it about, Sean, are you on medication or something, but be generous and Assume that both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking to see if soap and towels have been used. (He's actually beginning to bizarrely carry the soap.) But what about the conditioner and shampoo of his girlfriend, the Sanpro and the moisturizer, the toothpaste and the toothbrush, let's go to the kitchen, what about food and drink, is there something missing, was one bought, was the bedroom made in the bedroom? or is your clothes used and swapped for clean? Is the laundry basket full? Is the seat in the toilet up or down? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> And to limit everything, Paul is dating to leave work early to see whether his girlfriend still lives at home. Why does not he simply call her? <br /> <br /> But it's getting worse. In the last act, Vincent did not tell anyone where the rest of the group was going, but he finds them. Lenny's love interest and Sean's girlfriend seem to be best friends and they also find the group. There is not the slightest attempt to explain one of these unusually unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is okay, but not nearly enough to make up for the weak characters or the annoying, lame story I heard one of the actors was interviewed and he promised "none Weapons, no drugs, no corsets ". I thought "great". But after half an hour of boredom I shouted on the screen: "I want guns, I want drugs, I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It did not take much to solve these issues. However, on the official website, the director states that the film was not scripted. That's all you need to know.
