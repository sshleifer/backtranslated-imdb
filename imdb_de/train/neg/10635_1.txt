There is a remark that one of the heroines was raped by Russian soldiers on "drunken raid", which is completely wrong. This movie should not be shown just for that reason. <br /> <br /> Also, there is a statement from someone that KGB "Jews, Gypsies, etc." prosecuted what is "worse than Nazis". KGB sought so-called "Zionist" agents who (in the view of the KGB) were imperialist agents. This is completely different from the whole of Judaism as the goal of the National Socialists. Gypsies were never prosecuted. KGB was a political instrument and was used politically, but from an internationalist perspective. The Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks of fake. The main hero speaks no Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the KGB looks generally wrong. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are totally invented, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended - this movie is full of lies and fake stuff. Instead, go to Good Shepherd.
