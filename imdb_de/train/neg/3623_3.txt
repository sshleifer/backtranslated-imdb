(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was a drive-in feature that was billed together with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production in which a series of women are murdered in a village at the same time as a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback driving behind him with his man-eating dog. <br /> <br /> The city dwellers already suspect that he is the one behind it who wants his castle to burn down. The murders began for the first time around the time when Earl Yanos' elder brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident. Then a wife Ivanna (Erna Schuer) whom Igor had hired before his death to help he shows in his experiments. Yanos agrees to engage her instead of his brother, and together they search for formulas for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life. <br /> <br /> But of course, Igor still lives (although he is terribly burned) and persecutes and kills the women in the village. We see his char-broiled face appearing in various parts of the movie, and we know he's still alive, which makes it all a bit too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor encounters another fiery end of a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on the same bed that Igor stumbles upon and hit another final char-broiled end. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD comes from a VHS source and looks pretty grainy and bad. Apart from an even scratchier trailer are no further extras included. Although it has a beautiful, scary Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it rather boring and predictable, without any fuss or mysticism. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
