Weak action, predictable violence, only half-interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?), He invented his own malformations and added disbelieving fantasies of drugs and murder to make him "hot." From the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the conflicts in the family is played poorly, clich√©d and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title was previously made - IMDb lists five films of the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, where the summary for one of the other movies is listed. It was halfway when I realized that nobody was a covert policeman. Even the other stereotype would have made it interesting if it had happened.
