Ouch! They are not much worse than this horrible adaptation of the popular novel by C.S. Lewis. While the adaptation is very faithful to the novel, the drama is just terrible and the sets and special effects are a school play. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the biggest one the BBC ever gave at the time, but they could have shrunk a little more than the $ 2 it was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know that computer effects at the time were not at the necessary or cost-efficient level, but the costume dealer in the suit looked awful. It's better to just cut the character out of the movie than the character! Avoid this at all costs.
