I loved the apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) Things just get too exhausting. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show, but it became Donald Trump's ego party. Granted, it's his company you'll work for, but come on! Some of the things say that "You're FIRED" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I do not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or something. It's just that the show is unrealistic and the way he deals with things only makes me squirm. Good entertainment? YES, but exhausting because the back stabbing is so exhausting ... it's not teamwork, it's not personal, it's just a business. Watch your rear.
