I am a current A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in class. The film obviously tends to P.O.V. There is no middle ground of "deaf perception". Also, the film has not mentioned or considered other situations that are also discussed in this topic. I.U. Deaf people who were born and later became deaf. Is it right or wrong in this case? The film is biased and practically everything in the opinion of the deaf with a capital "D". That's not bad, but for a real documentary you should try to be a bit biased.
