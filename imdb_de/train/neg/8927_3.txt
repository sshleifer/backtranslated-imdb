Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - Dead Drunk) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then she decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and teaches at a drama college run by lecherous John Huston (not asking) to teach film history and a young happy couple (the young, good-looking, handsome Roger Messrs. And Farrah Fawcett - yes, the Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal, who was not able to film and of course tried to film him. They also hired an Englishman with a decidedly anti-American stance and put all together and a set of actors with questionable "talent" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassing old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West). ... TO SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film received an X rating when it was released (it was lowered to R), mainly because of a really tasteless scene in which Welch Rusty (Roger Herren) condemns and a scene in which Welch tried having sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very annihilated ... scenes are jumping everywhere and people say and do things that do not make sense. It's not good at all, but I was never bored. <br /> <br /> Spectacle varies greatly ... Reed is terrible ... really sad. Huston chews the landscape again and again becomes a disgusting extreme. Which is not bad as Myra, but her lines make no sense, so you never know what to think of her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it is really sick to hear an almost 80-year-old woman having sex with sex jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened with ...) was very young, good looking and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what you can say ... you just look in disbelief. A movie has to be seen - to believe !!!!
