Title: Robot Jox (1990) Director: Stuart Gordon Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo Discussion: Stuart Gordon Who we usually associate with extremely bloody horror movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak Here's a little detour and made a little science fiction movie. I emphasize the word "little" as this is a very small budget and the main weakness lies in it. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (who according to this film are the United States and Russia) do not erase their differences by a well-developed world war ... but by gladiator-style battles with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles has to face the evil Russian robot hunter named Alexander. There are many cheap stop-motion animations. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is great, I suppose. The big nations are settling territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise that could be handled properly if the right budget was available. Unfortunately, a movie that could have been fun could be an embarrassment to an otherwise great director. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie as a kid and I think if you want to enjoy this movie then "I have to go back to Kids Mode to have fun." I showed this movie to some of my friends Friends, and as the movie progressed, my friends were asked, such as, "What the hell is the piece of crap?" And I'm glad that this movie is a sci-fi movie by one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon, "But when the movie broke into insane territory, I almost felt like I had to stop and not have to go through this torture because I loved that movie as a child, and there's still a little nostalgia for it, but if everyone else just would not get it, then I realized that the movie is not like that, it's really good. "First, the movie is about giant robots that move each other out of the way and to achieve it credibly . you would have to use damn good special effects for it to work - expensive effects that would help us expose the audience to unbelief, but unfortunately this is a small movie from a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after the movie) !), and the effects only help us giggle them and laugh at them. Sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half-hearted. <br /> <br /> OK If you agree that you see a mix of moderate stop animations and miniatures, you can, so to speak, indulge in the movie and even enjoy the big robots that move each other out of the way , There are certain scenes in which the robots are fighting, who are kind of cool and made me do it, "that's why I liked this movie!" But any knowledge and any, some crappy effect will lead you out of the protective little cocoon in which you tried to hide. And boom, your right to realize this movie again, does not meet his expectations. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that somehow bothered me about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. Do you know, gigantic robots throw it out? Stop the motion animation? Hello? But this film dialogue had many sexual allusions and the violence gets a bit bloody. I always wondered if this is a children's movie or not. After a while I came to the conclusion that this was basically a children's movie with an adult mind, which is really not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who are not so na√Øve as you are, feel the childlike charm of fighting two robots against each other and if you have no nostalgic connection to this movie (as I do) then I would suggest that you stay away from this movie. Gordons is a great director, but this movie he did just did not do it for me. At least not now that I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
