During the Civil War, there were many cases of shared loyalties; Obviously, many happened "In the border states," where the North by chance came across the geography of the South. From the border, the young father Owen Moore goes to the Union Army. Shortly thereafter, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, moves on the enemy property, desperate for water; He finds a supply where the unionist's young daughter, Gladys Egan, sits. As the Yankee soldiers track him down, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate hide. Later, when he returns to kill her father, the goodness of the little girl is remembered. A sweet little story by director D.W. Griffith Location Footage and humanity are shown lovingly. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (13.6.10) D.W. Griffith Henry B.
