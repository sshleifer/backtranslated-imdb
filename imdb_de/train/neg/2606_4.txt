Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who moves in with aspiring screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disturbs his life, claiming that her "doppelganger" or her evil twin wants to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror movie is hard to take seriously, even if the filmmakers and actors themselves seem very serious. Doppelganger is confused with some uncomfortably stupid dialogues. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will note that Drew's name comes from Audrey Hepburn's role in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that Newbern's name is a game named after famous author Patricia Highsmith (he actually tries Rewrite "breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I think it deserves some recognition that it's not quite your typical horror movie - I mean, writer / director Avi Nesher really seems to care about his characters and gives his movie more conspiracy than usual slasher fare. After a stupid villain explains everything In the confrontation of the audience, the film sets a hideous, external climax, which must be seen in order to be believed. This movie definitely does not save on the wound. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills her mother in this case. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore appears at the beginning only to be slaughtered by force. Drew is always very attentive and in this case very sexy. Newbern is a nice, "nice" guy. The highlight of the film, however, must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun who founded a phone business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is basically garbage, but quite amusing on a filthy, crappy plane. <br /> <br /> 4/10
