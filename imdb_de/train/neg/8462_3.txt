"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but for some reason it will be released on video 5 years later. I wonder why? Could it be: the confusing plot, the incomprehensible dialogue of Oliver Martinez and the annoying cut? It must be. I think the plot was that Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) are doing a mystical road trip. They meet a lot of crazy characters and also avoid some evil ones. The movie looks good and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. If you try to be subtle, most movies with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects will not attract attention. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is up for 2 minutes.
