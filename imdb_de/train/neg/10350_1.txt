We all know that some of the best films of all time were based on books. Although these adjustments are not very accurate, these films were still excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie ever made. Regrettably, however, I have to say that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fulfill some of Madeleine L'Engle's most basic expectations, it can also defy the standards of screenwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Mind you, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I was open-minded about this matter. I thought that a TV was made for. The movie would make up for the lack of confusion in his screenplay. After all, Ewok's Star Wars founders were decent, if a little stupid. Come to think about how the original Star Wars was made with a "budget for lunch" and see where it was George Lucas! From the first scene, however, I began to envelop the disappointment as if I had come too close to the Black Thing while chopping. <br /> <br /> In the same way, Greedo Shooting became the symbol of the 1997 Star Wars Special Edition (a catastrophic disaster in which an angry director made some hideous changes to a popular classic), Mrs. Whatsit has officially confirmed become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that it has been mutated unimaginably. Apart from the slightly controversial decision to cast Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star mentor, the filmmakers decided it would be appropriate to introduce them as Crow. Right, a crow. In addition, the heavenly Centaurion form of this very popular character was attacked by an apparently denied eight-year-old. The majestic half-winged horse has become a huge human head, with an eerie smile that clumsily stands on the bent body of a horse that happens to carry a pair of wings in the middle. If I had been five, it would have psychologically traumatized me for life. Worst of all, the fact that it was shown from behind when speaking to avoid responsibility for lip-synching meant that a scene was spent looking at the back of the head and seeing a single, immovable cheek, too render The track special effects is less credible than ET. <br /> <br /> After I've cleared out the most painful part, I have to go to the tears-awakening: the characters, the drama and the story. Personally, I'd always imagined that Meg looked a bit like Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter movies: straight hair, glasses, and a figure that most supermodels would find ridiculous. She was always a slightly worried, humorous, pessimistic mathematical genius who just could not care for Nicaragua's imports and exports. In the film she is an unpleasant know-it-all, for which I have no sympathy. In fact, I'm sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her headmaster, who has to deal with her all the time. Calvin, the friendly, intelligent child everyone thinks a jock has become a jock? The irony is terrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman, who liked to look at happy things, and replaced her with a being that is "above the sex" and likes "funny" things like girls falling off swings , The only three people I can imagine doing decent work are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit, and the red-eyed man (named "Dude With Red Eyes" for her complete reinvention). <br /> <br /> The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the film is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, who did not tell the story in the book well, but kept the only work of the original. Here, the only sole of the book is a pleasant conversation with Hades in the underworld, who is apparently unaware that his body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord supplements the sole, as well as it has shown that the truth must be felt and not seen, the flat Wookies of Ixchel (replacing the wondrous beings that hold Aunt Beast in their ranks) tear the spine. As the God of the Dead states how subtle the horror of the Earth-like Camazotz was, the torn sides of the sandstorm are scattered and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that this movie exists. I do not think the actors were really bad. It's the way the characters are written that ruin it. A Wrinkle in Time deserves to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, improved on Industrial Light and Magic by John Williams. Its sound was achieved on Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and distributed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its present state, the film is unworthy to be shown to people who respect themselves. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was good, the movie was bad and Mrs. Whatsit was ugly. <br /> <br /> Score: 0.1 / 10 (If I could) <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> You got the names right. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> It had terrible problems with the degree of customization, the script, the drama and the special effects of the Cliffs Notes, not to mention the lack of evidence, the book ever read. Oh, and on the main lid / poster is a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. It could be said that this symbolizes a high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist, who did not even bother putting on the arm of Photoshop Meg properly.
