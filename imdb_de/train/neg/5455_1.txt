I saw this piece at a CA film festival. My God, what was the director thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study of what you should NOT do when shooting a short film. First of all, this project makes absolutely no sense. Part of the movie is in "The Waystation", a stupid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is more than bad. Actually so bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. Leading actress Julia Reading is a stage short of acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the boys Jacob and Fenner played, but it's as if the director has no idea how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than acting was the dialogue that bordered on absurdity. The author (who I assume is also the director) writes each character as if he's auditioning for a comic villain. <br /> <br /> The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest with a movie that is so bad it's easy to miss. The production design is pretty good, although the Waystation looks like a normal bar. The costumes and make-up are fine and I understand that the production worked on a low budget. It's only when the characters speak or they try to push the conspiracy, the movie gets crap in a dirt. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is awful. It's as if the director / writer saw a lot of sci-fi movies and put all the pieces he liked into a blender and made that happen. My only hope is that he used other people's money for that, because when he uses his own, he's a total jerk.
