What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible requirement and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses it. Actually, it never really started. There was a little excitement when we found out that Angie was not really pregnant and then found out she was, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually puts a lot into a movie, was awful and his entire character was not even close enough for this movie except to make it longer. I really would have loved to see more interactions between the main characters Kate and Angie, and maybe not for a mere comedy, which unfortunately was not, but a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie had done that, it could have been very funny because both actresses are pretty funny in their own way.
