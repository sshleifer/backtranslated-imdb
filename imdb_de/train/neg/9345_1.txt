I feel like I've been had, the cheater is on, do not fall for it. After reading glowing reviews (the director was a Sky film critic for years, so he has many colleagues in the press who wanted to do him a favor by writing favorable reviews), I expected solid drama, atmosphere, excitement, strong Characterization, a fascinating plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" does not honor the critics' promises and sacrifices these traits instead of kitschy low-budget special effects (which this cliched Cobweb scene was for?), Unrealist choreography, and rash, dull stories, stereotypes, and camera angles. <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' interestingly starts with some nice locations in Scotland, but from here it goes straight downhill. Instead of spending time creating atmosphere, creating characters that might interest us, or creating tension, the director decides to drive you crazy with selfish, melancholy Twaddle voice overs. The main characters are so unsympathetic and played so badly - the audience does not care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make things even worse, the "tributes" (typical of a director trying to pay his fees to former masters) are either completely stereotyped or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that kept me in the cinema and kept me in the cinema, but even that could not support the dramatic narration that combined some time with the action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the movie became increasingly flawed and to be honest, annoying. I still looked at the whole damned thing! <br /> <br /> I guess I liked the attempt of bitter realism in the movie, but even that was destroyed when they were often cut with weird and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. You do not need a huge budget to shoot really moving movie. So much was said, how little money they had to make for this film, half a million is not a bit of money ... SO NO EQUIPMENT! Sometimes I wonder what the actors think ... Or their agents have thought! <br /> <br /> Pass on this turkey if you are not masochistic or mindless ... NOT MY THINGS <br /> <br /> 1,5 / 10
