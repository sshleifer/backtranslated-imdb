Yes. I was pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it came to the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled storyline glittered in the Hollywood style and borrowed scripts from better films that make music in the music. <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More make-up, fancy costumes and choreography = more money for the questionably "talented" Beyonce draw. <br /> <br /> If you're like stepping back, you should appreciate the real groups that were struggling (without digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage.
