I have read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can not say that I have recommended a lot. The Leonard Cohen soundtrack is not only overly cumbersome, but also unbearable. The movie looks authentic, but something has to happen to make it work, and nothing does much: a fleeting conspiracy (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematic. It just goes there. As flawed as it is, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has a few moments of real wonderment and is a movie that I would rather review. For a glittering rethink of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" "McCabe" is far superior.
