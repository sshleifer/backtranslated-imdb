They had such a potential for this movie and they are completely out of the woods. In the first Cruel Intentions we ask ourselves what motivated the main characters to become who they are and how they act. There is almost no character development in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story, but this movie did not do anything for me. It was as if they were skipping good writing instead of unnecessary F-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. The writing was just awful. Another thing that bothered me was that they used the EXACT SAME lines of the original on lease 3. Like "down boy" or the kissing scene and a few others that I can not remember. I was not at all impressed by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job. That's about the only thing that has brought this film in line.
