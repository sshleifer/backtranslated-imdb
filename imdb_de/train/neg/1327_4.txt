In this horrible movie, all the Asian stereotypes you can imagine will be put together in a hideous package. Greedy, devious Japanese businessmen are sending the stupid but lovable police officer Pat Morita the secrets of Detroit's industry. Here he meets a descent Jay Leno, who immediately names a murder victim as Jap and Morita Tojo calls. From there everything goes downhill.
