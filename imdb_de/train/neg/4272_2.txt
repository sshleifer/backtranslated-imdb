These kinds of films in which a psycho of one kind or another tries to damage the reputation of a naive person (and eventually eliminate it altogether) in order to take over his life. Deadly magnetism, Pacific Heights, the hand that cradles the cradle, single white women, and a thousand television movies made for television are just a few examples. But while some, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, could offer at least some extremely paranoid, exciting characters or a few plot changes, Unlawful Entry plays everything according to the book. And if it were not for the prominence of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would become more mediocre than a miniseries by Danielle Steele. Russell plays Michael Carr, a perennial naïve guy who seeks the help of an officer couple when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly lets go of his rage at the fake policeman (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain so helpless in the situation. The policeman first makes friends with Carr (probably just as if he would do so). But soon the cops want to get rid of Carr and destroy the boys' lives as much as possible (which is pretty easy if you're a cop and if you're the policeman who has the guy's security system installed his house), to take over and probably get his wife. It seems less end-oriented and more likely than the police officer to prove his power. In other words, the woman is more a trophy than an end. And the story is based entirely on the book. You can probably predict every incident before it appears on the screen, if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment on, our naïve protagonist realizes that he's a victim of credit card fraud (committed by a psychopathic villain), right up to the turn-around finale that he's not really dead.
