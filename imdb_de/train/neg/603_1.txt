Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly researched that it is ridiculous. Nobody could be terrorized on the London Underground. In the short time it is not in operation every night, there are maintenance crew teams controlling the tracks and carrying out repairs, etc. That homeless people live there is equally unlikely. Or that it's even possible to get locked up and have no access to a mobile phone at the present time ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that could happen if someone is there after the last train is graffiti can be sprayed on it. Although this is under control due to the enormous number of security cameras in the network, this is another thorn in the eye of history. (Remember that we have more security cameras in London than in any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If she were in a city I do not know, I might have loved her out of ignorance but it is not a high quality movie, so I just could not bring myself to expose my unbelief and enjoy it for the banal little story it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating exists! Maybe the most disappointing movie I thought I would like.
