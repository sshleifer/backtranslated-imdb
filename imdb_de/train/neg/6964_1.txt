Usually, I watch the MTV movie awards to see a fun, entertaining show that delivers a unique award (Chewbacca, for example, wins a lifetime prize). So this year was no different. Although I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny and silly to me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American pie movies and even enjoyed him in Dude Where's My Car. But the MTV movie awards were just awful. Nothing was koherent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stay singing and dancing; He certainly can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious who the authors were for this show. Last year's appearance of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (just the parody of Lord of the Rings was worth watching the entire show), but this year was totally different. Did anybody understand Timberlake's comments on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They stare together into a movie, but have never met, here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just went into their lame dialogue, without referring to the "joke" of Timberlake. And Seann was completely wasted as a talent and made me not only smile, but also laugh alone. And what was the point of Harrison Ford's liners? Did they make any sense for someone? Perhaps the MTV authors thought the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the president of Air Force One. I'm at a loss And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old is he? The guy looks 30 and tries to act 19 again ... give up, show some class (as in your best actor academy) and play your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for best visual performance. That was very creative, very well done and the only real laugh of the whole evening.
