Okay, when I came to the blackboard for this movie, I really expected people to make fun of it. I was surprised to see that it pleased people over 7 years. I enjoyed the movie ... but only b / c made fun of me and my little sister (who is only 10 years old) about the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jordan, but this acting was terrible. They know that a movie goes to the bathroom when the leash can not work. And it did not even have a good script or a good plan to redeem it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very lame ... marginally pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even though that's said, I thought there were some good actors, like the beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I just can not overcome: <br /> <br /> 1.) That this Spencer guy falls in love with her. Okay, eww. I looked up the data and although he's only about four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed to be much bigger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF she seemed to be 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed to be a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) That Kristi Yamaguchi would somehow come to skate for one girl only. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it seemed unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have scholarships for skating, or that a school would hire a skating coach with such connections All that was said ... it was not the worst movie ever known, but it was not very good even for DCOM standards, which I think is pretty low.
