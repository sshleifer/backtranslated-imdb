Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing the script in 1991 at the age of 21. <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this bitch, she is ready to be named the happiest person ever. This movie is not an end. It always surprises me how it will turn into movies ... and the fact that you let this writer for a bit expose? Serious? I can write better crap in my sleep than that. <br /> <br /> OK, so how many lines do I have to enter? I do not understand that at all. I think I'm a freshman. I do not understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have a sentence with a word. or even an answer in a word I mean, come on? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... is that enough? <br /> <br /> This movie is worthless.
