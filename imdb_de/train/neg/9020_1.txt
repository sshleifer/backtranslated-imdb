I accidentally stayed awake last night watching this thing. The only thing I could say well about this horrible movie is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No real character development, wait, I'm not even sure if they were characters. Setups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted because sometimes they could not even be synced with alternate settings. If I could evaluate this with zero or minus, I would do that. Unfortunately, it is not even worth the time for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time even thinking about it.
