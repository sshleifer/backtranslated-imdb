The shame! There I sat comfortably in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, hoping for another wonderful Muppet night of entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets of the sublime Christmas story go along with it? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that says something) and the conspiracy was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they blew too much at Treasure Island. A short story, such as Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high-winks around it. Where are the Muppets going next? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
