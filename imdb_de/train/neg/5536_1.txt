The uprising of zombies has no redemptive functions. I'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad and that the 1936 impact must have had more punch. I guess that's not true: it's not as if the IQs have risen sharply over the past seven decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored with this garbage as the average viewer today. Why? Just look at the first few scenes and count the breaks between events, the dreadful choice of when to slice close, the slapdash editing, which seems to take two extra seconds for each shot to make up for the runtime. Watch out for the superfluous dialogue: "I'll make tea, go out / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes I am." This type of exchange happens several times. Normally, I would love to be a GIANT fan of bad movies, but watch the listless and boring lines mumble to the listless and boring lines, and every desire to laugh at the movie fades away. This kind of uninteresting waste of time is far worse than energetic, resourceful thinkers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus conquering the Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than the more interesting films have a backward vision of entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs in astonishment: it's bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly closing in on boredom. Which one is much worse.
