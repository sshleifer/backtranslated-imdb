Sorry, but apart from the fact that Kim Basinger did a good job, he was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a long time. The logic is thrown out when 4 young men terrorize this woman in front of a crowded mall and then shoot a security guard. But nobody seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or running back to the mall, she sets off and lands with the boys on the hunt for the forest in the middle of the forest. I can not even describe how stupid it is to flee this woman in front of four remaining thugs, to have a red toolbox, that God should scream, help her, and then have sex with one of them after brutally brutalizing the others have killed. Please trust me, that is bad and also a bit tasteless.
