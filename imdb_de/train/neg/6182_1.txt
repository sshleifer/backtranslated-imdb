This movie makes Peter an elf in a Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not a Robin Hood costume, ignoring all the persona features in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor Captain Hook is a total clown. And since, of course, every Disney cartoon must have a character with too many hits in mind, they've made one of the Lost Boys into one. The only character not disgraced in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself? The sweet parents do not even have the time to realize that their children have left !!! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and they ruined it! The famous children's day scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is also a breathtaking piece. There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It's a wonder he even lost his shadow, and she helped him hold him. (Even if his shoes and it makes no sense to me.) <br /> <br /> A great story like ruining this just to amuse kids should be illegal. So, now know if you did not know it yet - this Disney version has nothing in common with the original story - which is not really a kids story, just a great, great story that just annoys me to no end.
