It is so sad. Although this movie was shot with a movie, it stinks a bit more than a movie like Blood Lake. The music they play is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I like the brother and the sister in this movie. They both do not try to sound very sarcastic when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what does the killer have at the beginning with his mask? That has stayed behind! I practically ignored the second half. My favorite part in this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. The same exact sound for every chop!
