I read the whole book "A Fold in Time" and then watched the movie. The movie contained all the elements of the book, but since the book was 190 pages long and the movie lasted 2 hours, he felt crammed with too many effects and bad acting. The girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin have to band together to become Meg's father to find and leave the island Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really a stinker. The spectacle is terrible, the direction is ridiculous and so far the situations are not necessary. I was really shaken to see the same person as Madeleine Engle, who wrote the book and made the film, made a great book and a horrible movie. Acting is worse than any direct video recording. Yes, I have to admit that there were cool effects. But seriously, they were all made terrible and in no way serial. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the movie. I wish I could give a 0, but unfortunately I can only give it a 1. One half could have been useful.
