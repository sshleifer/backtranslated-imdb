I thought the movie was a bad documentary. Nothing substantial was discussed. It seemed to cheapen the ideas and provided nothing new. The film lacked miracles or romance, or something that would really make you a scientist. Most scientists were "stereotypical" and sometimes funny. One woman said that her awards were not crucial, only to children who were helped. She said that after a 10-minute scene in which she explained all her awards. "Humble scientist" to play, right? "I have equations in my head," said another. I do not see how that explains us. It has not covered the significant impact of science on our culture. The science policy was barely touched. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie for 10-14 year olds. Otherwise it was boring and enlightening. <br /> <br /> 4/10
