Yes, I've eaten the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was freezing cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses, but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I've given The Darkling 4 out of 10 possible stars - I've seen worse movies, but this one is definitely right there in the old garbage can of bad movie - poor script, bad acting, bad light, and kitschy special effects , <br /> <br /> The action that never makes any sense is about this simple little family, daddy, mommy and little girl - that's what I'm talking about Spectators should "identify", all three were boring and annoying. They just want the dark side to get each of them. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a cook whose hobbies are cars. Daddy meets a rich man called Rubin, who collects cars and also owns a creature he bought in the "mysterious" Orient. Rubin holds it in a birdcage and calls it "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, the darkling is referred to as three or four different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the devil. So choose which of these explanations suits you - because you trust me, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the Darkling seems to be that he longs for a companion - it gets a human companion - and is eventually dissatisfied with the human. Of course, this leads to an immense wealth, followed by a catastrophe, for the person who has teamed up with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it only leads to a very long, boring movie. <br /> <br />
