I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain of Power Rangers. and has about the same area of ​​rubbery movement. This might be fine if the manufacturers were not as proud of the design as it seems. In other words, for a man in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror movie that could benefit from a puzzle, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. Granted, it's usually shaky and unpredictable. I suppose you should assume that it is so scary that even the cameraman is freaked out. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person being eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person being eaten, only now they are screaming and are poor. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costumes are bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are below average, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely by accident, so that more people can be eaten or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely have more explosions = a better way of thinking. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a huge explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode so much that the crazy shark even explodes in the end. <br /> <br /> Talking about: I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it's hard to believe that anyone would think if he was trying to sex with a huge half-shark person with a woman to turn freaky shark people into babies is a good idea. That is, unless that person is the crazy scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its malice is not really enough to keep a long interest of the person. MST3K may be a good thing to do with your friends, but if you catch this bad boy, do a favor and switch channels.
