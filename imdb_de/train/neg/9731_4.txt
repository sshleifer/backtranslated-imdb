Others have already commented on the "demise" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly able to select good projects (as he had shown in "Exorcist III" the same year), which is why he agreed to appear in this film. Sure, he gives a corresponding denied performance and the movie is not absolutely bad; It's just inexhaustible, uninteresting and unsightly. That's three "Un" too many. (* 1/2)
