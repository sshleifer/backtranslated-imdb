When I finally got the chance to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on a Region 2 imported DVD, I was amazed at how entertaining this zombie epic is. The transfer is just spotless and as good as never I'll see if not Anchor Bay finds out about it. The Gore really stands out as it should, and you can really appreciate the superb make-up and Gore fx. The sound is also terrific. It's just a 2-channel Dolby, but if you have a receiver in Dolby Prologic 2 you can really appreciate the cheesy music (actually a very good result) and the effective, if cheap, sound effects. It never sounded so good and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flowed in this movie, it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots, exploding puss mega pimples, a cleaver on a zombie's neck, and a woman's extremities burned), intestinal chewing, zombie babies and much more lost track. <br /> <br /> This is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans, especially the Italian kind. There are some excellent set pieces and cinematographs that I can find. If you see a clean trigger and no vile pirate copies, this is a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie never lasts for a second, and I find it unstable. The synchronization is terrible. Acting is stiff and the feeling of disrespect is celebrated in a great way, but that is part of their charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, filming so badly, so well, on purpose. It is a random genius of the highest order. If they made it laugh, it would have been a disaster, but they just played it as an arrow, and the result is a terrific cult classic that keeps its fingers crossed for all the traditional film standards. <br /> <br /> Tons of action sequences, exotic locations, excellent set design, good, sometimes gripping In the cinematography gorgeous cheesy drama and erratic, yet interesting storyline, great makeup effects, beautiful women in can kick your butt, excellent music and sometimes funny, sometimes scary, but always entertaining zombies. How can you do anything wrong with this film has it all, a cult classic that outlasts time.
