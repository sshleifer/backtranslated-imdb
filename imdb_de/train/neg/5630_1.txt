The only reason I watched the movie until the end was the "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is really bad and the girl's performance is really, really bad. Honestly, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but you just have to have common sense to notice that this work is unbelievably bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind when she started talking was, "She's having an affair with Willem Dafoe and he's agreed to help her with the script and appear in her movie, because she is the brilliant director ". Surprise, surprise, the next day, after watching the movie, I found out on the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Terrible story and terrible performance.
