2 out of 10 possible stars - and that's too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could that go miss I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drug Sam Shepard was on the weekend when he got this piece of dribbling out. I had long suspected Sam of being a little crazy. This movie, based on his game, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of Arty B.S. These actors love to dip their teeth as they give them the chance to confess endlessly. For the viewer moving through this nonsense rubbish, there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie. <br /> <br /> You did not see dysfunctional families until you saw this group. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yes, crazy. They also have mouths with these words that make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter. In addition to the above, as if that was not enough, the plot - and it's so skinny you could read it exactly - has a hole the size of Alaska. Ma is conspiring to sell her rundown farm. As it turns out, it's also Pa. Now, I do not pretend to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, the property owned by the owners must have both signatures to be sold. If only one of them owns the property, the other one can not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and so his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else really worked. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason why someone could If you want to watch this movie, be sure to see James Woods in frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone would want it.
