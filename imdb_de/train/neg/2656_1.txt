(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to see this tonight. I had to turn it off before the second lesson, because I found absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both seemed to have little regard for others as selfish, and the daughter was also rude, irreverent, and ruthless contributed to the mix. When the daughter died, all I thought was, "At least we do not have to watch her anymore." Keaton did a good job of getting into her dumbfounded state and mourning, but until then things had gone too far for me. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped looking. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you have to take care of the characters much earlier - if it takes almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The support The cast was sincere and well played - I felt for * her! * and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even together that was not enough to wear the movie for me.
