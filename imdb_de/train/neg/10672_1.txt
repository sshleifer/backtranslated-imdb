It had all the clich√©s of films of this type and no substance. The action went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a jerk for watching. The production was good; Screenplay and drama, however, were B-movie quality. The casting was bad because good actors mingled with frizzy actors. The good actors did not assert themselves and the others did not raise. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it anymore, but I'll say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play cartoons in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for mindless entertainment, I would not recommend this movie anyway.
