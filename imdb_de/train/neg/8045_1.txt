I'm so confused. What was this movie about? What was the motivation of the murderer? He seemed pretty angry, but I have not figured out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had no depth. Or less than zero deep. What I think would make it a hill. Or a bunch. From crap. The acting was terrible. When I was looking for some actors in this movie, they were in very few things that I had heard of, and that was no wonder. I can not decide if I have to hurt them because they are embarrassed to be so bad in a movie, or if I think they should never be offered an acting job again. Starting. , , NOW! (Seinfeld reference) Really, do not waste your time doing that. There is so little substance that there is nothing that you can only make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst Slasher films - NO, one of the worst films of ALL ART I've ever had, and I've seen quite a few.
