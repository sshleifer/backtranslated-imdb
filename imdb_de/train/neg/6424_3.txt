A bankrupt would be a scriptwriter and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) would be forced to live in a self-storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they believe is the serial killer holding the Terrorists terrorize City, the "Costume Killer" (so-called because he injects his victims with Windex and dresses them in stupid costumes). They convince him that his life story will make a great movie and bring together a group of inappropriate wannabe filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of filmmaking can be murder. <br /> <br /> There's more to this film, but unfortunately it was left in the cut room and shows (rumor is that the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all have good jobs and are better), since this is the basis for an extraordinary black comedy, but only moderately cute. <br /> <br /> If you're a Ron Perlman fan, it's absolutely worth the effort. His comedy timing is excellent and he has a chance to make some really great impressions (he was not joking when he said in the commentary on the Hellboy movie he needed an intervention when he came into Jerry Lewis mode). It's just fun to see in this movie. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-lane (but central) role.
