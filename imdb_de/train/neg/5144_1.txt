The orange tone to everything was just good. Oh yes, the main character lives in a ghetto that's all orange with orange-tinted people. To mentally escape this bitter poverty of the body, she plays a video game that is completely immersive (which tends to make no rules clear and no logic follows the gameplay). She apparently earns an income by playing the game, but she does not appear to be an employee of the game company. Many unspoken breaks later, the story continues slowly. It uses a glitchy orange computer interface with a user interface that is visually annoying, and I can only assume a future version of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I'm basically asking the viewer why she's wasting her precious time doing a moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life? Oh yes, playing games is fun, but what is the point of starvation? While playing for a lifetime, she plays a lousy, even more orange, lame video game in which to immerse herself. Your dog runs away (probably looking for an owner who attracts attention for at least a moment and feeds it regularly) or is stolen by the woman (while ignoring her lousy orange reality). <br /> <br /> Now she is obsessed with a game that her gameplaying team has lost the entire uninteresting movie. Yawning. So she wants to be the best of the best, get her Ash Catchem (bore us all). Golly, this main character also sucks as a human and has no redeeming qualities other than her physical beauty (which she could trade for a way to escape her bitter poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "real" level and at least it's not terrible, and she's sent to kill a former comradely teammate who is mentally living on the "real" level. After all, the boring, boring, boring, orange movie is no longer a tedious task to look at but has the potential to say something in the direction of "The main character is trapped in an imaginary computer-generated poverty and she is now in the real world. " , Maybe she will accomplish the murder and now live in the real world? Well, she kills the guy and he disappears into a digital effect. Impressive! Thanks idiotic director. You suck, you suck so much, director. <br /> <br /> Here the director had a chance to redeem himself a little by burying this lame, crazy, gruesome movie with a philosophical twist. The director could have said: "The REAL WORLD is here and if you live in it and help make it better, it will not be a scary, orange country of poverty. " A clever way to turn this damned film into a torturously slow lesson on bourgeois pride (for the 1% of viewers who have not found anything really entertaining or filming as a soloist) <br /> No, director. The director had to screw it all up by putting in some ghoulish digital effect and destroying any chances of salvation for this dreadfully lousy movie, wasting a lot of money, wasting time, and losing the viewer's confidence. <br /> <br /> Then it ends. Good riddance. I hope the director chokes on it. I put this HACK on my "avoid at all costs" list for all other movies associated with his name.
