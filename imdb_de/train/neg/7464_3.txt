I have not seen the whole movie. I could not see the entire movie. I stopped the DVD after watching it for half an hour, and I suggest everyone who thinks of stopping themselves before taking the CD out of the suitcase thinks. <br /> <br /> I like mafia films both tragic and weird, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is just trying too hard to make the audience laugh, the action seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky). from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overdone and lacks subtlety or credibility - all his strange behaviors seem elaborate - Chris Kattan is "acting" instead of taking on a role - he beats you out of the story. Every scene is absolutely predictable, the "comedic event" that will occur on the set is evident as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies like Mr. Bean, the catastrophes caused by the title character are funny because you can empathize with the motivations and initial event of the characters, and the situation where the character ends is not telegraphed. Corky, however, feels he purposely makes a desperate attempt to make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> If Chris had not played such an extraterrestrial character (who never really gets in touch with the other characters) the movie) and its behavior is completely inexplicable (apart from trying to draw laughter) and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotypical - all the jokes seemed too familiar - this movie could have been seen. But is not it? Do not look at it.
