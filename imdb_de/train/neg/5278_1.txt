If a comedy movie has its wonderful soundtrack on the back, you know you're not using a top-notch movie. I rented this movie with friends who would expect a giggle, but overall, to get most of our laughs that make fun of the movie. We could not have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been okay with a few changes. At first the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly performed and placed. The big boy in the movie got us killed, blessing him for trying the scene, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If he had been pulled out of the movie, everything would have been bearable. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when the group of boys stole one of the parents' porn films and it turned out to be gay porn. But to best summarize the comedy, I'll just tell the opening gag for the fat kid. He wears a puke-stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film editor could have saved the film by removing the fat kid and removing it from the movie for 20 minutes, school scenes and an ending that's been over thirty seconds of random quarrels. Oh, BTW, there are two good elements the movie has. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and makes his jokes so that nobody is missed or underestimated. The other redeeming element of the film is the gorgeous Ms. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored by most films, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time even if you rent this movie. It did not appeal to me and I was part of the target group (18 men).
