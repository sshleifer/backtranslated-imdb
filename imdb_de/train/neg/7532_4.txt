What I really love about the short films of this woman was the elusiveness of the topic - especially in "Living With Happiness". This film has some nice beginnings - unusual filming locations and the potential for a curious cinematic treatment, but it does not succeed with rickety exposure dialogues, irregular performances and very TV coverage of ordinary cinema. The ideas are so pronounced that they almost feel like a TV commercial. But the mood is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see this director doing a full-length animation and working with a producer who is not so boring about clarity.
