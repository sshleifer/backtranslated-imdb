How does a Scot in a tartan love to eat in bonny lilac heather? Very, very carefully. Well, I have the distinct advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Many Americans take this simple nonsense seriously. as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has an accent that the production of the "Brigadoon" of the Wells - Next - the - Sea Amateur Dramatic Society would be rejected. Liam Neeson, apparently popular with the ladies, wears his sash with the authority of a man whose Great Grandmama once got off the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld enemy? Where would the Scots be without hate and responsibility for everything? "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy by comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
