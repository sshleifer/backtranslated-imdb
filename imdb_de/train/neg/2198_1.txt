A scientist and his girlfriend are on their way as his speed leads to a car accident. He escapes unhurt, but she is beheaded. He saves her head, brings him to his house and keeps him alive (!!!!). Then he looks for models and strippers to find the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches over his head, which starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection to a deformed monster in the closet ... <br /> <br /> As you can see, that's pretty stupid stuff. but I had a certain preference for it. When I grew up in the late 70's, a local television station showed this movie about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed it on TV on Saturday afternoon - uncut. Watching it on TV was great! Explicit blood and blood, along with a cruel monster and a seedy sexploitation - who cares if it was good? When I see it now, I realize how bad it really is. <br /> <br /> The drama is totally miserable, production values ​​are not there, the script is pretty stupid and (besides the still rather nasty Gore) this is stupid stuff. There is also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly big monster at the end. Also add an end that leaves many loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. On the other side of the garbage. In any case, it's not a good movie, but a must (for a time) only for horror and Gore fans. <br /> <br /> The laugh of the head is also pretty scary. Note the end credits, which mislead the title ("The head that would not die")!
