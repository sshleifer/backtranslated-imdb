A really horrible movie. I did not initially know that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon I realized that all the characters were talking with barely disguised kiwi accents among the fake American accents. Why did it have to be fixed in America? - It could have been set in New Zealand and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear the terrible attempts to speak with American accents. A bad bad movie. I am surprised that it took so long - how did it out of the box? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at an action movie by Segal / Willis. A total waste of money! If TAXPAYER money were in this garbage, I would lead a revolution to bring all the money back into the treasury. I still found the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why did I keep looking? Well, I am a film fanatic and can not help myself!
