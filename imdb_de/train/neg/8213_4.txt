I can not believe it, IMDb really has every TV program you know! I have not seen this show for over 20 years. I can only remember two episodes, and I can barely remember it. I remember Tony might not have been there from the start because one of the episodes I remember is where everyone tries to get Tony to, but he rejects them, but usually he'll end up the show member Power House, with whom everyone cheers. <br /> <br /> The other one I remember is the one where Lolo seems to be dead for some reason (complete with funeral and mourners). I can not remember why he is dead or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows where I convinced myself that I could only dream it because no one else had heard of it.
