The problem with these types of films is that literally dozens of them are produced each year. Fortunately, only a handful receive a theatrical version, while the others are driven directly to video or TV like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film is its originality. It's one of those movies that uses the "Die Hard" formula, with which a tough but restless guy is in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, it is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security practices for businesses and individuals. In this case, he is sent to a cruise ship, which is of course kidnapped. You can see this movie as a mix of "The Hard" and "Air Force One," and the movie does not even hide the fact that these two movies were probably the biggest source of inspiration. Really, you can not view this movie as original at all. It uses all the clich√©s from the book and this movie really does not provide any surprises or anything remotely resembling an original. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a movie like this, it has a very weak script. Or rather, it is written a bit lazy. As I said earlier, the film does not contain anything original, but even the actual story itself has some elements that are far from likely and that are just ridiculous. I mean, kidnapping a huge cruise ship with just eight guys, half of them carrying just a few small guns and then asking for a "just" $ 10 million ransom, it's already for a ship worth about ten times that pretty ridiculous. How do you even want to divide the money afterwards? Everyone gets just over a million or something? This is hardly profitable for such a large and risky company. And then there is the case that the passengers are taken hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the passengers on the huge ship hostage, and they manage to place them with his gun in a room he just can not hold with just one man. However, you never see more than 30 hostages as if they were all onboard. Even if the van diene character is looking for his son and vice versa, no matter in which room they pass the huge cruise ship, they always collide immediately. Just a few examples of lazy writing within the film. <br /> <br /> But of course it's an action movie, so of course the story becomes secondary. On the other hand, it's not as if this movie is going to do any good action. Half of the actors look like they've never had a gun in their hands, and the movie is full of slow motion. In some places it gets really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie does not include the best actors, though I have to say that Casper Van Dien is not a bad action hero and actor when it comes to genre and B-movie shots. However, he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; No matter how old he is, he just does not look convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien once started out as a promising young actor, but playing in films like this does not really help his career. He is probably capable of something better, though he never has the right opportunity to show it. All other actors also do a fair job, but their characters are just so formulaic that they never really get interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the worst genre movie I've ever seen, but it's all. It's also not the most original or memorable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
