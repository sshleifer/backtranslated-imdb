This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a clone on Friday, the 13th (1980). The poster for this film makes it look like there's a kind of cross between Jason and Freddy, which probably attracts viewers. There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad to think that some people on Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) stumble on video or DVD and waste their time with this sad, cynical, depressing movie. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills who hopes the other campers will be as nice as she is and that they will have no trouble. Meanwhile, the other campers recognize that people are gradually disappearing, Angela being the excuse for having to send her home. Could Angela be the killer who was once a man and had undergone a sex reassignment surgery years ago? Who knows? Who cares? <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, there were a lot of movies in which the genres Mad Slasher and Dead meet teenagers. Some have a plot, others not, but they are all as bad as this one. Sleepaway Camp II: Unfortunate Campers consists of 80 minutes in which youths are presented and then stabbed, strangled, impaled, chopped, burned alive and mutilated. That's all in this movie. It's just mindless, bloody violence. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I remembered the movies on Friday, the 13th, which stated to viewers that the primary function of teens is to be hacked to death. The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed. Imagine the sick message this movie offers to its teens: "The world is a totally bad place," the movie says, "and it'll kill you, it does not matter what your dreams or hopes are Whether you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend, no matter what you think, what you are doing or what your plans are for the future, you can forget those plans because you're just going to wind up dead. "<br /> <br / > And the worst thing is - and by not giving too much away - the movie just makes room for a sequel. Well, why not? You've probably already brought the bucket by shooting three or four of these films. I missed the original Sleepaway Camp (1983), and after seeing its first sequel I hope to stay away from the other sequels as well as the original. And for parents, if you know children who really like this movie, do not let them go out with your kids.
