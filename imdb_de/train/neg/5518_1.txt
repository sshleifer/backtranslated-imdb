I have not seen this and I do not intend to see this movie or any other film that includes Lindsay recently arrested in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anybody who has visited ANY from Lindsey's most recent films. I can well imagine that 2007 will be the high water mark in her film career until she cleans up her appearance. Recent advertising has only hindered her career as a filmmaker if she has other goals to produce more films. Now, Lindsay will probably have to audition and actually fight for ANY role. Her reputation is currently "poison" and could well have a negative impact on box office sales in every movie she's in. <br /> <br /> Sooooo ... now Lindsay has to "not want to be" ..... will she be able to handle it? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno wants to have Lindsay back in his TV show? <br /> <br /> The above is just my OPINION. I have no insider information.
