Dreadful! Absolutely terrible! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera and then the whole crew went for lunch. Every day. I try to give this video away, but no one will take it. I give him a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I have to keep my fingers crossed. <br /> <br />
