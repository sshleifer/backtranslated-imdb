The first thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It is not nudity or anything else, but much that was not necessary. Annik Borel plays a distraught woman who believes ghost stories to her family, her ancestor, who resembles her uncanny, was a werewolf and believes that her fate will be the same. What I actually found very interesting. The original wolf man was supposed to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw the right wolf man you should never see for an extra dollar or two. I find this concept that someone is not really a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that she's not a werewolf right from the start. Therefore, there is no thrill or attempt to make the movie look as if it really happened. They also fail there and add one or two parts of the film that relate to this reality. At first I was thrilled when I read the description of the film. But slowly I realized that this is a cover, just so they can show the breasts of the main characters as often as possible. Annik Borel is either a decent actor who plays a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor who plays a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no mind and is just a nut who runs around like a wolf mad and growling, it takes little skill to play. She has moments when her performance breaks for a scary moment, but is quickly ruined by the bad camera work and the bad light. The idea is great, but ugly throughout the movie. 3.10
