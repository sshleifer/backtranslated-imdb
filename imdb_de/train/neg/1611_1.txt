I think that's a terribly produced and directed. Benicio Del Toro should not work in film production, he should set accents, and that's it. Steven Soderbergh has missed the idea of ​​revolution, the ideals and the most important things about the life of Che Guevara and so on. The camera is awful, as if someone with a two-day work experience was taking pictures of it, music is ... I do not know ... is there music in the movie? I will not recommend this piece to anyone. It just wastes 4 hours watching TV or whatever ... I can not figure out how anyone can rate this movie with more than 3 stars. DESASTER ... DESASTER ... DESASTER ... DESASTER Please do not pay attention. Save yourself from the misery of the "film"
