This movie has lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was as if someone had cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say, "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I looked at it because I like Chris Bruno from the TV series "The Dead Zone" and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he thought he was consistent throughout the movie - unlike his costumes. They always slipped into all sorts of languages, from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments on how this film differs from the source material. However, the plot of this film is not good in itself. It's just boring, which does not excuse the low budget. A low budget means you must have at least a good story, dialogue and decent action. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on half-hearted CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
