VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The plot is predictable, and it is eally cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason I have not given the film is another matter, other than that ... This is a movie you can not definitely watch ..... I feel while watching the film. The idea behind the film was an interesting clich√©. I bring Country Bumpkins in the city, blah blah blah, but I think it might have been a bit better if it just would not have been so cheesy, very bad, I think of the idea to the screen. The plot is sometimes somewhat predictable, but I can always say that dancing is pretty good. The Breakdance Battle Twist was good ..... IF you simply snap the film, watch the dance scenes and your own dialogue might make it can be a 5 ... lol
