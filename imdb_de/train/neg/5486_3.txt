First of all, the film starts with a really stupid remark: a 10-year-old girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides that it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands, and then causes a horrific accident killing the Mama .... duh .... I'm sorry, there is probably no 10-year-old so dumb. The rest of the movie does not get much better. After the death of the mother by the seemingly dumbest 10-year-old in the world, the father moves the family to Genova (Italy), where he is supposed to teach at a local university, but here is the crucial point: He does not speak any word Italian then has the small one Girl "visions" of mum (who killed her) and often subsequent night fear, which always ends with the father who holds her and confused. Then we are forced to see how this family constantly gets lost and then found and then hugged and then cried and lost and then found (followed, of course, more hugs and weeps) to the point where I wished myself a kind of natural disaster Just get rid of all those stupid, ignorant people on the planet. Do not get me wrong because I love indies, but an indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is just ridiculous and pointless. It's really a shame that this movie was based on such bland characters that were delayed in such scenarios because the locale was interesting.
