Odd Slasher movie by producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest success, Band said he would never shoot "real killer movies" because he felt that little dolls and big monsters had added a fantasy element that made movies better - people killing each other , are therefore real and less funny. A nice philosophy and a real shame that Band, who had destroyed the Full Moon studio through potentially sloppy shops, became so desperate for home theater profits that he did exactly what Blockbuster wanted, sacrificing creativity and originality. The team behind this also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Birth Rite' - both equally bland compared to the full moon standard. Debbie Rochon is in the usual top shape here as a newcomer to a group of dudes and Dudettes, who decide to come up with a story about a "murder club". It does - as one would of course do - everything to get involved and then panic, because it was not a true story and stupid Mrs. Rochon believed it and now everyone has to run around, get covered in blood and maybe not kill themselves. The choice is there and in relation to this film it is yours ... not recommended, but not too bad either.
