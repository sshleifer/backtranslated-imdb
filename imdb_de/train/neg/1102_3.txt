First of all, I have to admit that both of the films I've seen of this director have been seen without a title and may have missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but after playing two of his films, I wish I had not even tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. These are ten different storylines that connect with each other. This is not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (really tiny). The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have jobs and only a degree. The best figure is the young girl from the Balkans. Their emotions are reflected here every damn day by immigrants. That's all. The only great character. Everybody else makes his own life hell. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting plays with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the movie? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, read this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, you will not find any imitation in an original Jarmusch. And under no circumstances will you see the film by Ondricek, Septej (Whisper.). If you do not like homophobic stereotypes.
