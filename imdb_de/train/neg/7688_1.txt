Terrible movie with a budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets, bad acting, and a terrible story about aliens using their discarded meat as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (not enough to bother) and a figure with an egg beater replacing one of his hands. (Yes, you read that correctly.) <br /> <br /> A saving grace was a song performed by a punk / new wave band on the "talent show" (how ironic is that?), which, I believe, "I" is a heat-seeking rocket. "Apart from that, this is not worth your time, not even on a" so bad is good "level - watch out for cheesy alien films, but everyone else should be free move. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
