I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they made this horrible movie. The thing with the plastic weapon and the toy car that can go into another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were so funny in the first two films, but the terrorists in this film are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
