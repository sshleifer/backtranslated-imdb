I can not believe that the Indian film industry is still spreading such third-rate slags as Waqt. For a start, the story is absolutely implausible? The spoiled son is thrown out of his family's house to teach him some self-employment. So what does he do? He immediately wins a national talent competition by making some star jumps in front of a jury (I honestly do not joke here). In the meantime, his father dies of lung cancer but considers it a secret to the son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands , <br /> <br /> The spectacle is worthy in its hammock? No attempt was made to try and act convincingly on any of the main actors in this film. As usual with Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the real world worries. To be honest, the intelligent viewers are the main losers when making such horrible films that made the mistake of seeing such a movie. The actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar are still worshiped as gods by the people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
