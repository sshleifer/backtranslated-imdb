This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this dubious honor? but not anymore The drama in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and was dwarfed only by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. It does not know if it should be an S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Look under heavy intoxication or when you are bedridden and need a distraction with leather. This script should be reworked into a porn, it would not be very elaborate and would have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porno, would not do Dolf Lundgren's career the damage this movie has.
