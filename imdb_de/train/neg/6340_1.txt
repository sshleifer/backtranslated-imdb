That's the kind of movie that I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it presents a sketch of the Colombian conflict that is so clichéd and dumb that it is an insult to all Colombian people. The appearances are Godawul, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pathetic) to Bejarano to Fanny Mickey (resulting from a Tim Burton nightmare) to Díaz, who strives to bring such a vivacious figure to life - dimensional, so clichéd and so poorly written, all he can still work with is a mustache. Not to mention the unsatisfactory ending, a gore feast so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood squeal. It fails in every way, whether film, art direction, costumes, make-up, editing and above all directing. Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and accountability from this common fiasco.
