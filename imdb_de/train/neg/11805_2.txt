Look at the original with the same title from 1944! This movie made for TV is just awful! Although it (as far as I can tell) almost uses the same dialogue, it just does not work! Is it the acting, the poor director? OK, so made for TV, but why look a bad copy when you get the great original in your hands? Especially because you will be spoiled with the plot and will not enjoy the original as if you had seen it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter once), but all are for the worse! The actors who play the roles here simply do not fit! You just do not believe them and who could surpass Edward G. Robinson's performance of the original? If you want, just look at it after seeing the original and even then you will be very brave if you see through it! It is almost a sacrilege!
