Generally beautifully photographed and sent, but the writing is very slippery. There are scenes of such incredible imagination that there is no joy in watching. The fact that the young lover, for example, has a twin brother, is so fancy that I moan loudly. And the "emotion-bulb connection" also seems to be simple. <br /> <br /> I do not know. If you want to drink a few glasses of wine and relax with some pretty scenes with a few flamboyant comedies, this is a pretty good movie. No great effort of the viewer required. But the Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is usually much, much better.
