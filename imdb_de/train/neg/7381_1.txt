Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice is over 50% of the movie ... Why? Because apparently the script and the story were rewritten during the shoot, and they need to change their dialogue for the continuation of the story as they have multiple versions. From the beginning you only scratch your head, because the overdubs not only distract, but make no sense. When I had the end, I just scratched my head, because the movie was so pointless and the end did not even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. In this movie, I stopped seeing Seagal directly in video because they were getting worse and worse.
