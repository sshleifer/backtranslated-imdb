This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've studied it mainly out of curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I had not. I turned it off in less than an hour, though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It disregards the novel very much and changes all sorts of factors. If the movie did not manage to release itself in the last 50 minutes or so (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think so many people say that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilmable, but that special rendition could have been done without it. I almost want to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice.
