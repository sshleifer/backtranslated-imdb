((NB: Spoiler warning as it is!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a teen slasher movie - the spam-in-a-cabin genre, as piqued by Joe Bob Briggs , If you are looking for Roshambo, it is not and it would not be. I am desperately unimpressed by engravings in her cinematographs, in directing or acting. Second, this was not Zuniga's first horror movie, it was her first appearance, cinema, television or whatever. For what it is worth; Daphne Zuniga is neither Susan Sarandon nor Katherine Hepburn. Third, you even have to give a lame slasher prop. Certainly, it follows the profoundly insulting formulaic message of his genre: any young woman who has or shows an interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest season is now. Besides this, there is also the cut the sweet, virgin protagonist! Now there is a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage of its beliefs! Interestingly, this was the only film role of ingenue. Another One Hit Wonder, except that this term gives the girl too much credit. <br /> <br /> (Then this film probably has one of the highest proportions of one-movie actors in history.) Of the 19 acclaimed actors, thirteen of them have never been seen in any other film, three of them in one another movie from the same producers, only one other than Zuniga has up to six screen credits, what was it that "has been and has never been a mutual"?) <admitted, i saw this long ago late in the evening, when I was bored and never expected to be so boring in my life again, but I see no reason to chase all those involved and throw them into the office incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
