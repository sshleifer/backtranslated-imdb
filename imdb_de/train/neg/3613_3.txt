It's a bad movie, but I have to give it to the lead actress in this movie ... Francine Forbes. She seemed the least personable and I personally thought she was cute. Too bad that it only appears in another movie in the database. Apart from that, the movie is filled with ridiculous bruises and fake death scenes. People are stabbed and GUSH like two liters of blood! But if you like bad horror movies, I recommend this one very much.
