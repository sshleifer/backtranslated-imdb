I'm not sure why this movie received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> When I saw "Bang" on television one evening, I was bored with the nonsensical, random plot that appeared on the screen. The entire film seems to be nothing more than an exercise in pointless, artistic-farther indulgence of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / writer calls a moniker with a name only reinforces this feeling of presumption. <br /> <br /> Those interested in indie flicks should better look for something better and dare, I say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.
