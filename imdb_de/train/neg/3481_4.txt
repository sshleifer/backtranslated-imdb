May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say that, but anyone who is smart enough to read this can probably find that every action is right from the beginning. I like it. I did not hate the kind of films that insult your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable when it came to the necessary happy ending. There were funny pieces along the way, but few were original. At least it was not for the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only salvation feature. Everyone else is a cardboard stand, and surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done this to someone as a favor. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a harmless, but not stimulating 90 minutes.
