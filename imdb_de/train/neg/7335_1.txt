This is possibly the worst version of the piece I've ever seen - several times on stage, apart from the movie. <br /> <br /> A very nice idea for the setup - the American South can give a credible backdrop to the extreme reaction around Hero's alleged offense. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very good Beatrice with a particularly bad performance. Waterston, a good actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The worst performance is in the role of Don John - she makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature modeled after the villain who binds the maiden to the railroad tracks, fits the Keystone heads of Dogberry and his men - but acting makes you want to fear. <br />> One of the successful setups is the scene in which they make Benedict believe that Beatrice loves him - if she acted competently, that would be great. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict coming closer is well produced. <br /> <br /> All in all, I had to force myself to keep watching, but it certainly did not hold my attention. <br /> <Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> I'm almost 40 years old with regards to the comments above. I have seen Shakespeare's stage and film productions for over two decades. When trying to defend your friends, I suggest that you talk to the piece instead of attacking other reviewers if you are not sufficiently armed with the facts. However, I can assume from your dislike of youth that you have a sufficient age in which the behavior of earlier days is more in keeping with your tastes. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer can be a skilled and charismatic performer.
