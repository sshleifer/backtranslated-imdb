If you offer enough money to an actor, obviously he will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he earned should be made available to his fans as an excuse to participate in such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects from the B-movies of the fifties, and the rest of the cast was even worse. How bad the acting was, in my opinion, the second best performance. The English was awfully accented, and I think nobody could really speak English. They just memorized what the words should sound like instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character "lifelike" as well as real.
