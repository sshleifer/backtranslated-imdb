This is a bad B-movie disguised as a mockumentary. The documentary filmmaker has almost as much time and dialogue as any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary" that they might want to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not really a mockumentary is the least of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing revealing about the porn business. It's not that bad. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity for a R rated movie is mild. <br /> <br /> Someday somebody will do a good imitation about the porn industry. That's not it
