I'm watching this on the sci-fi channel. It's so terrible that I can not stop looking at it! I'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone connected to this movie. Part of the camera work is good. Most of it is very questionable. There are some decent actors in the movie. Too bad that they are surrounded by the relatives of the director. Only then could they have qualified for a film! Music was a bit better than acting. If you look at this, I hope that there was absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes continuation) is coming now ... I think I'll skip it! Jason
