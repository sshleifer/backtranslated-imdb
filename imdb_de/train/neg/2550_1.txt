It was the slogan "in the tradition of the American pie" that led me to rent this movie. What I got was a piece of garbage in the style of Jackass, with the main difference being that this movie looks like a Citizen Kane compared to Jackass the Movie. <br /> <br /> This movie regretted me rewarding other films 1 in 10, so I can not go underneath it now. As a result, some bad movies look like cinematic masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and I rarely do that. But it was just too boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Let yourself fall on your head when you were a child? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and are your breasts everything you ever think about? At least something has to be wrong. <br /> <br /> My tip: stay away from it. Even if you're in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you'll definitely regret it.
