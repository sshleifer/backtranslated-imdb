* Spoliers * Keep reading if you have not seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Pick up after the end of the depressing "Phantasm II"; The Tall Man abducts Mike, while Reggie and his new boy Tim spend most of the movie bringing him back, rather than ending up as slaves on the "Tall Planet" Red Planet. This is going to be really stupid: The thief in the light pink hearse was just for comic relief and the black karate chick (I can not remember her name) was so irritating that I could not wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character. This looks almost like Tim's character, who comes too late and is ultimately the hero, but ... that's not how it works. At the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by the killer dwarves, Mike is implanted a silver bullet in his skull, the bullets get Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and there's no one left to stop The Tall Man. The villain wins - what about a surprising turn of events in the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and not released until '95, and the end of this was definitive at the time and though it's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and fitting ending to this weird little series. But the fourth part changes this ending and adds nothing new, but more bad jokes and an even worse and more senseless ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
