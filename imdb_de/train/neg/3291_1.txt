Let me first say that I'm not a Dukes fan, but after this movie, the series looked like Law and Order. The worst part was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if they've ever seen the show, Roscoe was not a tough cop. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with the usual mistakes, cars are torn and it looks like nothing has happened. The worst example of this is when the general meets up with Billy Prickett and the general gets into a mud hole that obviously slows to a close stop but still wins the race.
