"It's hard to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship like a drama with all the same pornographic scenes that are thrown like a good scale and to shuffle like a blaster and make us more like money and things . "- Ellen, the lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, like, on the, like, mouth and things" is like the best that artistic endeavors that have ever been made. Seeing Ellen's hairy arms and Chris masturbating was like the height of my year-long movie experience. But before I start to break new US-20-Something-Airhead-records with my "Like", let me briefly list like the high-like-lights of this visual like a feast: <br /> <br /> 1 Chris does the act with his genitals. And not only that, the way the camera (so eloquently led by Ellen and Patrick) rewarding the viewer with a full-screen shot of Chris's thick white trash after completing the non-Catholic act - that was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more of those scenes in your next movies, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of what started this brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95". A short wh *** and then a hairy, fat, white belly: What more can a movie-goer ask for? Needless to say, I can sit all day watching Chris ejaculate (despite the fact that I'm straight) ... Such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such a style. No less than a total, divine inspiration went into the filming of this sequence - and a whole lot of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not be more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, big arms. The shaky camera close-ups, so skilfully done by our two camera crews (I can not stress that enough), Ellen and Patrick, have often caused confusion over the proper identification of the gender in question. There were several scenes in which we would see a part of the body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but it was often a guessing game: does this part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists Ellen, Patrick, and Whatsame intentionally reject each other because their bodies were ideal for this gendered confusion. It was sometimes hard to guess if you saw a female or male leg. Patrick is so skinny and feminine in his movements, so hairless and untouched, while Ellen and the other girl are so slippery with her thick leg and arms. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that blends seamlessly with the subject of role reversal between the sexes: so totally original and breathtaking. Ellen behaves like a man, always wants sex while her ex-Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen is looking for a buddy. "He has to love The Simpsons, which is pretty much on the left." I am glad that the creators of this film have decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists. Ellen is so refreshing and realistic. The number of "likes" that they and their liberal friends make in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). They have managed to realistically transfer their real inability to the big screen with minimal effort and I welcome them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. The close-ups of the toes. There are loads of things for foot fetishists, which I think is a very liberal, highly recommended way to target sexual minorities. Shoe and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see someone out there CARES. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or better said, KLOTLMAS, offers more than it seems. It's not just a modest little film about flat people in hollow relationships who engage in meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. It's about the light that guides all stupid creatures; The lead light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo-artistic wannabees who have just dropped out of film school and want to attack our senses with a sombre hustle and bustle hoping to win at challenging festivals like Sundance and Cannes to win them over is therefore a real money for a change, with which they will later set Sean Penn and George Clooney for the salvation of this planet and the solution of ALL political problems in the world. Is there a better way to do porn than in the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made the camera here, as stated in the credits, who held the camera while the two were in front of it? You've probably hired some passers-by and put the camera in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and watch my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Cases "At The Nepotism" list.
