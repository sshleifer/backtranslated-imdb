To be honest, this movie is another part of a series of big disappointments. Most of these so-called "masters of horror" are terrible only in terms of their side effects and ridiculous stories ... apart from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie can not act to save their lives ... the shots sounded as if someone was playing bop-it under boommike or something and looked totally unrealistic ... overall, this movie is as scary as Home Alone ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I know not how these directors can sleep at night, knowing that they have ruined the genre some of them have actually understood. ,
