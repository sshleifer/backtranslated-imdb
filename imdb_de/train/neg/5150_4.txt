I got the DVD from the library expecting to get a good idea of ​​what's going on in the background with a big opera production. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The topic had so much potential. The sets in a Wagnerian production must necessarily be thoughtful and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. What we get instead is a smorgasbord of clips moving in big scenes, vaguely helping us with a commentary that does not hold my attention. I especially listened to the background clips of opera music. I was impressed with the enormous effort required to do such a production - it came over fairly well, and the next time I'm in the opera, I'm sure I'll remember that part, though this video - but I felt a bit cheated by the lack of detailed comments and explanations.
