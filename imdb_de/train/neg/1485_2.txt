For your own good, you should ignore any positive reviews about this movie. This strip is STINKS. Well, I like (at least theoretically) low budget horror movies, but this makes the worst mistake a low budget movie can make: It takes WAY too seriously. And unfortunately that's not just the problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the murderous Beane clan of the British Ilses, who was transferred to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately confusing to this movie as you look at it. <br /> <br /> # 1 Why is the biggest name on the CD box Jenna Jameson? She is a below-average-looking woman who can not act, and she plays a subordinate role. ANSWER: She seems to be a well-known porn star (as you undoubtedly read in other reviews), so I think this is a "cameo" performance for her. She gives the movie the necessary "name", it seems. Their top billing is not an indication of their talent, but it's an indication of how UN talent is the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> # 2- How can filmmakers be so stupid to believe that Canada could be ignored as Ireland? It does not even look remotely like Ireland. And the house where the guests / victims reside is this great North American wooden frame Edwardian thing. They should skip the entire Beane theme and develop a story that took place in NA. If you're shooting a movie that's set in Ireland, it's probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and so on) was a REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD Irish accent.) Well, that would not have been so bad if the director did not try to make the next "Night of the Living Dead", but it seems he is. Too bad. He could have had some fun with it. In fact, some scenes were not far from being unintentionally comedic as they were. <br /> <br /> Like the notorious obsession scene, the woman was chained to the table, stripped naked, and then reedded. That's funny, you ask? Well, in the version with the scene deleted, the mutant killer pulls out miles and miles of stomachs gut. After a while, it's actually funny. And which self-human cannibal eats intestine at all? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? No, we eat ham and ribs and drumsticks. Well. <br /> <br /> Some of the other performers were annoying: the whiny, scary Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should be cast as STUD. In fact, he is as big a loser and idiot as his name would suggest. Which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell for him. <br /> <br /> I checked out Gillian Leigh for her link in IMDb, and apparently it's important to know that she graduated high school with honors. I can not decide if it's more amusing or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduating, the honor student does naked softcore porn in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie? If so, they will hopefully get the message: AVOID THIS FATE! TO GO TO UNIVERSITY!!! I could go on and on, but why. If you like Gore, you'll find something redeeming in this movie, but not much else.
