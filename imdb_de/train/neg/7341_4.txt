OK, I'm not a professional film critic, but come on ... a true story. They tunnel under another store to come under the bench and stumble over a grave. At the grave with a passage that goes directly under the bank. OK, I play with you. <br /> <br /> But then they come to the bank and decide to go to sleep. Yes!!! I'm sure, with all the adrenaline they pump through, they'll just fall asleep. <br /> <br /> That makes the whole picture !!!! How lame !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not have to pay to watch this movie.
