Oh man! Now I'm talking about it! As for bad and kitschy horror movies, this movie really was in a class of its own. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie was not originally in English. That's fine, because the synchronization was really extraordinary! Here's my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there's much more of that)? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a playful summary of the interaction between military and scientists. <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can not do that, it's going to be a disaster!" - Military officer: "This is just science-fiction" (he then makes a complete catastrophe, just as the scientist predicted). Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do that, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "You do not know what you are talking about." (He does it and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do that, it's going to kill everyone!" - Military Officer: "That's nonsense" (he kills everyone then) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You get the idea). <br /> <br /> If that was not enough? There were a few scenes that turned out to be instant classics! In one scene the military has literally 10 guys who direct weapons at two unarmed men. The leader yells, "Go and get her!" and all 10 Army guys throw down their weapons one at a time and fight against the two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. There was no love left to detail! This movie even had a hip / optimistic 80s keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And do you trust me? I notice that this review contains some spoilers, but there are so many good things in this epic that I really just scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber comes out only once a decade! A true movie experience! A masterpiece! Impressive!
