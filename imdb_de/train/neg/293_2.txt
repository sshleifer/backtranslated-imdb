Essentially, this movie is about some girls in a Catholic school who end up in trouble because they put red dyes in one of their schoolmate shampoos, and after being reprimanded for the act, they decide to go on vacation to stay in Florida. Along the way, they meet with some boys in a local restaurant and decide that they will meet later in another place. The girls land on a street near the forest and stop for a while. While one of the girls decides to walk around, she sees a murder involving the local sheriff herself. She gets scared and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to look at her and two of them are killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the murderer and taken to the local prison cell. The deputy sheriff in the meantime watches over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer, he ignores both of them and acts as ignorant and everyone else in this film who can not bring two and two together, let alone a lousy detective work to. Best of all was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls, where he decides to rape her in her prison cell, and it seems the girl really wants to be raped by this man and the bare breast scene that I had to admit was good before was your lips meet with other things. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song", in which Frankie Avalon only plays a different character part with the same motif. It's not a movie it's worth renting, not even for a low-budget movie of the 80s. The end was the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie and I had to get my money back!
