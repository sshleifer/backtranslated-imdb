I've seen a lot of crap in my time, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free show in New York the other day. I can only hope that they show the funny version to paying customers. The big laughs were sparse, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were at best one-dimensional. A highlight is a fun dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and the only scene I really laughed about. Besides, I can only remember randomness and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans might be disappointed. I know, I expected more from it. But in short, I would definitely not recommend participating in a free show or paying for this movie.
