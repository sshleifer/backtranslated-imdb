I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems to be hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves you hoping - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other movies of the 70s / 80s. But I forgot how important part of the dialogue can be in a movie, and in this movie they are absolutely ..... garbage! The film locations were also attractive, but the hopeless, overbearing and forced dialogues brought it down to zero. Besides, I'm pretty allergic to the world of motorsport and I'm not interested in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than the one in this movie (and that says something !!). I really expected better from this movie and was very disappointed that I was so disappointed.
