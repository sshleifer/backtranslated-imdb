The basic formula for the original series was: take someone, let the audience like them, and put them in mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes between 1964 and 1968. <br /> <br /> Now we are jumping 40 years after 2004. We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a slightly less diligent college kid, with his friend Fermat, a young know-it-all. They are abducted by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird for the school holidays in the island paradise on which the family Tracy lives. Almost immediately they remain in the care of Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin, while the adults rescue John from Thunderbird 5, which was damaged by a staged accident. This is all part of The Hood's plan to take over Tracy Island so he can steal the Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> ?? To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is as slack as that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the play more wood than that of the (fiberglass) dolls, the effects, anything but special and Hans Zimmer's score ??? What little of Barry Gray's glorious theme was present shone through Zimmering's brilliant orchestration. The rest of the score was decidedly unforgettable. In fact, part of the score was broadcast on the radio the following week and did not recognize it! In fact, worked Ron Cook good as Parker, he and Sophia Myles when Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material they could have been a show stopper. The CGI work was what I would have called a pioneer - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main vehicle was simply wrong. The original series models at least moved as if they had mass. <br/> <br /> Another sore point is that the entire production was a long series of product placements, from every vehicle built by Ford to the full content. The Tracy Freezer is powered by Ben & Jerry's produced. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed the movie a lot, but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', which targets his age group, has not really helped the legend of Thunderbirds. When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with "The Motion Picture", a whole new life was breathed in turn, which then lasted about 20 years. With this film, Frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds series. I predict that this film, like "The Avengers" and "The Saint", will be forgotten within 6 months, so that the original series will get its 'classic' status.
