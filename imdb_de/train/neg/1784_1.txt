OK, I took that from the TV and missed the start. The movie had about ten seconds in the titles (I'm assuming), so if something happened, what I've missed. <br /> <br /> Many people say Mark Hammill is here, I did not see him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis, and obviously Stephen King, who made a really horrible drama as a cemetery guard. Alice Krige looks pretty, apart from the scenes where she has the cat's face or is in a strange state -up. <br /> <br /> Even the opening titles will never explain exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence, I assume that they are feline bipeds that live by depriving people of vitality. I assume they live long, and these two may be the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add a very large dose of incest (yes, I thought it was a bit suspicious too) , Killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the two main characters and too many cameos to distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
