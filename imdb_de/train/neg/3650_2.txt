No, laughs anyway. Yes, I tracked the entire train accident, but only so that I do not wonder later whether Cleese had come to his senses in the last part. (No, he did not.) <br /> <br /> This can be historically interesting to see that British "humor" thirty years ago contained black "jokes" like these. <br /> <br /> However, what bothers me even more is reading the comments of the other reviewers, who recognize that this is not very good, and then turn around and cast high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies you've seen are even worse than these, then I certainly regret your agonizing existences. <br /> <br /> The humor of this show seems to be aimed at small children, but not the theme. Who is that for? People who like repetitive and lengthy double takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a '77 trip) and other "low" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny and also a kid to me. They have tried to make jokes run. However, this is sucked by Schlock. I'm afraid it's the end of civilization if this stuff is really accepted as rewarding. Next, you'll tell me that boulevard television is popular. :(
