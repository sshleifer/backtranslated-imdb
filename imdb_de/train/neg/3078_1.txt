I did not think a horror comedy movie on both fronts could be so horrible ... really awful. The fact that it does not take itself seriously (usually a good thing) is against it, especially because the actors are so wooden that you would really swear they read playing cards. In the end ..... The MST3K version has as always a few laughs ....
