I have just seen Adam Had Four Sons for the first time, and it struck me that I believe the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter spoke in his account of Adam Stoddard about the same values ​​and family traditions that you would have heard from our 26th President without some of the louder aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all Stoddard sons serve in World War I. In this case, the youngest loses only one eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a female buddy gets into this whole male household and disturbs things? That's Susan Hayward's job here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries a son, has an affair with another, and begins a game for the third. It is an early forerunner of her kind who later earned her an Oscar in I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I suspect that with such a mighty decorum as was Theodore Roosevelt, and Warner Baxter is all scared to tell Father what's going on The Sons and also their governess Ingrid Bergman. Here the plot is a bit stupid. Bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial setbacks in the business. Bergman must be let go. She returns to France and returns years later to the family when the children are big. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe the kids need a governess now. Hayward is right when she sees her that the children have not brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have got on with her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the movie I have got cut out. Maybe that's the reason for the many action holes we have. It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not make another movie together in the fifties when Hayward was on their heights and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm ready to believe that a large part of Ingrid lay on the tailoring floor.
