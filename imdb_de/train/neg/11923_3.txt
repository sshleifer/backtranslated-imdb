An illegal immigrant opposes the social support system and has catastrophic consequences for many. Well filmed and played, even if the story is a bit forced, the slow tempo really triggers the end. The feeling of being lost in the big city is conveyed effectively. The little person who has been lost in the big company is something we can all relate to, but I can not support it if you watch this movie.
