Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasures in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little scrape on their hungry faces. Wild and his merry men must find a way to free themselves from the menu so they can dig up an old Spanish galleon with gold bars. <br /> <br /> After the crew has taken a little eternity push and push, 5 crazy prisoners board the boat and blaspheme wild annoying health tips. Now it's a battle of the mind, who gets the treasure and who sees what the inside of a shark looks like in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Little is Wild in shape and wears exactly what he wore "The Naked Prey" 10 years ago and he has stayed in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Set on a budget of 75 cents.
