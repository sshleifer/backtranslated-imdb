I had never heard of it and then found out that it was the man with the deadly lens that I had heard of but had not seen. Connery's presence made me buy it, and it's not good. It wants a kind of cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mash, but it's just not funny, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It acts as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it comes to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his co-workers who do not work. It's almost as if the first cut was too long, and the first half was shut down to cover the entire atomic bomb ransom and suicide bomber attacks that I think should be laughed out, but not so funny either. The shooting is excellent, but the studio looks like cheap TV. I could not believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire, and Elmer Gantry did so. Just laugh: Connery throws his wig away, puts on his helmet and jumps out of an airplane. It never makes Never Say Never awesome again.
