Is there a book entitled "How to Present a Movie with Every Clich√©" Man Against Nature? If not, ants would make an excellent source for the chapter on killer insects. At no point in his 100-minute run, Ants has found a single piece of originality. I think the most surprising thing about Ants is that the movie was actually stretched to 100 minutes. The lineup, the characters, the various deals, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented were taken any number of times. and in most cases much better. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage movies were filmed in the '70s because they all basically have the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can someone tell me what makes Myrna Loy in God's name? that monkey jerk of a movie? A woman as talented and stylish as Loy had earned more than Ants as one of her last films.
