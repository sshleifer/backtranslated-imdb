This must be one of the worst movies ever. The graphics were awful, the acting was B-Movie and the effects were only Nintendo 64 qualified. They would think that they would make a little more effort. Of course, this is a scifi channel movie, so you have to assume it's a low rate, but it takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, shaking your head in the incredulous movie, this film is well suited. <br /> <br /> Even though there are some well-known actors and actresses, it's hard to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth the time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics may have been good in the 60s or early 70s, but come on, this is 2009! I will not spend any spoilers, let's just say, if you played Jurassic Park on Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth the 2 hours It took the thing to go through
