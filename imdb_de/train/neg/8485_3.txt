From horrible death scenes to guns firing without making noises, to a character called Fiend. It's all tiresome, slow moving, unimaginative. It was okay to see the guy in the cape and the hunchback lurking around. Visually, it was scary and probably involved the moviegoers of that time, but even in 1936 one would think that even a film like this would have had a little more imagination and truthfulness. I've always waited for something important to happen while people stand around making speeches and behaving as if they were posing at a picnic in the office. And then there are the bullets mentioned in a previous commentator. The best indication might have been to look for a water stain in a person's pocket.
