When I saw the commercial for this topic, I really wanted to see it. Forgive me, but it's been so long since I saw it that I can not remember how it went. Suffice to say, the movie I saw was unlike the "movie" they sold me to. <br /> <br /> I was bored, upset and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink it even further with this terrible reggae music. Not exactly atmospheric music for a horror movie, right? I think if you've never seen the ad (or a trailer, I suppose), you might think that this is a hot stuff. The trade was much better for my money.
