my friend bought the movie for 5? (It's not even worth a penny) because they wrote it was American cake. But we would soon find out that there is a long way from the American pie to this piece of crap. It's not even a comedy, it's really a really bad documentary. Not only the story is bad, also the picture and the sound are bad. They drank alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. If you see this movie, do not buy it, but spend your money on something else. If you are tormenting yourself, do not invite your friends unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
