If you want a backward homosexual karate expert to break out on tough Mexican gangsters who keep trying for an hour and a half, then this is the movie for you. If not, choose another DVD from the 20-c filing, the only place where this movie belongs. The spectacle was so terrible that I had to force myself to see it to the end. The cover makes it so cool, but it's just another cheap gangster movie class 2, based on the 2g lines and a key, bloody street and threat. I would not buy or rent this movie unless you plan to be stoned and plotted, cut and act, it does not matter to you. it really is the worst movie in human history !!!
