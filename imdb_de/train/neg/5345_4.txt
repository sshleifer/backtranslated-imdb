If you manage to create "classic Meyer" titles / intro, you can go over everything. But would you want it? I did not find much there to dig my teeth. I suppose, if you go into it with low expectations, you will be thrilled (a la Charlie's Angels.). But for my money I would like something more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel as if I'm begging for flour meal at Master's foot. The man got the goods. but he just will not share.
