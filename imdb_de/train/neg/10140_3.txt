This movie should never have been done. <br /> <br /> What a shame on the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire convincing actors and make a real movie. Very thin plot and unconvincing lines. Almost funny, and that's a shame for an action movie ... <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> They always play the same "settings" of a stealth plane way. They saw it, and it was not worth repeating three or four times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from filmmaking. <br /> <br /> His films are getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were bad, but this movie is even worse.
