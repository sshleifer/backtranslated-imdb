Smother was perhaps the longest not quite 90 minutes of my life. There was no laughter; I can not remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was terribly ill-tempered like a middle-aged chain smoker, the textbook cocky mother figure, a ruthlessly irritating woman who is obviously suffering from some sort of personality disorder. She is manipulative, engaging, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and most boring of everything. <br /> <br /> I think I should mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long line of film clich√©s-the dull, socially inappropriate distant relative trying to break into "The Industry," the gruff and boring, but somehow still lovable father, the mild woman who can easily. "I do not take it any more (but eventually it goes over the discord and comes home resigned), the flock of uninterrupted dogs who like to chew pillows while everyone is gone, etc. God, what snoring, I've never been a Diane Keaton fan, and Smother just reminded me why overacting is overacting, no matter how many pics you made at your best age, their attempts at physical comedy were especially demeaning Director thought? <br /> <br /> Although I like Dax Shepard and sometimes Liv Tyler can tolerate it, their performances were so dull and boring that it was clear that none of the actors condemned this movie. Keaton's endless, self-absorbed rattling was unbearable, and at times Shepard's dislike of her seemed genuine, and at the end of the movie I wanted to beat her myself. <br /> <br /> Awful.
