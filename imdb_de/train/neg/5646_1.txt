Absolutely predictable, silly show about a man who killed his wife when he mowed her while driving, claiming he was exhausted. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car after killing his wife? This question was not noticed by the authors. The story then tells of a psychologist and her failed marriage, linked to the failed marriage of a woman-killing blackout rider. An omniscient mother and a one-dimensional child are wholly thrown in, and the whole builds on a foreseeable delimitation and abrupt finale. Are police psychologists so easily absorbed? Deadly writing, with which the actors do their best, but are doomed to failure. This is similar to a harlequin romance. Do not waste your time watching this unless you strive for it.
