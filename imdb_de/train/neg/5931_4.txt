This movie should have only lasted 10 minutes. I mean, there's really only 10 minutes of viewable content in this thing (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film was promising. As the movie begins with brief comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more material from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a decent job on one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Caves Performance makes you even more ready to see more Cohen whose wit and well-spoken words have already tickled your imagination. But as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of lengthy, boring performances that are literally done by a group of people who do not even have the slightest attraction to keep you in their place. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-ups of singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker really believe in insulting the audience by adding "false applause" to these infinite, nasty performances? The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you saw. There is not a single footage from Cohen's past. In fact, apart from a few photographs of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you summarize all the minutes that Cohen speaks, it may not even reach ten minutes. But those 10 minutes are torn between the catastrophic camera work in which some of the most unsightly people who scream Cohen's lyrics are captured. If you've ever decided to waste your money on this movie, do not do it! Just throw it in the trash and at least save your time.
