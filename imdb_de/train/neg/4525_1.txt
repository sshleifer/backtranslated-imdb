Some beautiful scenery, but the story itself - in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt, doing Egyptological things in the most unsurpassable manner (eg, flash photography in the graves), dealing with old parchment, etc.) A black-market grassroots war, and somehow (within two days, not less!) becomes this wartime epicenter of the war - is more puzzling than any puzzle the Sphinx has ever posed. Down is just as horrible as the British visiting scholar (that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt, and even less about antiques is certainly the fault of the writers, but she is annoying that everything comes out, it's her own fault.) And the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems as confused by the process as I am. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and Co. <br /> <br /> It pays to pay attention to a ridiculously dated scene in which Down cries out against and blames all male scholars for failure as a scientist, while Hollywood bathed under the softest light. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the movie shrieking, rushing, and hugging every guy she can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note for prospective Egyptologists: Take Arabic or Arabic for one or two years at the graduate school. It will really help in the long run ...
