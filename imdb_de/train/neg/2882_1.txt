This movie is the biggest steaming bunch of you, you know, what came from Wichita Kansas and grew up, I actually know that 90% of the movie was Bogus. Apart from the names of some victims, nothing else was right. The movie looks like it was done with Father's handy camera. He had footage that I believe came from another movie, along with footage from a slaughterhouse. Usually I enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of bad acting, poorly prepared or nonexistent sets and a very boring and short ending. I recommend you not to waste your money on this movie or you will apologize. crunch
