The plot of this film depends on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not that it's a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man murders a young girl without provocation, without reason and without emotions. This girl was somebody's daughter. I do not think that a father who cared so much for his own daughter would have been so cold-blooded to another's daughter. Or could alternatively have been so cold-blooded and still worry about his own daughter and take care of her. And the idea that a convicted murderer actually asks his victim's parents to take care of and take care of his daughter is unimaginable. I thought that changing Bakula's eye color made him look more cold and threatening than he usually is. They could not look into his eyes at all.
