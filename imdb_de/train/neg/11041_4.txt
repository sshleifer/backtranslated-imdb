The show is average. It does not make me laugh much. However, I think Courtney really undermines it. She does not look natural. She has these three possibilities to talk about, all robots. She speaks softly (without intonation), she speaks normally (without intonation), or she does that where she begins to speak normally and gradually begins to scream. But her screaming is like "Let's pretend I'm screaming because I should not be too loud on the set". <br /> <br /> She is always aware that this cute actress is doing this weird thing. It's annoying. They can not really understand their personality because it does not generate emotions and does not get excited. She has this man who does all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and simple.
