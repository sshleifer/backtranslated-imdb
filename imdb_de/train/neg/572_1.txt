Ugh, what should I say differently than ig. I rented this movie because it was called a sequel to the original vampires. This movie could not have been a lamer. The absence not only in the plot, but the spectacle is cruel. In combination with some obvious action holes, this film is very hard to look at. Often I questioned my own rationality as I watched the movie, long after history jumped the shark. Here is a selection of lamer aspects ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional "Slayer" insists on sleeping at night outdoors. He wakes up to a crying woman sitting in the middle of nowhere, no more than ten feet away. He comforts her immediately, without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seduction, and lets it happen with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters is Zoe, who was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she has these "experimental" pills Getting her in Mexico City, she's fine, even though her body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> Guard outside the monastery where the hero stays the night is killed by vampires, the hero leaves Next day, he returns one day later, just to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this one Movie.
