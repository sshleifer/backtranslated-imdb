This movie is great. I looked at it recently with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was alright, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a movie quite different from those horrible Hollywood movies, like the Matrix and STop or My Mom Shoot. It could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like this big claw that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since Domino Pizza's guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like those blurry movies my dad did for my birthday when I turned 6. He tells a complex story with dozens of characters who seem to be completely disconnected, but all eventually meet. It's awesome how this web is woven for everything to happen. I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel. But it needs more aliens. And a pirate.
