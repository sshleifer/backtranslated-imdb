This movie is the worst crap I have ever seen. I literally had a sharp pain in my head when I saw this movie. The CGI was awful and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr. Super Intuitive-I can figure it all out, unless he does not seem to be flying his own helicopter properly. The biggest problem was the splitwork camera work. I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something like that, except it was not different people in the boxes, just close-ups and different views of the same thing. I can only guess that the actors really needed the money because this movie was not worth the movie it was shot on.
