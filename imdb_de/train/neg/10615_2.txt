Strange, how less than 2 hours can work for a lifetime, sitting through such a shallow, uninspired dizziness. If a story is as personal as it was supposed to be for Sally Potter, would not you expect a little passion in your performance? Her acting was completely distant and I did not feel any chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and the tango scenes, which were fiery given the nature of the dance, were instead uncomfortable and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story in the film can be daunting, and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise to see a better actor take on this task instead of sacrificing her passion to her own shyness.
