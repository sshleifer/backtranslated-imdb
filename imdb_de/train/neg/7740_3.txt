This film actually manages to enjoy 2/3 of the journey without thought. Unfortunately, the movie is too "confused". While I know that some of the action skills are standard on "Buddy Cop" movies, I was attracted by the characters who brilliantly defeat themselves, but in the end the movie relies too much on chase chicks, and I've lost interest /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job of making the characters alone and doing their own thing, and we saw who they were early on, and both policemen got identified. We have formed our own opinion, instead of forcibly taking a look at them through constant quarrels. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is too much going on and it is very detrimental to what could have been a pleasurable piece of escapism. Here's what Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) is about at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate deals 2. His affair with a radiosychic 3. He's being investigated by home affairs 4. The murder investigation < br /> <br /> If you add Casey's concerns, you want to find out he wants to be an actor and revenge his father's death. Now some of these things come together and even come together well, but all the plot elements meet in this fake chase, that is so long and pitiful that I barely have time to break my boredom and give a shit on what's going on. The impressive acrobatics of the script writing can not overcome the bad filmmaking. <br /> <br /> As if a ridiculous chase sequence was not bad enough, one that has four separate sections and could take almost half an hour would not be bad enough. Joe Gavilan starts talking on the phone about his real estate business while he's on the phone prosecuted the offender with a gun. All these extracurricular storylines and jokes make it completely meaningless to me whether the criminal is caught or not. At this point, we already forgot or disregarded the act of murder, as several plotting lines and eye-catchers of the chases have stunned us. <br /> <br /> While I could go over the chases and how you ruin a decent story, I will not do it. This could have been a very enjoyable feature film, but it became too big for his British films and became an unnecessary waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett were actually pretty good and a small Gladys Knight performance is worth mentioning. Unfortunately, none of the actors can help make this hopelessly misguided film forgotten. <br /> <br /> This will probably be better than on "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II", which still does not matter movie well. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that were thought to make money. I'm not sure if that's true or not. It is true that you do not need a great movie or actor for a good box office. This movie has no major roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stay with Indiana Jones because you can still walk.
