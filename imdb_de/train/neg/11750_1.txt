The guy who wrote, directed, and stared into that shocking garbage should really consider a caregiver change. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this crap? There are so many talented authors for whom the money could be better spent. I think the idea is great, but the acting, scripting and directing is just awful! The jokes are not so funny, I understand that they should take the Mickey. But do it in style, this movie screams 1995 Saturday night live skits. Why do I say again why studios give hacks like Rob Stefaniuk money - NEVER GIVE A COMEDIAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECTLY AND STAR IN HIS OWN FILM. MORON!
