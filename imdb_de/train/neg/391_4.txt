For the first few seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a very engaging and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the show's producers were able to keep the show relevant rather than "out there." <br /> <br /> The new Season 6 is nothing more than a joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with the business - at all. In the previous seasons, they have been more focused on business tasks - now the focus is mainly on the boardroom, where attendees must do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (ie, lying, trash-talking, kickback, etc.) , The boardroom can be entertaining, but the entertainment is low - Sometimes you wonder if you're watching a replay of an old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for those companies stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the deal with half of the participants who live in tents in Season 6? This is just stupid and has nothing to do with doing business. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for the participants of this season, they all look like idiots. In previous seasons, at least some of the participants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the participants are killing their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems that Donald Trump's massive ego is getting bigger and bigger every season. To be honest, I can not understand why someone with common sense wants to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom usually makes no sense whatsoever, and sometimes it seems he's simply throwing people away, which is worth it. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, NBC, for God's sake, let the show out of the air as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to see. The Apprentice was once a great TV show, but now it's just a big, fat joke.
