Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary about the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial topics, but this could be the first to get popular thanks to TCM. This film is her abortion charge, but she cleverly pervades the subject by introducing eugenics and birth control, giving the impression that they are somehow comparable to abortion. Her writing skills and other filmic skills are evident here, but one may wish she wished she had used them less didactically. If you wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s "Famous Father" looked like, here's your chance. In 1916, fashion and automobiles were also exhibited to increase the interest of this museum piece. It's fun, even if you do not appreciate the propaganda.
