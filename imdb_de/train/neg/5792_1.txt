Another piece of garbage made for the TV! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word film in its most casual form!) I thought Telly Savala's career had bottomed out as he played the voice-over on Tarrant on television as Semi during his visit to Birmingham will be regular, but then I forgot that he was involved! I tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but the cable TV brought the memory in my wake and scream !! <br /> <br /> I like that bit (laughs sarcastically!) in the movie, which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the 1940s, but it's obviously a take on the Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also, the steam train on which the Commandos train shows quite clearly the logo of the JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslav State Railways) on the side of the locomotive, although the manufacturers have tried to obscure them. Why not just film in the UK when most of the movie is playing there? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage and a waste of celluloid!
