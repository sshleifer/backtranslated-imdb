Unlike others, I refuse to call this pathetic apology for a movie a triumph of the substance style (I do not want to give the style a bad name). Still, it's the most accurate description that comes to my mind. <br /> <br /> A meaningless, unpleasant and ultimately meaningless attack on eyes and ears: "Wonderland" leaves open only the question of why the movie was made at all and who gave the green light to the gloomy and confused jumble. A biography of the pornstar John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why he went into the business and how it affected him? Great. Being tied up, compelling, entertaining. Enlightening and fascinating at over a million levels (and I have no interest in porn). But ended a confusing, violent Rashomon-style study on a series of murders Holmes was linked to after his career ended? Who the hell cares? What insights do we gain? This movie completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes - that he was a pornstar! "Wonderland" could have been just as good with anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult movie star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things a thousand times worse, the picture looks packed with Jerkoff gimmicks - annoying editing of machine guns, sloppy dogma-95 camerawork, unnecessary split-screen graphics and animations, etc. In the absence of a captivating story and a unique main character The director (and I use the term casual) has thrown together a dozen techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie, including the trendy, bleach-bypass look of " Narc "or" Traffic ". or "minority report"; the desperate, often incomprehensible style of "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later;" the fullness of all moments of silence with an old, old song, around the epoch of the soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow;" the groovy, retro title sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can". The list goes on and on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I had real hopes. "Wonderland Avenue" has been around for years; If the context of the killings had been highlighted instead of the murders themselves, I think it would have worked. Had the murders (and Holme's growing involvement in shady L.A. types) signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging 70s, I think the film could have meaning; it could have had a purpose. As it is - meaningless. Futile. Who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders that are generally unknown to the public? The case is not famous enough to deserve such careful consideration. <br /> <br /> This film should have been the third act of the "John Holmes Story". That's it. Period. And it could have worked. What's this? Oh, right, right, they did not want to tell a traditional rise and fall story. They did not want to do "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted her movie to be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they succeeded. There is a big difference between these films and "Wonderland". The difference is that the movies are good. <br /> <br />
