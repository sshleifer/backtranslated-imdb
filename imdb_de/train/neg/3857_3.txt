I was hoping this movie, like other genres, would be entertaining. However, it was lame and I did not have to laugh much. Maybe look at HBO or if you have a free lease and need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying for it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward and it could be fun if the script were better. Jason Lee can be funny, and he laughs a few times here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just do not go. The direction is weak, but directing is not so important. I think the main drawback is that it's just not funny. See something else, do not waste your time here.
