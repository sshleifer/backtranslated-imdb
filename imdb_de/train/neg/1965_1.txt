Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and frolic in horror. The result "Dead Above Ground" is a terrible piece of garbage. Had I noticed his name in connection with THIS special movie, I would have put him back, but no, I did not have any glasses and that's why I missed him, damn it, I really need to bring her while I do the video shopping. The first question would be, who the hell is the target audience for that? It's almost like a "scary" children's movie, but then there's no babes and a bit of gore and a few bad words. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone looking for them with farm tools from SOME kind. It seems that a man opens a bed and breakfast with a checkered past, a child-killing witch, in which children have collected teeth. Probably the realtor did not mention something. Of course, there's a little girl spirit these days to warn the real girl living there that something bad is going to happen. It does, and there were also two Bubbas squatting on the property when the new owner took over the helm. This whole thing looks like a trash for children made for cable on Halloween, except for things that are not suitable for small children. This is not only mediocre but also confused. Kudos to Anchor Bay, who has done so, considering it is common with good releases. Great Britain gets a phantasm box set, we get "The Tooth Fairy". It hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute garbage.
