An interesting idea for a movie that shows both the last dragon in the world and the fight he and a bad have in common. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, and Bowen (Dennis Quaid) brought him to the Dark Lord, who gave him half of his heart. Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. In the meantime, Bowen uses a new friend, Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to receive rewards for killing dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco's ears, both feel that the pain in one of them is hurt or killed. With Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for the Best Visual Effects Oscar. Worth seeing!
