The nightmares of a woman fuel her fear of being buried alive. The deceitful husband wants her dead and decides to use her phobia by putting her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement abominable, spooky creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody raid are pretty funny beheaded heads are really terrible. Better you see "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect any first-class entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to have fun.
