There are a number of problems with this movie, but in the end it was trying to do too little. The baseline story is pretty good, but the money just was not there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget has really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer / director) has received writing credits for "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", which was a hit at the box office. However, this film was supported by Disney with considerable funds. Honestly, this is a good example of when you should not do a movie. Had he waited a few more years, the technology would have made the cost of many effects cheaper. (Not to mention that he could start a business with money.)
