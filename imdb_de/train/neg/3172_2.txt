This movie is made easy, unoriginal garbage. I sometimes like romantic comedies. A good meal is like eating ice cream for dinner. It is not something you will do all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how unwise you are. In this movie, I thought about how stupid I was because I was sitting all the time. Everything that screamed made it cheap. In fact, it looks like they overexposed the film at certain points because it's so washed out. It also has cheesy CGI and lame sets. <br /> <br /> The letter was clunky. I know that in a screwball comedy you can usually expect some plot problems, but it does not usually bother you because you're laughing. This movie is so funny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and unbelievable behavior. Events were inserted into the movie to move the characters from one scene to another or to present them. Sure, that's how all movies work, but you should not realize it's happening. Inelegant. That's the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There was almost nobody in the movie who was really sympathetic. I did not care who ended up with whom, as long as they all stayed away from me to hell, and I did not have to listen to them talk about it. Why should the film's only really cool character, the Paul Rudd character, have anything to do with the totally bitchy, patronizing control freak played by Eva Longoria? In addition, almost all characters involved have consistently found the worst solution for every situation. A heterosexual man pretends to be gay for five years only to go out with (and bathe with) a woman he is attracted to? The best moment to feel good was a happy ending for the same man in which he meets Rudd's equally annoying, kleptomaniac sister. Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they find something better to appear on the street.
