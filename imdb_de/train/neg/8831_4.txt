After hearing so many people raving about this movie, I thought I would try. Except that they are incredibly slow, which I do not mind, as long as the wait is worth it, but it just is not so. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this movie just does not sound right. The reaction of the 4 men changes from shock to finding the body to complete indifference during fishing. If they were men who would like to fish, they would have just reported the corpse and said they had discovered it after their fishing trip ... Why bind the body to a tree on earth, go fishing and then say all that you found the body 2 days ago? It's so hard to watch a movie, knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the urban population, one might think that at least one of them might be curious who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except for the panties ... which scenario leads to this? If she was then raped, then why the panties? If she was raped with the clothes, then why should she take off her panties afterwards? If she has not been raped, then why take all of her clothes off her panties ... and provide you with evidence to remove them? I really can not imagine a realistic scenario that would cause someone else to be killed to steal his clothes so you can fill your stall! Well, but it is only visible and only because despite the bad writing the spectacle is strong.
