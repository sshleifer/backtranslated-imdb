Claire Denis' films seem to fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and intimate. "L'intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as bad as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Well, since I saw "Chocolat". I've decided to see every new movie Denis makes. And I was always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and moving as her first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis regulars: an older but still great Béatrice Dalle, who seems to be in the movie, just about her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her rich cleavage and her abundance to show off some nice coats; the black of "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin and this Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera hung on him for so long that I was annoyed by that curly strand of hair on his forehead, and I was relieved when he finally had a cut somewhere in Korea. <br /> <br /> There was certainly some action - cruel murders, a man's search for a son - and maybe there was even a conspiracy, but one consideration was not enough to figure it out, and two visits I'm afraid I'm out of the question. For one, the score was frightening and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). On the other hand, the seasons changed too abruptly, which made you even more confused about what was going on. Oh, there were some nice shots and if you liked "Friday Evening" with its pleats in heavy curtains and bed sheets, you'll appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise steer clear. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something important. However, the dialogue in a Denis movie is rarely more than five pages, double the space and plenty of edge. In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; It is simply boring in "L'Intrus".
