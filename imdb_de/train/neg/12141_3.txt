... because 99 out of 100 times the producers lied by their teeth (or someone else's) to make you rent or buy their * graciously censored *. <br /> <br /> The Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves once again the truth about this event with the release of "Feeding the Masses", a potentially well-intentioned but completely incompetent and bleak entry into the zombie Genre. Guys, this is not just a low-budget filmmaking, this is a VERY low-budget movie making by a group of people who - I'm sorry, I know they have families who love them - never and never be in diversity in any significant way. This is a baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, people, and not only because it is cheap. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre but I do not blame the actors. They had no direction. They had no direction, because the script was a halfway baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling. The characterization is thin at best, no, thanks to the weak dialogue and the sleepless direction. Did I mention that the script and the direction are pretty lame? You are. There is no drama, no tension, no great moments of character, nothing. The entire premise of government suppression of the media is squandered by "uncompromising commercial breaks" and an undramatic plot that defies rational analysis and clumsily ends in its ridiculous end. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic if the reality of it were obvious everywhere? Why should they give it more than a fleeting attempt? What would they be capable of for more than a day at best for mobile phones with wireless access? Well, if they veiled something, like their own guilt, but "Feeding the Masses" never investigates such possibilities. Instead, it's about absurdity and poorly staged events, digging for laughter and / or meaning. The prayer of his audience will not notice the near total lack of production value beyond the basic film equipment. Has anyone paid in this movie? I hope the actors did that, if only for their time, which they have wasted through blind alleyways like these. At least the techies got a few legitimate work experiences. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will not get much out of "Feeding the Masses". The straight lines are remarkably tame for non budgets of their rank, and there are no unmistakable standards or memorable effects. They are all truly unforgettable. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even garbage like the Aussie stillbirth "Undead" was miles ahead of "Feeding the Masses." Sorry, guys, back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you.
