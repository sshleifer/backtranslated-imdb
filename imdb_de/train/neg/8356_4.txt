As an actor, Peter Fonda is so intentionally so enthusiastic that his lachrymosic lines nullify any irony or humor in dialogue. With Brooke Shields, he trades naughty barbs and not witty punch figures, as if he were a block of wood with receding hair. Even his smaller touches (like touching a nonexistent mustache on his petrified face) make a character less recognizable than an insecure actor led by himself, an insecure filmmaker. In the southwest, around 1950, a poor player (no more than a little cheat) wins an orphaned, supposedly teenage Lolita in a failed poker game; After finding a treasure map in the Grand Canyon that promises gold, the contentious couples turn into prospectors. A few beautiful views and a comical but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a fossilized gorge man are the only compensation for an exhausted comedy drama. The two leads are chased by caricature killers who stop at nothing until they get their hands on the card. Shields is very pretty, but - although the camera loves her pouty, shiny beauty - she has no screen presence (and her thin voice has no reach); Every time she opens her mouth, one tends to either frighten or expropriate. * 1/2 of ****
