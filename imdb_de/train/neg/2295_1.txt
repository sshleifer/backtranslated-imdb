Meaningless boring movie with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Published for a minute on a Thursday in maybe a local movie theater and shunned by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project that seems to have been created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well, Polson has turned into a lame thriller director like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio never seems to be different from other roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's biggest exports on the silver screen. Such roles are big disappointments and films like these are just a waste of talent and time.
