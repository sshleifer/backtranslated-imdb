I was not particularly impressed by this film, which has lackluster music and only takes 40 minutes. Thank god, because I fell asleep. I use time-lapse photography excellently to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, and so on. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi, made 87 minutes in 1983 and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made 1988 1988 90 minutes.
