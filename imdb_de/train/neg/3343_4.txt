Interesting story about a soldier in a war who fails to save the life of a young girl from the enemy, and is persecuted by this event, though he has saved many other imprisoned children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher, led mainly by police patrolling the corridors, bathrooms and even the classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison, and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or principals. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the Soldier / Schoolmaster and decides that he will stop teaching and go to another field. However, the headmaster asks him for a class as a last duty as a teacher. At this point in the movie, hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you have decided to display IT!
