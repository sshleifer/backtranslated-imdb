This movie was a disaster from start to finish. Interviews with Bono and The Edge and the interpreters themselves are interspersed with performances of "The Next Generation of Beautiful Losers". This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who surpasses all others in the film with his imperious and yet gentle presence, his wisdom and his humor. The rest are too busy sanctifying him as Saint Leonard or as Old Testament prophets. Many of the performances are forgotten over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainrights) or mild inferior performances. Only Beth Orton and Anthony came with a bit of reserve within the reach of Leonard's own versions. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are made throughout the film about many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurry camera work, the use of digital delays in some of Leonard Cohen's comments (harder to hear what's said), and a scary, overbearing one Drone among many interview sections (an attempt to add gravitas?). For the real thing, see the 1988 "Songs From The Life Of" documentary produced by the BBC.
