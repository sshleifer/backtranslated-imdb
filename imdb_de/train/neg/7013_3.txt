Unfortunately, this film (54) was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only thing that was good about the picture was "Mike Myers", and it was a pleasure to see them. "Neve Cambpell", although her role was little, she was unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that this movie was missing a good performance from the actors except for one, and that putting the true story into action was a desperate attempt at a good script.
