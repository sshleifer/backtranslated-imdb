It really is not a horrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are first-class actors. Besides, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. I also understand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and get paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend time and money making a movie and then not releasing it for theatergoers. Even if a movie is a flop at the box office, it certainly earns some money. If you're a fan of Keitel or Glenn, borrow the video or watch it on TV, just like me. Granted, the film does not help solve the immigration problem with Mexico, but the experience is well over 90% of the standard TV tariff of today.
