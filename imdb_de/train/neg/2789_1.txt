Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video with very minimal light and terrible drama. Not only that the plot and the screenplay were unhappy. I do not know why this movie was made. I've seen a lot of movies in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me mad. This brought my blood to a boil. The situations were crazy at best. If I did a movie like this, it would have been short. Really, because these backwoodsmen "idjits" would not have been in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of the D.V.D. I am an avid observer of bad cinema. But this movie is practically unsurpassable. I do not mind watching movies on D.V. But if you do that to make the movie entertaining, do not make weary repetitions of superior horror movies (without a Wrong Turn). If you come across this in the rental business, drop by. <br /> <br /> Movies that get really angry get an automatic 1.
