"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, even surpassing the nonsensical "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The Lampoon movie is played in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each showing different actors. The only commonality is the total absence of any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the elusive nude photos are beautiful, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry show off their fortune pretty, in part one and in part two. But her glamorous ideas are unfortunately wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround them, and there is no in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark is the most disgusting of the three. and an unfortunate choice as a completion of this film. Benson plays an eager Beaver, a young policeman who kindly announces his first day at work and is ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical policeman played by Widmark. When these Oil and Water Partners start their first patrol together, we feel a potential release from the movie's past flaws. Perhaps, just maybe, the cynical old-timers will be reformed by the unqualified sense of duty and loyalty of their new partner. Maybe everyone ends up happy. But unfortunately, this movie goes straight to the bathroom, with no salvation, no happy ending, no coherent story. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon goes to the movies", I thought I had already seen it The worst blow that Hollywood could possibly miss. Unfortunately, I had not seen half of it. <br /> <br />
