After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these films were made, for example, by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is stupid for two hours without a story. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoons. It seems Kusturica has been steadily going downhill ever since he started doing life-affirming comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think is great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early movies so much, so it's particularly disappointing to see such a thing. Let's hope his next one will be great.
