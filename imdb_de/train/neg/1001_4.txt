I borrowed that on DVD and feel kind of bad, because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about the DVD comments. It's not a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that desperately wants to make a deep commentary on human nature without realizing that its story is practically a genre. In addition, the theme is somewhat simplified in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often weighs on the faith. I would say it's a movie that you'd find out if you did not have a lot of film / tv / literature / life behind it (to be honest, I've even seen almost the same story in horror comics)). Otherwise his point has been made earlier and more artful. And that brings with it the big problem, namely, that it really does not have much cinematic interest beyond the point. It's a pretty boring movie that puts everything into the idea that the basic story will be shocking, captivating and does not really pay off.
