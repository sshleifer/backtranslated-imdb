The reviewer from Poland needs to be a feminist, because she finds "Young Catherine" for a great movie and historically accurate. Nothing is further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian, for many years I had made an exception on almost every corner with YC, especially with the politically correct portrayal of her as headmistress, which alone brought Russia into dominance. The truth? She was brought to St. Petersburg only as a wife and mother and had to "connect" with the Dvoriane, the boyars and the military to survive. As long as she did not challenge her, she could / was allowed to pursue her cultural desires (fill the Hermitage with art treasures). There is so much evidence that it was not "great," but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit fluffy by Ted Turner, which, like "Peter the Great" (1986), is another example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West.
