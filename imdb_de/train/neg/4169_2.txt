I gave him a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as the vampire Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is little logic in this movie, but so are most sci-fi vampire flicks. The movie has probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There's too much gore and too many rip-off scenes that make me sick. A good vampire movie should be so reasonable that you do not have to see much blood - we all know that when a vampire jumps on a human, he / she will do what a vampire will do. A few grunts or screams are enough to describe the scene (as in the end, when Quintana Rosa wants to arouse sexually, all she needs is a few nagging, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
