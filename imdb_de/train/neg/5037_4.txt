Content = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen and her birthday is coming in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to connect with her, but the few who manage to arouse her interest mysteriously die. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to see this movie is because Dana Kimmel from Friday's The 13th pt 3 was in there, which is not a good reason to watch a movie. When I started to look at it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it's really boring and boring and just goes nowhere. After more than an hour, only three murders have occurred, and the story has not really developed in any way. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot with pretty nice photography and good direction, but just like many other 80's slasher flicks, the movie is sometimes too dark. Actually, the acting is pretty good and Melissa's character is easy to understand, even if she is a complete slut. <br /> <br /> The plot is not completely trash, but it's just too boring to interest you. The only thing that interested me was Melissa, she was stunning and Dana Kimmel, whose really sweet and sweet in this movie. All in all, a rather boring slasher streak that would not go anywhere where I definitely would do it would not be recommended for Slasher fans.
