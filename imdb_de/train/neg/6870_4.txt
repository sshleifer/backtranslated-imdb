A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of the religious Talmud scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). Who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field where she's already a jewelery expert. He also starts having an affair with her, and when she spends time with an artist from Puerto Rico, he drops her and betrays her to the family that excludes her. There is a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is not clear. Unfortunately, many things are not clear, not even what is going on with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe that there is a fire in her and maybe not of God, and what that means and what the magical beggar woman says her means. To a certain extent, history touches the plight of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly free. The idea of ​​being redeemed by the love of a man of another race is also not well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman and yet it is the bastard sender who quotes him as Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the part; She is said to be a Midwestern Jew, and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times she picks up the distinctive sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is tough and takes responsibility, but in the end the movie is a mess.
