I saw an early screening of this movie in New York, and I was very disappointed with my friends and pretty much the entire audience. The movie was not even so bad that it was good; It was as lifeless as a snakebite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired by most and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cheesy sci-fi movies, except that the cheese dairy of this movie was not funny or camping. It all seemed worn, flat and openly formulaic. I'm shocked to say that I think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP recognizes that it is a piece of s * it and plays along with it. But what the film does not do is a script that's afraid of tension. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyless.
