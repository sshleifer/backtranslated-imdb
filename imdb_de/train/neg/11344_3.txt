I was unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but that may be worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like the animation, very Saturday morning cartoon, in some scenes just worse. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was really vicious in the original, but lost in the sequel to quality. What she said was not something to write home about, and her animation was kind of ugly. Even her fellow artist Lars was a joke, to be honest, and Roger seemed to stop smoking overnight. The vocal talents were very good, but especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent has ruined it for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed to be bloated for me, hinting at an extended TV episode. All in all, a most disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s Disney movies along with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give a 3/10, it just was not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
