This is a terrible movie. Yes, the girls are pretty, but it is not very good. The conspiracy of a cowboy with an Indian girl would be interesting if sex were not in the way. Okay, it might be interesting, but it's not because it's so bad and only partially done. I can only imagine the close-ups of the dancing on a big screen, probably more ridiculous than on TV. (I will not even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing from chest to chest - never read about it in the Old West.) This is a movie that requires a liberal use of the fast forward strip <br /> I like the movies, but that's ridiculous. There's a reason why I did not choose this kind of movies and that they are not very good as the plot is behind the breasts. The original bare cuties, as they are called, were originally nudist films or films in which there was no contact. However, as the adult industry began to grow, the filmmakers either tried to be clever, or tried to use something else to bump into the seats. The smart ones were very few, leaving only hacks with limited talent. The comedies were often best expressed. The humor approached first grade, infantile but harmless. Something you can rarely say about another genre dressed up as a noodle. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and has some nice pieces, but he is neither western nor sex movies. <Br /> <br /> I do not need to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, no one was the rapist and murderer in the film by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family, who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming. <br /> <br /> Obviously these things will ruin the lives of some people.
