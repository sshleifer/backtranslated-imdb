Maybe I've seen too many crime strikes, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the clich√© that was most ridden, plotteficient, plott-absurd, just plain stupid movie seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems to take less time to show this than having put it together. <br /> <br /> Actually, it looks like it's going to turn it into a video before it's finished. <br /> <br /> It's a bad distraction from "M", the classic Fritz Lang movie starring Peter Lorre. It would be much better if you rent this instead.
