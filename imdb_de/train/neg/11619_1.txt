I saw the whole movie and waited until something happened. Maybe it's my fault I expected evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange repetition of the Oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother, marry my uncle and compose music theater with him? I did not understand why certain plot elements were even present: why was the build up, why was there such a big staircase with a perfect place for someone who fell into his ruin, if no one really did, why the scenes were with Father at work, why do you have such a nice kitchen, if you just want to eat to go, why would the boy want to be baptized, and the parents have to be aversion instead of the other way around. I see a lot of good reviews for this movie ... Was my taste distorted by B-movies from the 70s and old sci-fi movies?
