This movie should NEVER have been done. From the bad animation to the bad drama. I'm not sure when the people behind the movie said, "Okay, looks good! Let's do it!" I was in awe of how really awful this movie was. At one point, possibly the BAD point, a computer-generated gold saber-tooth falls from the roof, stabbing the idiotic creator of the cats in the mouth ... The villain of the film was a paralyzed Sabretooth killed a few minutes after his first appearance has been. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before they are burned and shot down. Then there is a chance that awaits the victims in the jungle ... which scares me for a single reason. Will there be a second part? God, I do not hope for people everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie was garbage. From the outlet, you'll need to get credits until the slideshow ends.
