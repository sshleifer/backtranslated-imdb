This movie is one reason why IMDB should allow a 0/10 vote. The spectacle is terrible, also what some have praised here, the Carpathia character! The script looks like it was written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher left behind when asked by Buck, which means "dan7" in computer graphics, said, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." He probably meant VERS 24, but the filmmakers overlooked this slip-up. Perhaps the worst thing is that the film's eschatological position is not biblically good. While many Christians have advocated interpreting the film for end-time events, in my opinion this interpretation is flawed. To understand these errors, read "The Christians are getting through the tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, a Biblical Study of the Second Advent and Rapture" by George E. Ladd
