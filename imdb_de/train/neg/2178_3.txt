I would have enjoyed this movie a bit more if Jason (Herb) Evers had not experimented constantly. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of being too busy. But as more and more critics thought the movie was right, they thought it was intentional. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is just that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this B classic were pretty good actors, except for Evers and the showgirls. If you saw this movie, you would have noticed that Evers screamed almost every line until he smoked and blew the smoke coolly from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were normal in a B-movie like this. In hindsight, I do not notice much, which is fantastic good or bad for this movie.
