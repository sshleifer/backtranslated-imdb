Why was this movie made? Even taking into account the generous tax benefits Australian film investors have received, there can be no reasonable explanation that this film will win the contract. For God's sake, the actors in this film are Australian B-class stars (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the band's original drummer in Hey Hey Its Saturday) and the countdown spokesman , But if you say that, it's still very good to see, as long as you give it the brains it deserves: none: the script is bad (even for a well-known b-grade horror) and the acting and movie quality is worse It often looks like it's a home theater, but even a home theater has "realism." Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend that this movie has NEVER been made.
