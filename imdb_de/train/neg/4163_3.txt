I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to explain their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that there were basically excuses - descriptions, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticism of the pivoting is not personally addressed, but only a warning that this does not allow the cut. <br /> <br /> It is observable, but hardly so. There are action holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the end is telegraphed a mile away. The modest intriguing feature of a hologram interacting with a reconnaissance team drowns in stupid dialogues, such as when someone prepares a meal in the midst of an allegedly tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you involve us in the Hamburg Helper Sally, who was killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently, this elite team, equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic-wound wonder armor, has no access to MREs. Once they've arrived in the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly encounter area. <br /> <br /> The reason for meeting the fearsome Rook is that he can not be killed with one hand. But just before a scene, the hero who made this case left King to do just that. Huh Vivian Woo was attractive and undoubtedly the best-played character in the film. But that does not say much.
