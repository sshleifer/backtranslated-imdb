Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B-movies, should warn you about the quality of this movie. This is not a B-movie though. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and the animals - WOW - it's the worst data animation that's been done in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You barely see the SCAAARY Sabretooth on the front. You only hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and you occasionally see teeth or tiger paws. It's so amateurish! Maybee worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen and I'm waiting for your reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is too weak to give it a spoiler alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
