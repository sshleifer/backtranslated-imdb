Today, I agreed on why so many people complain about modern films in which I found a strange statement: "Character development in newer movies is just not nearly as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the films in question, this may be due to a number of things, sometimes to generic special effects and plot-driven Hollywood trash like War Of The Worlds, but in the case of exaggerated, uninteresting attempts, social commentary and a desperate struggle to re-create "art." to bring to the cinema, it's films like Dog Days, which are to blame. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or pointless I am, they (ranging from good, long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville to those that I've found to be painful sitting by the Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I turned off this movie in 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I should have done. I was not interested in any of the characters and found nothing essential except a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. Trying to say something about the backwardness of society, this movie becomes too selfish, banal and exploitative in the truest sense of the word. Granted, I've seen a lot of disturbing films on the same subject, but there are so many better films about depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters with great emotional depth and characters personality. The Dog Days had nothing more than an eighth-grade dislike for society. She chose to ignore any true intelligence about the way in which human beings actually are, and instead a boring, terrible and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a "work of art." This is not a characterization of the unknown or a wise observation in the rubble of society, it is just boring and nothing to worry about.
