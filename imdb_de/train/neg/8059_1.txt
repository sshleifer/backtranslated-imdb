This film is about a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), who leaves her family and goes to college freshman. One night, Cassie and her friends opt for a wild party with lots of drinking and dancing. Cassie rides with her friend she likes, but he never told him she loved him. When Cassie drove, a car in the middle of the street was stopped, and she could not avoid an accident. As a result, a bloody death occurs with her boyfriend. Cassie is very emotionally angry and has nightmares, which is why she has hallucinations because her boyfriend comes back to life and meets men who try to murder her whole cruelty test. Cassie dreams that she is loved by her boyfriend after he dies and finds another man in her bed. He is told that she has asked him to love each other. This is a way out and not good at all.
