The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and their thoughts on their past. The flashbacks are about a weekend when young Ann is in her friend Lila's wedding. At the wedding, she meets Harris, who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, "responsible", mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from friend to friend and from job to job and is not sure which direction she is in life. <br /> <br /> First of all the good. The details in the movie are great. The clothes, hair, cars, houses, etc. put you in another time and place. And in the movie there are some very good plays. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at describing the main character and her fragile mental state when her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as lead actress when she was young (and she is a great singer). Hugh Dancy has brought much life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now for the worse, which unfortunately is everything else. Things are constantly disturbing the story as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between the young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then ... you should believe that she does not really like him more than a friend and that his pinging just annoys her. And I thought the whole thing, "he could be gay," was out of the blue and had no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character looks wooden and scary. Had this been another genre, you would have known that Harris was a serial killer right from the start. It's unbelievable to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they make the other guys look pretty lame to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why do not Ann and Harris get together? They collapse. They have this great night of sex in an old, dirty gardener's hut, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then ... Nothing. A couple of years later and all misty eyes on each other and I could not help wondering why. WHY? The film does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people, so I found it hard to regret it. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is pretty boring. The good daughter of the stereotype and the bad daughter of the stereotype. Nina changes over the course of the movie, but I do not know why. I'm not sure what convinced her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene in which the daughters make a connection that coincides with old Ann, who dreams of chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes," Ann advises. The statement does not sound right with the story. And it does not sound true after watching the movie and wishing he had not wasted the talent of such a good actor.
