I saw this movie in a small screening of members of my college's gaming club. We were warned that this would be the "reefer madness" of games, and this movie was more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who begins his college career after a "rest period" for one year semester. We, the viewer, learn in the course of the film that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters," a game he meets after recruiting a game group for a campaign. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous on many levels. One scene shows the group "Gaming by Candlelight", which is probably the best way I can describe it. I'm sure this should be "cultish" in some way, as most players know, but it's terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing games take place in well-lit rooms, usually with some chee-tohs and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> Acting is not an Oscar, but it's not terribly awful. This is one of Tom Hanks first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two to go. The minor cast is not particularly memorable, but still gives proper performances. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that it's a TV movie that shows the "dangers of the game" to see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
