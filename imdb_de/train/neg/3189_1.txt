I think that shows that Joe Don Baker will do everything for a bit of money. The concept of the film was not very good in the beginning. This movie has so many bad things that I do not know where to start. The spectacle is terrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie landed on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote that, and I can not believe that 9 people thought this movie was excellent. You must have liked the two go-go dancers. The last justice would be if they lock up that stinker in the movie hall outside Wichita and never let anyone see again! A rating of 1 in 10 is way better than it deserves.
