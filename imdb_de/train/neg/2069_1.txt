I watched the theater at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, Ohio, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would be a more believable boxer. <br /> <br /> As It was painful in a movie, but to see Bret Carr in person was desperation on his peak. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was to see BC hit in the face with a "C". Battery. The jury is not yet there. It was from a dildo and it was in slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Just shoot the left side of the face ... people become famous when they demand things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr dressed in a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology and roamed the streets of Clifton to batter his own movie. He should. This is right to beat the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt hurt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult or smart enough about this matter. That's the feeling you get from the brainwashing Bleepesque trickle, impressive neo-yuppies that got to see this Bret Carr play. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionally exhausting experience just thinking about writing about this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> - Anonymous
