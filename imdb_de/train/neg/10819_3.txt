I agree with one of the other commentators on good story and good actors, who disagree, and I would say it's quick. It's been about 24 years since I read the book the way it was at school. But I felt like you had to get to know the story of Jane Eyre, if you look at it here, if parts are left out, and that's why it makes no sense. For example, Jane and Mr Rochester have barely spoken and suddenly he proposes the marriage !!! The actors have no time to let the audience know how their character feels about every event in the story. The actors are good, but they do not have enough time to do justice to this story. I'm sorry to say, but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970s version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference, BUT you should watch the 1983 BBC mini-version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles. I love it so much that I see it regularly. There is a shortened version for 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
