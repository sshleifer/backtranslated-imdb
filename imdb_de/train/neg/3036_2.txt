This movie was absolutely scary! I can not understand how this movie came to production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, this is the fault of the writing team. You take the old average action - let's dance from poor and destitute circumstances - or STEP in this case. This, however, lacks the appearance of a real conspiracy - or at least one that would interest someone. With Canadian-speaking actors in an American environment - this movie is very flat. On the positive side, the direction was good and the cinematography was pretty decent. Looks like the production budget was also very generous. My only request is that this team leaves the writing alone and seeks real scriptwriters to help them bring words to life. Net result - how she moves as she sucks.
