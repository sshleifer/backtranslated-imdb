I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a couple of times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there was Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some kind of talent, but here they were all that basically adds up to a Cinemax style skin strip Set aboard a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, "Alien Intruder" tries to be unique with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call it Ariel (Scoggins) this kind of high tech Infiltrating virtual reality station aboard a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies while their captain (Williams) surveys the system. <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but this is all a well-padded episode of "Red Shoe Diaries." Williams teaches everything right and left and looks like he would otherwise go somewhere else. Ah, the things people do for money ... <br /> <br /> The FX are pretty static, maybe even less, than you would expect from a low-budget favorite like this one. Unfortunately, even female nudity is lower than expected. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star and of course it gets ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that is just fun and has no mind, look at "Alien Intruder". Of course you do not have to search Cinemax in the morning at two or three in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, not even for the star power this band can muster. <br /> <br /> Let this be lost in the room.
