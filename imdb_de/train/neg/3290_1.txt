This movie is shit! They took something from my childhood and raped in an outhouse! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and hold my "dukes" DVDs and cry in a corner. The cast was terrible! It was not "The Dukes," it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They were never! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse Pot smoke? He never did it! Do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little Chiba, but there was no room in this movie! The only good thing about this movie was the trailer before the movie and the credits. It was a waste of time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
