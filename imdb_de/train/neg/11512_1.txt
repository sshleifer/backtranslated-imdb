*** WARNING! HERE CONTAINED SPOILER! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what could happen to Madonna if she were ever stranded on a desert island. There is absolutely no challenge for Madonna in this role, and that shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna and she can not even do that right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know that Madonna really is like that, you never met her!" Right, I do not have, but we all remember "Truth or Duty", right? I know Kevin Costner does that. <br /> <br /> One might think that in 2002, Madonna got screened by the "crossover" ladies who have also made their way across the street, either way. For God's sake, has not Madonna seen "glitter"? Mariah Carey has shown the movie world HOW IT WILL !!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy ass in terms of beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization on the roadside. All we can see from that look in Madonna's world is that she's the only one in this world. <br /> <br /> If there is something for Madonna to say, then she is consistent. As an MTV favorite, she has set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in the movie, she has reset the roles of women in Film AND Society 20 years ago by enchanting all the hated, frightful, reprehensible, and abhorrent features women supposedly imprisoned in them, traits they've so desperately tried prove that they really do not own. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ARE THE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> Here's the good thing I'm going to say about this movie, and I was really impressed. They did not opt ​​for "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her boring, oppressed, flogged husband could have finally settled down with a good, decent wife, a woman just the opposite of his deceased wife, and both live happily ever after. But in this most oppressive conclusion, she is saved, and this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled by his demon of a woman, and his life will again become a hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE THE SPOILER FINDS ***
