Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign movie about black, gay aliens exploring the galaxy until they come to earth. Since they are gay, they want to have a universe in which all people are gay. So when they discover women or "female creatures" living on the earth, they are initially scared; Finally, they decide to eliminate all women on earth and liberate the male population. An offensive title with a racist, homophobic, and sexist plot, though probably intended as a satire, gives this film a shock. Below that, however, is little substance. As another reviewer noted, there are only a few jokes apart from the characters' names (eg ArmInAss). I think I once laughed at a little gay joke. I think I quickly understood the meaning of the film, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I always wanted the movie to end (and it's a short film!). Not brilliant or very well written.
