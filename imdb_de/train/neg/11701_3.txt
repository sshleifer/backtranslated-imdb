Another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be turned into films. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer who is always on a diet and who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy. With the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets out in court, although the accident was a kind of mistake because he was not careful while driving. The father of the dead gypsy curses the 3, with our main character Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner day by day. Although the film was largely held together with the book and your typical king is over, the acting was stilted and felt forced. We went from one scene to another without much of them, like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo appearance in the movie (like Dave Barry), reinforcing my belief that writers should stay that way: writers. Leave the acting to the actors. Not that anyone was so great in this movie. I have seen the main characters in movies where they were much better.
