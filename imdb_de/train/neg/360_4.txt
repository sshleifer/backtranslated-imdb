I read the book and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. Above all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 year old woman. The late Christopher Reeve was another reason. According to the book, Will was about 30 years old. I would like to have researched a bit more about his military life. His friend Red, Elly's journey to see him, since this was an important part of the development of the characters. Miss Beasley was also a failure when the book called her Plus Size Lady. I know the movie did not have the budget of "Bridges Of Madison County", which I believe was released at about the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this was a very bad, bad Miscast movie. As someone mentioned, I wish Miss Spenser retires and writes scripts for her books as it should. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she would consider casting as well. The movie let me down!
