Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier and Mike Mitchell. A hot yuppie who was released by his girlfriend does not want to be left alone for Christmas, so he decides to return to his adolescent home. He forces the dysfunctional family that now lives there and captivates them as his family. A heinous and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, which is primarily a flashy smile, makes his character seem like a spiritually unbalanced shiver, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara bring this chaos to life. Even for the farce, stupidity is bleak, it does not make much sense from scene to scene, and her sentimental messages are as fake as Affleck's grin. 91 minutes, rated with PG-13. * Â½
