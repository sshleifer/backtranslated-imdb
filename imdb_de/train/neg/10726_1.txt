I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the film is pretty good, and you have to get over what's coming ....... which is nothing. All open storylines remain open; Two characters who at first glance looked as if they were significant are completely ignored, except for one or two very short scenes. I walk away if Ilya did not do it better, just let her go ... As for the remaining character, there's nothing to do with her. She's just visiting a dreadful place, and suddenly the movie is not about her anymore, but about some geriatric witches spending their days making bread dolls, drinking homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. Some may say that the film shows a crumbling society, like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camerawork, a lousy script and a terrible bad direction. Therefore, I can not be as generous as my predecessor in the classification: 1!
