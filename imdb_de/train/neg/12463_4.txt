OK, Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Of course I am lying because it is so. I am a conservative but I will leave politics out of my view of the film. This movie was anti-Bush, anti-Middle East, anti-big-money propaganda, but that was not why he was bad. Fist away I will give credit where credit is due. I have seen this movie Opening Night because I like this kind of movies and am a political scientist in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as I could tell very well. <br /> <br /> The plot, however, was impossible for me to decipher. I was tested and I have an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way to assemble the plot of the movie and what characters did. <br /> <br /> The story and scene sequence was completely incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> If this is not one of the films to be viewed many times to get the full depth of the story, which can be very good, I have no idea exactly what was going on. <br /> <br /> Which makes sense, because if you have a political argument and do not want to receive criticism, you can not make your argument for criticism! If you can not dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with Bull S.
