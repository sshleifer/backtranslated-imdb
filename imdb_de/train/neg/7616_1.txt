The good news is that a movie was made based on an alleged Aztec myth, occupying an uncommonly Aztec American woman (such a word exists). The bad news is, it was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood had retired and George Romaro had trained through his classic "Night of the Living Dead," we could imagine that. "The Legend of Diablo" is clearly a breeding ground for future resurrections of "Mystery Science Theater 3000!". <br /> <br /> I do not think you can even call this a "B" movie. The production values ​​are so miserable that I always get the feeling that I'm watching either a long sketch of a variety show or a backyard 8mm movie shot by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The baseline of the plot sounded interesting enough to tempt me to rent them. A rural California sheriff finds a box of an Aztec demon and inadvertently releases it to the unsuspecting community. His daughters, a hot and a cozy, work together with a gringo FBI man and a priest to try to rebuild the demon. <br /> <br /> Every zombie scene you've seen in previous undead movies has been re-enacted. These zombies are more like an army of crazy professors than the undead! The supposed infrared scenes from the perspective of the demon are nothing special? and he / she / it sure seems to secure a lot (instead of turning around). And the scene in which the priest lures the demon out of the cave in quick motion is ridiculous! It really seems to be done for the comic effect - although I know it was not! I've always expected the Benny Hill theme music to start playing and the whole zombie gang chasing the priest all over the beach! Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, which calls the FBI agent is downright weird. And then most of this cheese ball was like that! Robert Napton, director and writer of the script, should win something for this effort! (How about a lifelong blackballing, like the 'Hollywood 10?') This one, as I see now, is rated at 1.5 on a 10-scale. I'm afraid that could be something generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the dead sheriff's younger daughter. Probably her older sister (Calvi Pabon) has really run away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who played for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have stayed at baseball. In fact, they could not have done anything worse if they had dealt with a baseball theme and called it "Demons in the Outfield." <br /> <br /> If I find out that this was actually a project for a community college cinema class, I'll apologize. It could be good enough for a B or even B +, as long as the gang brought the college camcorder back to campus in one go! 'The Blair Witch Project' has proven that a cool Campy movie can be shot with little effort. However, "The Legend of Diablo" did not seem to have light footwear to work from! It was low-budget, low-talent, low-all. The last scene - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the movie - is the ONLY mild creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 for the rental. I could have spent it better for a hamburger!
