If this is based on the true life relationship between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am thrilled, I do not know her personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take dumb pills throughout the movie as the title song is played down the floor. Many stupid scenes with stupid-looking people do not make a comedy.
