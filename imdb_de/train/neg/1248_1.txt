This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting. It was a kind of remake, but not really. I was very disappointed with the tools Tim Burton has available. He had great make-up and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie that was made for less than $ 6 million? Crap no. In that respect, the film fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the Statue of Liberty scene was shocking, but in this film, even in the final scene, there was nothing shocking because you could see it coming somehow. By the way, if you think about it, and I did, you can figure out how the end could come about. I just wish I had the time back when I thought about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been brilliant and funny if it kept the sense of the first movie and took over part of "Beneath the Planet of" the monkeys. "That's how I would have written it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (it should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to handle a movie alone, so I would have included three guys) would end up on a planet that they believe that it would be another planet, encountering people (not mute), a monkey-ridden city, hunted, made friends with good monkeys, discovering that they are on Earth, finding ruined ruins, in the end, when you get up Crazy mutant humans who live underground will start a war between the mutant humans and the monkeys, and then ... Well, let your imagination run wild as you wish to end it. <br /> <br / > My point, though, is that this movie could have been so much more k Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to ruin a good cause. Think about what he did with the Batman series. He is a corrupt director, what people think. He's trendy, so he has to be good when you think. Sorry, but no. If someone else had made this film, it would have been much better and would have been much more satisfying.
