This Worldwide was the cheap version of what the NWA did under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s on the localized "Big 3" stations during Saturday Morning / Afternoon Wrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got Crockett's failed version of NWA in his hands, he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and dropped all NWA credentials. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were renamed the WCW logo and moved from the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, eventually becoming nothing more than WCW's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night replay shows. The world's last WCW program under Turner was officially aired on the weekend of the WCW buyout by Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire NWA / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Library, along with the entire NWA / WCW video tape library, was generally located in the vaults of WWE's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
