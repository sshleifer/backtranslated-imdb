Well, it's Robin Hood as 'Geezer' alright ... just as announced! That did not sound very hopeful and unfortunately it was worse than I had suspected. <br /> <br /> A shabby Robin I can take; a Robin who gets involved with the daughter of a pert-dye manufacturer I can recognize; But a Robin who does not trade witty banter with his only henchman is harder to swallow, and a Robin and his entire cast, who have difficulty handling their lines, are the kiss of fate. How could anyone pass such a laborious delivery without turning the scenes again? Again and again Much sounds like he's fighting half-understood Shakespeare instead of letting go of a salty joke; I initially hoped that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character that was clearly meant for the role of comedy buddy, but then it spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> What else you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the talent to lead dialogues at the highest level as naturally as if he had thought it up spontaneously ... and how this production shows , that's not so easy noises! If they were to cast the characters as cheeky chappies, the actors in question would have been given lines: they sounded as if they had no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I did not like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason. The lines are clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but are handed over to the public with a push and a wink (and written in this case). They are anything but right - quarter-finals, but not really funny. <br /> <br /> This promising production reminded me of a limping school piece. The only actor and character I ever appreciated was the one who played Guy of Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have (a) credible villainy and (b) credible characterization - but honestly, I would not I did not say that this was a very bright future for the future of the series! At the time of writing, I'll try again, hoping that things will improve a little bit in the next week and fall asleep a bit, with fewer scenes of scenes being needed, and perhaps the actors might be comfortable with the dialogue: after all, The first episode of "Doctor Who" was not exactly a showstopper, though it was not nearly so bad. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid that the series almost certainly lost a viewer. <br /> <br /> What a pity, because I have a penchant for "Robin Hood" "legend on the screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the solid reliability of Richard Greene, but this Robin can not take my blood stir in the least.
