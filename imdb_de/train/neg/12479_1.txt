DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans. In this almost 80-minute travesty of filmmaking everything is offered what Heckler can wish - not plotting, terrible drama (except for a rough-sounding old lady), ridiculous scripting and Schlock-editing and background in Bargain-Keller-style the settings. There are no characters that are likeable or interesting (in particular, the lead is not attractive) and the assembled actors do little to get beyond F-class material. If that's not enough, how about the lack of a compelling storyline (which this movie does not have) to make DEATHSTALKER a big turkey? I was also offended that women in this film have little other purpose than 1) to be topless and / or sparsely clothed; 2) to be raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) All the above. Besides, the background music is disgusting; a bizarre jumble of electronic noise, cheesy choir chants and bubbling orchestral cacophony. Stunning the ear and numbing the eye, all packed in with nothing to arouse interest, the DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for people looking for something to laugh about (and believe me, there's plenty of it ). Otherwise I recommend this 100th CONAN-Wanna-no one in the least.
