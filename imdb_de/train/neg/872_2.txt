At first, I expected "Caged Heat" to look in the same direction as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In no case is this movie from the 70s exploited, "Chix in Chains" or "Women in Prison". Sure, the plot consists of a group of women in jail, by the way wearing street clothes (pretty weird), but NOTHING's doctor is going to flee and no inmates are out. There are two shower scenes that I suspect are recycled material, but there are no fights / nobody gets seduced here - or anywhere else! Apart from the lack of conspiracy, unconvincing, disagreeable and flat characters, a few inmates who actually manage to escape actually return to jail to "liberate" their fellow inmates. !! PUH-LEASE, the film should have just ended with the outliers riding into the sunset ... as opposed to the chaos going on! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
