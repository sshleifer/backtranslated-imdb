I recorded these here because the music was done by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix Modularsynths (by someone I love). The art of the jacket says "the version of 2003". <br /> <br /> I give a point for a strong woman, a point for a dialogue and a last point for Meg Foster's pale blue eyes, many of which are shots of. <br /> <br /> It was fun to swim David MacCullum by chance (the pool has a Plexiglas window!), while his sweetheart was chased by a psycho in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were a little impressive - that is, the houses of the rich people in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was located. I wondered how they could continue cleaning with all the dust. The wind was not strong enough to be credible to me. I always thought that the animal skins on the furniture had to be disgusting ... etc. and realized that the movie must be pretty boring when I wonder about these things when the supposed plot unfolded. I stumbled upon things, why did she light a fire, blow the match and throw the match into the fire ?! That stupid stuff. It was clunky at best. Well. Robert Morely had some fun with his crazy Geezer character and a great holiday.
