The "Trivia" site on IMDb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re-edited by the studio to "simplify the conspiracy." If so, this effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I've ever seen in a movie - I'd hate to have seen it before the plot was "simplified". <br /> <It's sad to see Warren with so little character that he can not even handle the inappropriate material. It's interesting to see Caron in the 70's style rather than in her glamorous garb and personality from the Hollywood era, but it's sad to see how she was saddened by the filth that had befallen her husband and wife. Producer Husband equals, wandered through. She would actually meet and marry the director later. Instead, as you know, he never directed again, but from the beginning worked only the first or second offspring on TV. That should tell you enough. <br /> <br /> I call that "interesting" because I have an automatic preference for American films of that time and that role Oates's otherwise fantastic 1971 output (Two Lane Lane, The Hired Hand). But the "detective of the 1940s as a fish-out-of-water in the 1970s L.A." Theme, that's the only thing the movie really has to say is sold way too hard. A similar topic would be much more effective two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. And when Oates played a hard-core guy on a damn job three years later, he gave his final performance in Bring Me, the head of Alfredo Garcia. If you have not seen them yet, do not waste time with them!
