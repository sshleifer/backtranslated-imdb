Russell Hopton played in many movies until his death in 1945. He only directed and "Black Gold" was one (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes rough screen presence, but he played a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the "quickie" circuit - he made so many films. In this he plays the son of an old oilman, who is convinced that he will beat oil very soon. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to persuade the old man to sell himself because he knows that oil will be put on at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes on stage and helps Daddy's "Fishtails". He convinces Fishtail to go to school regularly. Henry keeps an eye on Cynthia, the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she had started her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail's" father is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to convince Fishtail to sell his oil lease. Everything ends well when oil is beaten and "Fishtail" goes to military school. <br /> <br /> It's okay for a rainy day.
