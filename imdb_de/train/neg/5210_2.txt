Let me be honest first. I did not see the whole movie I looked at the first five minutes and when I realized I was almost asleep, I decided that maybe I could fast forward and see if it got interesting later ... It did not work. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to turn a story that is already uninteresting and badly narrated into something it would never become: a decent horror movie. I think it's important to say that even a movie with bad special effects can still be good if it's done well. This movie will not put you in a deep sleep when you try to look at it. I think it's important to say that this movie is in the public eye. If you feel that you need to look at it, a search on the internet will surely show you a place where you do not have to pay for it heap of movie crap.
