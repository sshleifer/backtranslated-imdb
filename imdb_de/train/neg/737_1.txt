WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from a friend of mine who bought it at Walmart for 1.98 and he feels he was taken! It's not boring, most of the scenes are shot in front of a green screen, the acting is a bit improvised, almost as if they have no script. The Martians are CGI who look as if they were made by a beginner or a fan-produced movie. I can not stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, Martians torture a local prisoner. She walks from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of this woman. The change is palpable, and when she's killed you can tell she's a computer character that looks like something out of a 1990 game! Pest! You can download two trailers from their website and see how awful it really is!
