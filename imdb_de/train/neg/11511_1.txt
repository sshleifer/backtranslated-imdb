I was fortunate to see this movie at a show in the USA. I reluctantly sat through the whole horrible thing and am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fitted in with this thing in the early seventies after the 1969 revolution; this movie just smells like ... nothing, really nothing. It is so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cheap perfume commercial - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna could never act and was embarrassed on the big screen for years. With each of these years, she looks increasingly bad and resembles more and more a skinned meerkat. Guy Ritchie, who built his reputation on Lock Stock, never could - his films are flat, poorly cut fashion shows. He does not disappoint here either; He knowingly chose his wife as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please, folks, pay attention to the good reviews this movie has received from other posters. They are obviously business operations. Do not encourage Ritchie to continue humiliating yourself by giving him money. <br /> <br />
