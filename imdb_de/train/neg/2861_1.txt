I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never got better. Acting, the music drowns out the actors. Dreadful. Save your money! They have to read the film through and through, because they knew that the music drowned out the spoken lines. I never got the role of the slaughterhouse or the need to keep slaughtering cows and pigs. What had that to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors in this movie. The script would have dismissed me on the first read page. It would be better if you see the paint dry.
