... but the problem with this production is that it is far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Granted, one can not always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; Still, the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber funny. It's deadly boring and uninspiring (with one or two exceptions) and shortly after I saw it, I could not remember a single major tune - which is pretty tragic, as someone who's listening to the entire Another Hundred People of three <br /> It's also strangely un-theatrical. It takes place on an unbelievably big stage (you really have to feel sorry for the people in the front row who have broken their necks to see something happen 50 yards to the right or 100 yards to the left) and does absolutely nothing with them. If one person is to sing on stage, you get exactly that - and the rest of the stage is empty. For me as an aspiring theater director, it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact is, Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture better in his works than these talents ever can. And I am confused about the popularity of this legendary musical.
