The 3-D series in "The Man Who Was Not There" is for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This incompetent comedy has lousy 3-D effects that make the 3-D effects look better in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3". Not to mention that the movie is extreme. This was one of many 1983 films showing pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were locked up in this mess, but at least they did not kill their careers. Tambor then starred in HBO's The Larry Sanders Show and Ron Howard's box-office hit How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while Guttenberg followed the flop with Police Academy and Cocoon. What they did in these projects instead of them here in "The man who was not there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
