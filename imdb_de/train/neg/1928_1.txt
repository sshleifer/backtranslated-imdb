As the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that everyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this movie? It was also a bit strange that Jim Carrey was the Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedic actor, but he's a Grinch? It just did not make sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and at moments unintentionally ridiculous. Not to mention that some of the added dialogues were a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over and was not needed. You just destroyed the story, period. <br /> <br /> All who are in Whoville are preparing for the best Christmas season, when everything should run perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch who lives above them, and that he does not get as good at Christmas as the other one. He kicked her out and decided he did not want Christmas this year and that he was supposed to steal only Christmas to show who his Christmas version is. But soon he realizes that the Who knows that it is a bit more than the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> How the Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend sticking to the cartoon just because this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the entire movie was a bit over, not to mention how the Grinch stole Christmas! was meant as a cartoon rather than a version with Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version, which is played for Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
