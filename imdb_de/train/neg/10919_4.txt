Bollywood fans value Amitabh Bachan's Mard quite a bit, but I think that's very overrated. Manmohan Desai previously worked in films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie. I saw everyone I liked, so I had very high expectations before seeing Mard and was sorely disappointed. My main point of criticism with Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony, Part 2, maybe Mr. Desai had no ideas, after all, he had used that formula for years. 1. First, some members of the AAA cast are being repeated, such as the police inspector, Amar, the Muslim, Akbar, Nirupa Roy, and others. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses her sight, in Mard she loses her voice. 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi whale sai baba), and in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. After seeing AAA over 1000 times, I noticed it immediately. <br /> <br /> My other problems are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous. Manmohan Desai made it impossible for you to leave your brain with the kind of movies, but with Mard I thought he had gone too far. My last point of criticism is that I found the songs rather disappointing compared to earlier Manmohan Desai films. I know there are many fans who swear by it, but I did not like it a bit. It really hurts me to write this review because I'm such a big fan and loved his movies since I was a kid.
