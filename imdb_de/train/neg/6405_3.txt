No real conspiracy, just a row of short skits playing some VERY old jokes. I chuckled once or twice at the beginning, much to my annoyance. But after just 73 minutes, this movie has not been used for a long time and becomes boring and boring (with a bit of nudity scattered here and there to keep you awake). As bad as this movie is (and that's pretty lazy), it's a comedic gem compared to ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this movie ; and followers for Beyond the Door, Dead Pit, The Farmer, Possessed, Power Play, Sole Survivor, and Wacky Taxi
