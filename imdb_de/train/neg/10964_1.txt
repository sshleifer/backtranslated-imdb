I had the misfortune to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The entire sidewalk was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. As an avid fan of Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books, I was very much looking forward to the premiere of this movie, which made watching just more uncomfortable. Usually, I am passionate about modern retellings if they are treated well. As a rule, it is interesting to see the parallels between past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was less of a modern retelling than a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the characters of the original seemed youthful and proved to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most performances were ridiculously exaggerated, probably due to a bad direction or the effort to make up for a bad script. I did not even laugh during the entire duration of the movie. All jokes were outdated clues to not so current events that will surely lose their meaning over time. The only highlight of the movie was really the opening sequence in which the White Rabbit is on the way to Alice, but even then the result was a bad imitation of Danny Elfman's work. I also have to say that converting the croquet game into a rave dance-off was terrible. It was undoubtedly the low point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not see this movie After graduating, I was really angry.
