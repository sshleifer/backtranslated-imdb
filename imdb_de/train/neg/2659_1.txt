I'm sorry, but that's just terrible. I've been telling people about this movie and the bad acting that's in it, and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea that modern Japanese troops are being retreated to the time of the Busido warriors and are suitable for almost anything with their modern weapons. When the troops realize for the first time that something strange is happening, every single person in the back of the transport has to say, "Hey, my watch stopped?" Imagine lines that repeat themselves at least fifteen times before they say otherwise, and you have pinpointed the lack of size of the movie.
