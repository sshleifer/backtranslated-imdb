A former reviewer called this movie "pure visual pleasure". I wonder if he / she saw the same movie I made. "High Art" had to have the relentlessly depressing interior since "Seven". You can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell's clich√© for going to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before doing so, one must watch opium den parties being inhabited by people who are obviously out of work but somehow support a thriving drug habit. Not to mention the icy glances of these familiar movie types, the girlfriend / boyfriend at startup, who know they'll be thrown sometime in the next 100 minutes. The film also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years. What did she do when she retired at the age of 20?
