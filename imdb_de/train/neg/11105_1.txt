It was pointless and it was so horrible ... I think Hollywood has so much movie ... you have not seen it. People cutter or eater what can I say ... it made me sick! Oh dear God! The film is about people we do not know but who feed on humans! you have teeth blah blah blah ... is not it known? I bet you saw it in another movie. The cast was so great, but I think scenario was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was totally fantastic ... he's so talented ... actually I said awful, but I think it's because of horrible scenes ... let me explain. Did you ever eat tongue? but there was one in the movie! it was really awful ... but I think the movie would be so good without those terrible human eating or milling scenes ...
