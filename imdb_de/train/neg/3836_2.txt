As one of the few commentators who did not see the first movie, I found this movie very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has a funny kind of humor, if you can stand it (high). morally dubious condition. In the important areas, however, it fails insanely. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and nonsensical act involving Gordon Sinclair's generous friend, possibly involved in a plot to potentially provide third world countries with dangerous electronics in free computers ... or maybe not. Vague, lengthy and inconclusive. The absence of an essential end is so annoying and the existing is pompous and utterly illogical. The film feels half finished. <br /> <br /> Suspending unbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) attracted to Gordon Sinclair's inconspicuous character, especially as he fights off her progress. Ridiculous. Later in the film, it gets worse when he reaches his romantic ambitions and then abandons all ideals based on unclear evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies make me feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
