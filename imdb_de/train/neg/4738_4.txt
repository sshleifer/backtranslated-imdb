I loved seeing the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, captivating storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura Rock!), Editing and not forgetting the beautiful Aya Ueto that filled the part perfectly. I was looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it, I felt I had won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however The pace is much slower, the action is not so exciting and choreographed, and there is not much character development that was obviously led by the same man who further reduced the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other reviewers of the past who say this was a missed opportunity If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment, there are some beautiful Japanese forest landscapes that you can view while the slow Action unfolded and we are presented too briefly A bit of characters being killed off quickly Even the real bad guys get too easily without a lot of fighting The fight with the Spider-type (right out of an episode of Monkey!) in the Bamboo Forest was all about the memorable battle scene. In Azumi 1 we had a martial battle scene with keg camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi Cape Cam !! Azumi's killing spree at the end was unconvincing, but Aya is still doing a good job. She looks great in the cape ... but where did she get it from? I do not think I'll see that again and again! ...what a shame.
