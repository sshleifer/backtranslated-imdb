I did not expect much from this movie, but boy, I did not expect the movie to be that bad. Chris Rock does not show a good act here. You can not get the feeling that his character is real. I think the movie would have been a little bit better if it was about dramas or romantic scenes that were less part of the movie and more / better humor was involved. The film is as if the filmmakers had a bad hangover. In the "Making of" they do not show a single smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave it three out of ten because of the little smile it gave me, but I never laughed!
