This is only the second time that I have stopped halfway a video / DVD. <br /> <br /> I was ready to give this film the benefit of the doubt, even though it was flat as well as clich√©d, stupid ... AND joyless, tedious and overbearing. <br /> <br /> It was like an after school special, led by that weird nine-year-old kid who thinks no one understands him ... scary and sad, and the voice-over story is just the most deceptive Teenagers would consider poetry ... and some singing, and ... no, really, the poor child's suffering ... Enough, when it turns into a brazen, awkward and offensive clockwork orange rip-off. And did I mention the vocals? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt least compelled to sit through. I can not recommend it to anyone.
