Let me first say that this is not the movie for people who want to see something spiritual and happy for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal and just depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a schmoozy mother who is down at Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they lose their house, can not buy Christmas gifts for the kids, etc. They get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. So comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas Angel, who in his dark hat and long coat looks more like a pedophile who walks around with children all day watching them. What better way to teach Mary Steenburgen the Christmas spirit than kill her family and then offer to bring her back when she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for refugee Nazis fleeing. The movie is so thick that you're not interested in the happy ending when it comes, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this movie was a bit Capra-like, but it left out the joy and the feeling of what a holiday movie should be like.
