A really scary movie. It feels like a straight person in the early 1990s who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, up-and-coming mainstream people. LTR is regressive to insulting and suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvage sad, lonely, sex-crazy gays. Impressive! Who knew? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the sinister buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fagot, etc.) and the main characters are milkshot, middle-class, middle-breast clones, of little interest. <br /> <br There is not much to say about the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple: we have seen everything before and done a lot better.
