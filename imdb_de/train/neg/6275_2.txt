Very unnecessary movie with characters that behave so unsympathetic that I really did not care who would do it the best (or was that the purpose of the movie to show some smooth, cold-hearted New York City people?) No comedy either. Acting is very shallow and a very predictable storyline. What annoyed me the most was this constant joke with quotes from classic movies. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original! A small budget is no excuse, even the first-time director. Shit, shit, shit. No wonder it only cost me a dollar ...
