I remember when this came out, many kids were crazy about it. I guess I was a bit too old to get excited, and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and always found it a bit cheesy. In the early '90s we were overcrowded with programs like this, giving children the feeling that they could fight and be a power ranger, or be equal to these children on three ninjas. I think parents and filmmakers were sick and tired of it, because in reality we only had a few kids stamping and punching everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's films have something big to offer, and it's nice for your kids to see and receive the message, this message has no message whatsoever. It uses only a million differences in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have much visual quality, but would you expect that? Acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but embarrassed to see him here. The short, fat, ruffled old fart as a powerful ninja who was just funny. The kids played way too much and the youngest Ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen. The film has an action that everyone knows before reading the review. 3 Ninjas ... yeah, you know they're going to fight some bad guys and obviously win ... I have to say more. I'm sorry if I spoiled it for everyone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, KIDS WILL LOVE IT. This movie is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you do not mind seeing your child watching movies about fighting kids, this is a good movie to show. If you do not mind seeing your kids throw away all the trash that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality time, you've found a movie for your kids ... I'm telling kids because I think even the girls do I like it ... I remember all the girls who have a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults ... this movie Big Time Failed .. It's more than cheesy and nothing Original or unique and I would not allow a child of mine to see it ... Kung Fu, the TV series is on DVD and there are a lot of great Shaw Brothers films out there. Why not show your children things that really entertain them, and do not mute them on the way, maybe even teach them some moves, not just how to kick a man between his legs like grandpa did on 3 ninjas. .. no no no ... never kick a man in the legs ... never .. that's so unninja like.
