Of the three titles by Jess Franco that find their way into the Official DPP Video Nasty List (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least-deserving celebrity, as it is a dreadfully boring jungle club Little of one revives little inept gore, a superfluous rape scene, and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> The beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of reckless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by an inhabited island, a savage tribe that calls the "Devil God "Worshiped in the jungle (a tall, naked, naked look that likes to eat the hearts of naked female victims). <br /> <br /> Employed at Laura's Agent A $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnamese vet go to the island, but there's trouble when the bad guys try a double cross , During the confusion, Laura flees into the jungle, but gets straight into the arms of the natives of the island, which she offers to her God. Franco, in his usual torpid style, directs this ridiculous effort with his usual dreadful hallmarks: crap, sombre cinematography, fast zooming, lots of step footage, blurry pictures, horrible sound effects, and garbage editing. The result is a terrible mess that is a real struggle to get through from start to finish (it took me a few sessions to finish it), and even the sight of the lush bookboy in all its natural splendor is not enough for me to see this movie in a hurry.
