Well, the Artyfartyrati of Cannes may have liked this movie, but I'm afraid not me. If you like the kind of movie where the recordings linger so long that you wonder if the actor fell asleep or the cameraman went to lunch, this may be the case for you. Much of it is so with short stays in the area of ​​inconvenience. I did not find it shocking or disturbing like some other reviewers - just a little uncomfortable and pointless. The only reason I did not give this star is that acting is commendable and the movie is filmed pretty well. The plot, however, has little to recommend. Much of the film shows only a grumpy woman teaching piano or hearing what some people might address. But in case you think this is harmless enough, prepare yourself for some snippets of pornography and sexual violence, just to awaken you with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
