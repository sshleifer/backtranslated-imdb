TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In the late 19th century in England the young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school in Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and defies the school's school seal, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of numerous screen adjustments - especially Gordon Parry's towering 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel is being handled in the early 21st century, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV "Where the Heart Is") ) and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is pleasant and observable, but also more relaxed and boring. Only through Fry's sincere performance as the new director determined to take some of the school's most dubious "traditions" with him, and by introducing a potential new star in 14 The young pettyfer, a talented boy with an effortless charm and vivid look, that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is a typical British TV feed favored by executives who want to fill the schedules with "prestige" products, even if it is a totally unobtrusive product. The British publication "Radio Times" described it as "stupid and strange" and raised a disturbing eyebrow at all this dizziness and brutality and a handsome, predatory villain who tormented the lives of sweet little boys. Quite.
