Many people like to refer to this TV movie when they quarrel with Hanks-Philes' huge legions about how Tom actually made shitty films (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons-like game" that finally drives our young Gump into hallucinatory madness. The story is charming from the early eighties and focuses on the immediate threat to our youth from these evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer "Mazes and Monsters" as a turn point in "Whatever happened to Chris Makepeace?" History. We all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the hapless Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by knocking out Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who regularly read "Dynamite!") That great things were in store for him. <br /> <br /> And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad drama and bad writing is very poor. I leave it up to you to decide whose debt Makepeace wears here. All I know is that the last big release in which I saw him was "Vamp," and that was in 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman," but to By that time, the Brat Pack torch had already been passed on to others with firmer hair and more eye-catching CVs. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie with a clear conscience. Just look at a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace before Rona Jaffe feasts on his soul.
