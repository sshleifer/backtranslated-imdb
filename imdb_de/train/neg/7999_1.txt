This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave it up after an hour and have very much regretted this lesson. the spectacle is terrible and there is almost no conspiracy. My guess is that someone invented a strange form of an animal and started making a story out of it. Borrowing some ideas from films like Resident Evil and Aliens does not lead to a movie like this. If this becomes a top Korean movie, I would rather not even care about a Korean trailer ... By the way, these movies are a good reason to believe that. A high rating means that Movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online games has rated this movie over the past 8 years even though he has no idea what it is about.
