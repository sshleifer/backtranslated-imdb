Like many other Bachchan fans, I eagerly awaited the remake of Sholay. This movie was not. Luckily, they did not use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake does not deserve the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally unconventional dance, the dialogue - all together to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the performers agreed to film because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was absolutely ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding with Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not worry about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
