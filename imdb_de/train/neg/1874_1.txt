I've been a passionate supporter of Hal Hartley ever since I saw his short "Surviving Desire" in high school, and even then he was completely anchored by his searing, brilliant "Henry Fool". But this ten years later sequel is not only unnecessary, but also a shame. <br /> <br /> After a jerky and fast start, "Fay Grim" becomes pseudo-intellectualism, boredom and finally unwarranted unwanted nihilism. And that's just the plot. <br /> <br /> The majority of new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the film: a particularly flat character chops half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself. and it's his only spoken scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's Agent Fulbright, it seems, is the only bright character (a pun intended by Hartley). How is he left? ** SPOILER ** Dead by a car bomb that's easily becoming one of Hartley's most violent Hartley films yet, and in a movie that's all wrong from the start, everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay herself ... well, I will not spoil her fate as the movie All in all, own does well enough (if it does not deal with another goddamn inclined angle, giving the disquieting impression that Hartley moves from Auteur backwards to a fucking movie student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster terrible mess that is not even good-humored enough to enjoy its disarray. Instead, he selfishly infuses the director's typically witty hipster allegations into the "real world," a nastier and meaner one than it needs to be, but not nearly ugly or enough to say anything. In doing so, Hartley tracks all my memories of these people and the wonderful world he originally created for them. I was rarely so depressed in the movies and counted "Leaving Las Vegas," which at least developed new, new characters that we loved before destroying them, rather than immediately ignore their beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Actually.
