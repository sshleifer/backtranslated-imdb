Basically, you take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and break it down into one, and you get that movie. The story looks like this: A few college kids receive voice messages from their own phones predicting their deaths. There's a lot going on with ghosts, which is not scary when you've seen an Asian ghost movie. This movie was pretty annoying because it is very clichéd. It's the same bullcrap, another movie. <br /> <br /> The show was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are in a very difficult situation, something we have not seen in the past. However, the two leading actors have done a good job. <br /> <br /> As far as it is bloody, not much is going on. We get a cool sequence with an arm twisting a head (I do not know how to explain it), but it's been cut away so you do not see anything except the end result. Sometimes you see some blood, including beheaded arms and a zombie (that looked really cool, I might add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The fear in the film is low and widespread and it's really not that scary. You sometimes get some scary pictures, but it's not enough to be scary. It's no different from Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and neither of them scared me. This is really the downfall of this (and most Asian horror movies): If it does not bring the fear, then it just is not so good. <br /> <br /> Regarding direction, Takashi Miike was still doing pretty well. Compared to his earlier films, he seemed a little tame in this film, but he still portrays much of his confused style that he became famous for. Many images were very similar to Miike's (including a scene with a jar of dead fetuses), and the last 15 to 20 minutes seemed to be more Miike than the rest of the movie. Nevertheless, the film is flawed by its unoriginality. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this to people who are big in Asian horror movies (even if they are, I can recommend it much better) or great Miike fans. Warning to anyone who wants to join Miike, this is NOT his best work. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a 4 because she's just mediocre. If published 4 or 5 years ago, it could be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> I also want to deal with Asian horror movies quickly. How come, if it is an Asian horror movie, is he (USA) automatically good? Many of those films in Japan are the equivalent of what Scream, Urban Legends and I know what you did last summer in the 90s. If you've seen one, you've seen it all. And many of these films rely too much on fear and images. If they do not bring the fear they seek, then they are just not so good, and that would not change. Other Asian horror films must be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films that, if they do not frighten or frighten you, at least have great stories, drama, directing, cinematography, and more to support them. Two films that are not only great horror movies, but great movies in general. More Asian horror movies have to be like the cliché: "A ghost just wanted to be found, so he went around killing people through her phone / videotape / house / electrical appliance / hookahs / google search engine / vibrator / food / etc."
