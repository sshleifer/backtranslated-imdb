I love the sexy action and sci-fi movies of the sixties and the actresses who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these movies and it did not matter if they could act (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this movie was that it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has made a European science-fiction movie called "Dragonfly" and the director is fired. The producers therefore choose to leave a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. You're a really beautiful woman in the movie Dragonfly plays, but she's barely there. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his early days fathers and adds them to the script. I wish the film could have been a tribute to these early films. You could have many cameos of actors who performed in them. There is one actor in this movie who was popular from the sixties and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I have to wait for a director to pay homage to the films of the sixties. If anyone reads that, make it as sexy as you can! I'll wait!
