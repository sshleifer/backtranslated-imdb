I have to say that in my childhood, I'm pretty proud of many of the films I borrowed. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the ubiquitous scam film in every actor's resume. Could you just imagine what Whoopie's fired agent told her to sign up with this bitch? "Hey Whoop, you've seen dinosaurs before, you make a movie out of them and you can see Germany!" After that, this agent often had to refer to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that I thought Whoopie must have bought and destroyed every copy of this movie. I just wish she could have done the same thing in my memory, because my sister still crap me because I saw this movie. I mean, come on, I admit, I've seen Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in the cinemas (good reasons why I've given up both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while) childhood, and the greatest tenancy of my life, and that was 16 years ago. I am now 24 years old, if you want to do the math. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think of my list of the worst movies, I do not even mention them, because like a raped stepchild, I try to suppress that it ever happened. Piss off, Whoopie, just be glad that people just acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst luck.
