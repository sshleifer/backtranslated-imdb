Did you pass the in-laws for the weekend? Then this is the movie that speeds up its departure if it does not cause it to trigger a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief through constant nagging. The movie is supposed to be aboard a luxury cruise ship, which means more superannuated car ferry; The plot has more holes than the average sieve and a cast that was dredged from the depths of the Celebrity D-List. An interesting piece of extra entertainment is playing Spot the Villain as passengers board the ship. You will not be wrong! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, clich√©d set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam that are doubled as blood, this film attempts to capture the genres of thriller, action movie and gore feast, while not fulfilling all of them. <Br /> <br /> You have to watch a movie just by laughing at how bad it is.
