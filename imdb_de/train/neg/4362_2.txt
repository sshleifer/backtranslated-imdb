A group of human-looking aliens walking on the ground to eat crashed land on a planet of prehistoric beasts, where they eat all the physcedelic mushrooms and delay them. Filled with shots of "Planet of the Dinosuars" and terrible jokes, this is definitely a must. Acting is also cruel, and while this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (which movie can that be?), This is still pretty scary stuff. It's a 90-minute run that sounds like an eternity and you'll probably curse life. So do yourself a big favor and just keep going, skip that crappy movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The Filmmakers Try to resell this Turd as an MST3K style, making fun of the movie it made a decade ago, and it works to some extent. It's still nothing special. Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a pretty unattractive voice /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Joke Commentary, 17 Behind the Scenes featurette; 7 minutes into the black featurette; Jessica Mills reporting; Stills gallery; and original trailer
