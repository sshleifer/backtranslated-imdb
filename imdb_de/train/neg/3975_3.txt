1st seen 07.12.2002 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses. It seems to me that the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff, and it will be interesting to see what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go their own ways. In this episode of their adventures, they are interns in Rome for a "fashion designer" who brings them straight to the post room to find out what hard work is all about (I think ...). Apart from the typical flirtations with boys, there is not much else than the scenario of Rome until about the movie when it finally turns out why they get fired, then rehired, then fired again and then reinstated. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world and this is reflected in their interpretation. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure (if there is one). Even my kids did not seem to care about this boring "adventure". Let's see, they probably only have a few years to get to their legal adults. We will see what happens then.
