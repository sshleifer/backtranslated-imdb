I think the settings and lighting were very bad. When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really found out the true year of the movie, I was shocked. I did not know there was such a bad movie lately. That was really all I wanted to say. This movie had a good plot, nothing you would not miss if you just read the novel George Orwelll wrote. All I really want to say has been said, other than this one: I can not believe that this movie has possibly received so many awards and nominations. Well, that's all. So long
