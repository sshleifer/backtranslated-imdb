This is a typical 70s sex romp in the Russ Meyer genre, albeit less fancy than in Meyer's work. This film has higher "production values" than many of its contemporaries, which suggests a bigger budget. However, plot, writing and acting are outside the B Zone. Recently, this movie has become a staple of B-movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the 500-channel Universe. If you fancy soft core, this is just about everything else in the B range. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Not more, not less. Jennifer Welles's performance as a "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film was unsurprisingly successful. Confessions of a young American housewife are anything but the worst example. It's visible if this is your kind of movie. 30 years ago this would have been an avant-garde and risky film. In the Showtime / HBO series you can see more or less the same thing these days and in prime time.
