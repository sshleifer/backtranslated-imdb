Hello, I'm from Denmark and one day I had a movie night with my friends. This film was called "Russian Terminator" and it was extremely horrible. After less than half a minute, we decided to scroll forward and stop only for some ridiculous "highlights", or should I say "Lowlights" in the movie. I was actually quite surprised when I found out that this film was produced here in my native Denmark ... that was probably the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
