This movie is awful. Not offensive, but extremely predictable. The film shows the life of a small town family in the mid-sixties. The father, the headmaster, is in a mid-life crisis. Join a pretty teacher from the big city who challenges her students' thoughts with some thought-provoking material, such as thinking for herself. The Headmistress disagrees with her lessons, but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder, wannabe Tara Frederick) is tired of the small city lifestyle and wants to live. She gets bad advice, is hanging around with some bad guys, and apparently family planning at her school was not taught. Shocking! Since director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked on television, this film plays like a more mature version of a post-school special or a very special episode of one of the more secular sitcoms.
