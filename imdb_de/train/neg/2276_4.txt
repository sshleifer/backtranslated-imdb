CLASS '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> 1861 members of the West Point Academy are ripped apart by the outbreak of the civil War. <br /> <br /> Gregory Hoblit's historical drama OK makes an obvious point - virtuous men are blinded by conflict - though the production, despite its authentic details and cast, seems a bit stilted by talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), who have been honored by Dan Futterman as a diligent Southerner, who embraces the defense of slavery and directs him into direct conflict with his former northern friends. The film's emphasis on such a misguided - if sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise shallow and superficial, and Hobbit's direction is more efficient than inspired.
