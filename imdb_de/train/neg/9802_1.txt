Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I first saw this show. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about it and other shows and you know what? This was the measure of disguise. Whenever we wanted to emphasize the stupidity of something (either on TV or anything else), we said "Uh, just like Power Rangers" and laughed. <br /> <br /> Before I visit this page, I could not imagine that there are actually fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to take a look again and understand why people like it. I did not like this view. But I realized: maybe I do not have enough imagination? It may be. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate it with more than one star.
