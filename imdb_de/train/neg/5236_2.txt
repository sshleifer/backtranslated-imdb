My friends and I watched this movie about a week ago, and I think it's absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who will read this) that this movie is not just among the five worst movies, which I've ever seen, but actually has the honor of being number one. I have seen quite a few movies, but none is better than stupid. You could say I loved it when I saw it ... my only apology is that we waited a few hours and were unable to go anywhere without freezing our buttocks. I can not recommend this to anyone. At first I thought we were going to watch a really bad porn movie, but after 10 minutes I figured out that's not the case. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not an action, it's not a horror, it's just awful!
