This was one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991. He looked great. I've always wanted to see him since then, but I've never been able to find him ... ... until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that I was so disappointed that it is unreal. OK, I knew that it would not be an Oscar winner, but still had the hope that it would be fun movie without brain in the blood sport form. Unfortunately, it was not like that, it's Pooh, which was so bad with all the American rock and roll music and acting that it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were rubbish and look fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me only £ 5 and I think I was overpaid by £ 7. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I'll never get that half an hour back
