I remember that I had enjoyed it a few years ago, but I came back to it and wonder why. I think it always looks good and the girls are doing pretty well, but the men prefer to lower the page. Why, why, why do we have to have so incompetent men next to pretty girls in so many English movies about sex? In addition, predictably enough, this begins as a sex farce that resembles the Confessions films but goes through about a third of the way (as we begin to enjoy the presence of the beautiful Me Me Lai), the movie urges us to record it seriously , Not only that, but also the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. In short, this is neither as innocent nor as intelligent as it seems. Richard O'Sullivan might have helped as such a key figure, but I think that's one of his worst accomplishments. It's worth it for the ladies.
