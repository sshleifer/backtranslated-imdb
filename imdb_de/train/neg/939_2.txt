I loved the Batman TV series and I was looking forward to it. They tried, however, to do too much. Why did they have the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to find the Batmobile was a mystery to me. I do not want to upset Burt or Adam for the way they look now ... It's been 35 years since they appeared on Batman and Robin. I would rather have seen how the ex-stars made a comment. The Batmobile side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As far as the Flashback movie is concerned, I think it was too short and too much was missing. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed the penguin and the joker for about a minute, just to tell the same stuff I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke, even though he hated it and was a former smoker. It was for those who would like to read the book. I am sure it has more than this has shown. For example, why were there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes? Where were Commishioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut and so on? As I said, even those who were here were barely in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really stupid.
