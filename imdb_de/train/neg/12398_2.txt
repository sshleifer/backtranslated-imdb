Look, it's the third one, so you already know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to justify the second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Terrible, approaching God terribly. <br /> <br /> When Maniac Cop makes a murder spur, a reporter exclaims, "What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death." Rainbow are not black and can never be. 2- Rainbow are harmless and can never cause pain or death. 3 - A message reporter valuable to his agency could find another way to describe the consequences of a murder blight. "A Black Rainbow of Death" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation. <br /> <br /> This is what you want.
