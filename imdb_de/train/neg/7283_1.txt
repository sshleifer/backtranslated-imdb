Facts about National Lampoon go to the movies, including National Lampoon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The film itself is typical of Lampoon. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to a movie. <br /> <br /> After I had finished looking at it, I began to wonder why on Earth it is called "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" and why it was even thought. much less. It would be like calling Austin Powers' An American Guy Goes to the Movies. Like lame. He is not American and does not go to the movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's so-called "satire" is funny and no one watches movies, which causes a problem. I was hoping it would be something like the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie from National Lampoon to Animal House, though you could not tell from the quality of the film. After a standard poorly developed, rough and amateur, does he cause a headache? not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems twice as long. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are usually renamed? and this little catastrophe falls into this category. It has two separate titles - probably to try to promote it for people who are too stupid to remember how bad a panning of home video critics was in 1982-83. 'Hmm, movie madness? I have never heard of this movie! Let us rent it! And then the realization: "Hey, wait a minute, that's just National Lampoon goes to the movies!" <br /> <br /> It was put back by MGM / UA, never released in cinemas or on DVD; It occasionally appears on television a few times a decade, which is just the only place you'll find it. <br /> <br /> It is divided into three stories? a spoof on self-enlargement videos, butter and recklessness by corporations, and police brutality / cop buddy movies (I think). The first segment shows Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy divorcing his wife and doing something else. I'm not sure what it was because it was so boring that my mind began to drift. Until the sex scene emerged. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer who is raped (not asked) by a piece of butter that decides to become queen of margarine so she can stop the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the film: "Only I can fall in love with my son!" If you think that does not sound very funny, are you right? it is not. And just imagine? It is the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a police officer following a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his nerve and shoot the man. It contains a funny scene, but it is extremely exaggerated. Only Lloyd really shows humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, but strangely surreal. The part where he strangles his victim and the meek policeman looks like he's watching everything unfold, at least a giggle or two low standards. The authors of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and wise in faking so-called stereotypes? The flaw is that the movie becomes a huge contradiction, favoring the standard T & A measures instead of the conspiracy. raw humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It's easy to see that none of the actors was intrigued with the material and mumbled their lines, often so embarrassing that they rarely make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The film is, as I said, not funny. I once laughed at just one line and even then it was half-hearted. Two giggles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies look like normal salmon tracks. <br /> <br /> I like the series of National Lampoon Vacation (or at least three out of four installments) and their classic pet house, but their recent bombshells with direct videos like Golf Punks (with great comic genius Tom Arnold) are a good example of why their magazine was not printed more than a decade ago. It's getting really old, very fast. Unfortunately, a new movie called Gold Diggers will be released with the 'approval stamp'. It's like having a movie condemned before it's even released. Maybe they should not advertise their name everywhere? <br /> <br /> Borrower: 'This movie is bad. It receives the National Lampoon Seal of Quality. This will teach you not to do so terribly next time. Â«Forget the death penalty. Just put a bunch of criminals in a room and let them take care of it for a whole month every month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain his rotten abomination. I give up.
