Anita and I seem a little more than an apology to Meera Syal, the author of the novel and the script, to voice her prejudices, complaints, and her general dislike of the English. The general feeling of Indian superiority over the English in this film is evil. <br /> <br /> The English in this film are considered to be overweight, violent, spurned, talked of, neglected with children, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating bad food, and idiotic - significantly, the local priest can end up being Films are "redeemed" only by turning to Indian culture The Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, can speak many languages, caring and loving parents, and high school nutrition. The movie is so insidious that I am amazed that the BBC has even funded it. If, conversely, an English family in an Indian community so portrayed, the film would have been considered racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow shot so far into the forehead. I thought it would settle in my hairline. First, the gossip scene between the women at the Divali celebration - Subtext: The English are dirty and promiscuous - and the men - Subtext: English women are prostitutes. Second, the food with Anita, where Neemas family lies to her for cutlery - Subtext: The English are so stupid, you can let them do everything. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt for all English - even English weddings are a contempt object - that's obvious throughout the movie. The character of Anita was so horribly drawn - almost the fallen woman - that I had finished the film and felt angry. <br /> <br /> This is not a "bend-like-like Beckham," in which the humor is geared toward love exaggerating the behavior and customs of a community through someone within that community, and it's a movie about two girls dating different backgrounds that come together. Instead, Anita and I seem to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the English are almost a version of the untouchable Indian caste. This is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks on the "other" community of the film: the English. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and I are a hateful, arduous job. On this basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
