It was a waste of time ... the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes ... although the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> After the film started, I tried to cast doubt on it, telling myself that it might become interesting later, but it was never unique. The same conspiracy was played over and over again, but what became worse was that the main hole was the whole story of how to kill the bad guys, that he or she did not have their hearts and wanted to close the movie right after the start. <br /> <br /> Overall, too much hype, but unable to deliver.
