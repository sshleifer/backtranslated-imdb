That should be my kind of movie. Even if it was shit, it would still have to be in my alley; Hell, I like "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a thing for stupid alien / demon / adventure movies in my heart. Let's say again why I chose to see this at all. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-Fi almost always fascinates me 2. I'm a big fan of archeology and this movie contains a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with high-quality effects. 4. I generally enjoy Christian Slater and the village. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So, this movie had potential, at least in the cheese dairy horror section of the video stores, but the boy's got it on his ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I ... I mean, let's be honest, both are melodramatic. But now to some of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the movie is worse overall, Reid's performance is really terrible. Not only are we talking poorly, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply beyond her league ... totally. Seeing her try to play the role of a trained scientist was not much different from what you see in the bad porn setup. I mean, it's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those who are curious, she does not get naked, only in a stupid, totally unnecessary love scene except for a bra. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, the movie might work. But the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old. I had only realized after watching the DVD that this was a video game adaptation, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The plot jumps from Slater's childhood back and forth in an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that has happened. Of course he has amnesia. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by a unit 713, a paranormal force apparently chasing evil. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, you know, you never really know, unless it was one of those speakers I left during that time. The film begins with Slater hunting artifacts. He received his latest play after some negotiations with a "Chilean mercenary troupe specializing in the sale of rare antiques." Maybe I have the exact quote wrong, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a wicked doctor who wants to set off some Hellwings (no reason) on Earth, experiments with children, Super Demon / Alien Human hybrids, "photonic" orbs (the demons can not catch the sunlight and of course Slater and the village to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even wade through the clich√©d elements. The script urgently needed to be redesigned to narrow the focus and give some depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn angry? Oh yes, people are doomed to fail and he's just trying to save humanity. I think he is infected? How did this happen? Oh, he has one of the evil demons in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super-slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi state of parasitic aliens / demons that "fuse" with their host's spine). Of course, Slater, like Blade, is half slug-power, but his slug "did not completely fuse with an electric shock," thank goodness. Oh, and the people with these "fused" spikes have no idea that they are half alien / demon, and act as good members of the community until they are given a secret signal, from where they become killer bombs. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So a lot of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is. <br /> <br /> Even the end is completely stupid, because it turns out that everything is not so This big deal is to settle in the first place ... at least a little dynamite can not keep up. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you can see, but a really bad movie.
