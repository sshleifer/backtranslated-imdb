About the baby: Why did not the big brother think he was hungry for a bottle or some food or a diaper change? He would have to keep screaming incessantly without interruption after those many hours. Definitely stupid to take the baby out of a safe place when it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> And why was the street miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to go somewhere? Have not uprooted trees fallen on the streets and blocked them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that the cops at the roadblock did not immediately follow a young person who would overthrow them, especially if they said that was the case. It's dangerous to go there , <br /> <br /> That said, it was nice to have a movie kids can watch for safety.
