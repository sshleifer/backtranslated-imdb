One friend once asked me to read a script he had selected from a movie studio. To say that it was one of the most incapable and blatant screenplays I've ever read would be a bold understatement. I never told him that. Why? Because in a world where films like "While She Was Out" can be lit up green and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a script with no character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it will not be sold. <br /> As many other critics have pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly signed Woman-in-Peril movie that disregards the housewife Basinger, who was chased by four unusual hoods on Christmas Eve , Any point of criticism is legitimate, from weak dialogue to bad acting to stunning logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a few things I noticed: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how much we should think her husband is an idiot, the house is a mess of toys. Since when did it turn into child abuse to make children pick themselves up after another? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially different gangs are rare anywhere except Hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen <br /> 3) Sure, the movie is stupid. But also the innumerable "thrillers" through which I have sat, where the women are presented as plaintive, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see how a woman got the best from her tormentors. <br /> <br /> 4) I loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous reviewer coined the phrase, I really think that this movie should be renamed "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
