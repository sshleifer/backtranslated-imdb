A movie starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. In the studios less controlled by the content, which allows the actors, authors and director more creativity. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This movie immediately assumes that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one gets a real backstory, so we never know why the characters behave the way they do. Explanations of physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you have one at the end of this film I left. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I saw this movie and thought it was horrible. <br /> <br /> Your question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save it?" My Answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it."
