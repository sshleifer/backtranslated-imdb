The film uses a top title for a lame story. Kill Kill would have been nice. The film contains taboo scenes so that the viewer can move back in his chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and jerky. The movie is something a newbie Videographer could have summoned. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write ten lines of text to criticize this film if it's not worth ten lines of my time, but I have to keep insisting that people know that nonsense is avoided. If people rely on you to choose a good film for the movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by dealing with this filth.
