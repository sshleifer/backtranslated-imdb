This horror movie is really weak, so if I comment on the right movie. There's nothing really bad going on when a family adopts a cute little German Shepard puppy. I had a German Shepard and it is a really good dog. However, I did not have the idea to get a movie from this movie, but rather from the comedy "K-9". But that's another story. This movie really does not have a lot of horror, because the worst scene is over and looks really kitschy. We also see that a man almost puts his hand in a lawnmower. That's about it. However, the father suspects something, because his family seems to be quite strange. Somewhere, he finds out if you hold a mirror while you sleep while you sleep. You can see if they are obsessed. All in all, a really weak horror movie, even for television standards. TV movies that work are pretty good "This House Possessed" and there's another ghost house movie about a woman and those weird creatures that are rather good too. This one is really boring.
