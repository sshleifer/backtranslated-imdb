I saw this movie alone in the dark and outside was full moon! I did not do it on purpose, it just happened that way. So all the elements for this movie were there to scare me out of hell !! Actually, I wanted to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I figured there was a chance, unfortunately I did. The acting was terrible, the only one with decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a horror fan, it's the same thing you've seen many times. Some scenes did not make sense at all and you just have the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The (scary) scenes looked like they belonged to a horror film from the 80s, when there was not enough technology, but then good movies were filmed! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie. I thought they could not invest some money and do it decently? !! I could no longer agree to the ratings of the film, it is also my rating for it, 3 out of 10 points.
