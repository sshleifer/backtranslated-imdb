When I was 11, Fat 2 was like a crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric and addictive experience. My sister and I would see it, rewind and watch it over and over until we passed out or became too confused and too hostile to stand each other. So, if you're an 11-year-old girl and you've rated this movie as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original fat," you blame your adolescent adolescent hormones, and you can be sure that this is unyielding The fixation with absolute garbage will pass. <br /> <br /> But if you're not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to point out that Grease 2 was anything but an inhumane, unsophisticated slipshod embarrassment to anyone involved in its production, distribution, and / or or use. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I will now pay tribute to the film by explaining why it is blowing? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should promote the narration or develop the characters. In Grease 2, the music is obscenely meaningless with a few controversial exceptions. Most songs seem to tell gimped allusions to sex in exaggerated and general ways ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do it For Our Country" and "Prowlin '") without making any concrete statement about characters or themes film. In addition, the entire music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast shows even the grossest appearance of an ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. The T-birds should be angry, if not at least a little bit sympathetic, but instead each one of them is an annoying witty Dufus loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-Bird jacket and introduces him to the gang, Michael should kick her to the ground, spit on it and duck to scrub all the parts of his body she touched. But of course he accepts it as if it were gold, for despite the fact that this is a bunch of limping meatheads, there is no greater honor than being one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, nice, resourceful and in every way above average (despite his musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie eventually hugs him when he turns out to be the man behind the Mask revealed. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a sloppy, slack chewing gum, smacking, dirty sweatshirt that carries a cruel, rude and trashy dingbat. Aside from being pretty (I think), she does not have sympathetic qualities, so the audience gets no justification for the depth of Michael's appeal for her. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I did not want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor, since there are obviously so many cranks that find such a comparison unfair. However, I will say this to those of you who think they want to revisit this chaos for old times: Fat 2 is an experience that looks like you are re-experiencing your first kiss. Only you are now 32 years old and kiss a thirteen-year-old child with acne and boring braces. The magic is gone and you feel dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
