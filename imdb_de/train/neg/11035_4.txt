This is the most saccharine romance I've ever eaten. The perfect movie for an idle housewife in a scarf, dress and ostrich-trimmed, high-heeled mules, which you can see lying on the couch in the afternoon while eating sweets. In fact, candies play a prominent role in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could watch until the end is that I finally saw Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene in Keanu. In most of his films, he moves too fast to have a good look. The only quick action in this show is that Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotion - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are torn - the hero is shamefully perfect and mild. The aristocratic warm-blooded family clich√© of the old world is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish, Italian or Mexican? This is a fairytale story. <br /> <br /> I knew before the end of the title that this would not be the movie I was hoping for. The glowing grapes looked like the model of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I did not list his name, but the art director was certainly Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages located in Fuchsia. This movie was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like the dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (The candies also looked really good!)
