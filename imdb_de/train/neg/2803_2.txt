Considering the limitations of this film (the entire film in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors), it should have been a lot better. If you have those limits when filming, how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they talked a hair among the actors in Clerks, only that this was an entertaining movie that had no substance. Well, it tried, but it really fails. <br /> <br /> It tries to self-reference itself in a few parts, but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors that it was just bad. And the main character Neal guy, what a miserable locker. There were clearly 10 people who made this 'movie' and everyone knew each other, and they probably had a real rock band, but unfortunately, these people have no idea how horrible they all are. This was done in 2005, but they all look so na√Øve that it smells like before the grunge era. Fortunately, I did not pay for it (Starz on Demand delivers again!), but it was not Studio 666 under the title "The Possessed", it does not matter what you do with the title, it can not be otherwise. This could have been a much better movie - there is no excuse for filthy filmmaking, if you have the obviously limited parameters the filmmakers had when making the film, and work within those limits, you should do what you control can and the stuff you can work with the best that you can. Instead, they thought mediocrity would be good enough. And the music video, wow that was bad, I got through it quickly. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you're in the whole B-movie crap, I suppose you'll see this.
