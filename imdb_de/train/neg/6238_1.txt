Oh man, it's amazing how anyone can claim that global warming is a science. Well, I think this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this subject sound complicated, even if it only takes common sense to see this whole thing, is a big hoax of a man with his own gambling program! How did scientists estimate historical temperatures? this planet? By estimating the sunspot activity. Has anyone ever asked if this method is correct? No, not even Gore! How about predicting future sunspot activity when it was so accurate in the past? According to the sunspot activity, the temperature today fully agrees with what it should be. How is it that the temperature in the entire universe (relatively) has risen as high as on Earth? Are our SUVs lowering the temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out that this can not be anything but a HOAX. Please explore it yourself. What can Al Gore and his elite friends, such as Rothschild (Bankers family, who organizes Live Earth events) benefit from? Well, the new World Bank will be based on carbon credits, which means a tax on everything that causes carbon leakage. And it's easier to get around those taxes if people believe it's the world to save, if only the world is over money, centralized control and more power for the elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is not it noble to volunteer to pay carbon credits to save the world, especially when it comes to your own business? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blind. Please do your own research and use your own common sense. I am sure that you will come to the right conclusion!
