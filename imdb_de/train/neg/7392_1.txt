I still look in shock at the video store as Steven Seagal continues to release 3 movies in less than a year with his Bad Action movies hit. Attack power, which is the 3rd, promised no less the first entry into the sci-fi genre for our ever-widening Seagal. In front of my gullible eyes flashed before bad-glowing eyes pictures. Unfortunately, this is not the case without entertainment and a movie as bad as it comes. <br /> <br /> Seagal captured a little bit with the trashy but enjoyable Shadow Man the last time we saw him. Anyway, the attack power has to be his absolutely worst movie! Do not argue for a kill, a ticker, or even for Black Dawn down in the Septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to the form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word key. <br /> <br /> Seagal is yet another agent / I'm an absolute enemy, but the name Lawson wants revenge for the murder of his team, which forces him to a nefarious conspiracy, a really bad drug to the unsuspecting Do not mention that the traders are not from here. <br /> <br /> The entire production of director to actor is bad. Was this movie filmed in the dark? It must be the worst lit film since Howling 2.The action is horrible and very bad. <br /> <br /> The producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most: putting stunt double on stunt double and calling the terribly named Steven Seagal show little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it was said that Attack Force was not the film that Stevie (originally Harvester) signed for and certainly needs to be better than Attack Force. The post - manipulation of production has not made it more conclusive and Seagal looked worse. I feel bad for director Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal pin as they are judged forever for the badly-hijacked re-shoots of production. <br /> <br /> So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to pay for this mess Bad Attack Force has turned out to be, really, is he going to shoot another movie?
