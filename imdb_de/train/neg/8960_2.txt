The only thing that often comes to my mind while writing this review is that I never get that one and a half hours back !!! To show that I'm not just bubble, I compare the movie with the other movies of the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube)! cube was not great, but it was original and made up for some technical weaknesses! hypercube As a sequel lost the benefit of originality, but it looked pretty sharp and I liked it even better than dice (the story was better)! Cube zero compared to its predecessors is really not worth it! A complete lack of good effects, a very f *** ck script and just bad bad acting do not combine well! Example: The whole time during the movie I thought it would be unbelievably stupid if ... happened and then it would happen, so it's not very original! My advice: do not lose the one and a half hours that I lost !!!!!!!! oh and I hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
