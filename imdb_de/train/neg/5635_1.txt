I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I wasted a few hours of my life watching this movie. I still can not believe that I managed to see it in its entirety. Was there really a point for the movie? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see that dreadful, pointless piece of pathetic apology for a movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without hunting the facts But is Dafoe married or does one see the terrible actress in this movie in real life when it was an attempt to start her career? If so, I'm afraid it must have failed. <br /> <br /> I am posting this In the hope that I can get someone to watch this movie, even if a person complies with my comments and decides that they would much rather watch the drying of the paint, I have that Feeling I had done something good in the world, if only I had had the same advice ...
