The movie begins in 1840 in Japan, when a man kills his wife and lover and commits suicide. It's a very bloody, bloody sequence. Then it springs to today ... well 1982, to be exact. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and her annoying little child move to Japan because of her husband. You rent a house and - surprise! Surprise - it's just the house where the murders took place! The three dead are ghosts nearby (make-up is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> Sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between. There is an attack of giant crabs, which is just uncomfortable! They look so fake - I swear, I saw the strings have pulled one - and they mumble !!!!! There is a senseless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably only to show Georges body), another about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for the plot) and a really stupid exorcism towards the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Regarding acting - Albert was fine as the husband and McClure were pretty good friends as a family. But George is - as always - great in a lousy movie. It gives this film the necessary boost - but can not save him. I give this a 2 only for her and bloody opening and closing. Besides, this is a very boring movie.
