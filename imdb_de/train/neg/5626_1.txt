I caught this movie on a subway train on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked it up in the IMDb to see what others think about it. I was not surprised how many stupid people enjoyed this fuzz. However, I was surprised to look at the comments to read the Hated It categories, only to find that there were none. I was shocked about that; I always look at the hate, it's always the way it is, the one who hates a movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow this movie came through unscathed by the haters, I say no to it and proudly announce that I hate this movie! I know I should talk in detail about why I hate this movie, but if he does, he would only give this movie more respect than he deserves.
