This movie is a sequel to "White Zombie" because it is made by the same man (Halperin) and contains zombies. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his time, however, does not manage to deliver with this. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and a search to destroy the source of his power so that the zombies can be freed. Also a love interest for the bad man. <br /> <br /> Where this film really stands out is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombies look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we can not really see much of the zombies in action, and the love story seems to play far too big a role for a horror movie (though this later has a valid plot reason). <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see zombies from the 1930s who would attack helpless city dwellers, but this film just did not work. And no strong rogue (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight our heroes. And the use of Lugosis eyes? A nice effect, but misleading, since he's never in the movie ... Why not re-create with the eyes of the new actor? All in all, a movie that could be reworked with a small script and one day could be a powerful remake (especially if it stays in the same post-war time frame). Heck, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie has hope.
