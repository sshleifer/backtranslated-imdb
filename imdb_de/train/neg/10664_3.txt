A very tired-looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary who fights with his former employers for Gizmo, who want to sell these non-heroes to "the Iranians". Low-rent video nonsense by the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offers decent action material and a lot of improperly staged "drama" ... lack of logic and really dreadful dialogues are the defining aspects, even if the final twists and ties shift could have been a nice ending to a better movie. Burt still has presence, though it also means that you notice more when he utter insulting half-baked "one-liners".
