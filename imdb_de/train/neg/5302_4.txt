Dewaana as a film goes through the usual stereotypes. Husband and wife fall in love and marry, husband is allegedly killed by a friend of the family, who wants his family to be lucky, wife to remarry and surprise man no. 1 to appear. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan perform well. Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the moves and is nothing more than a common Bollywood villain The music of Nadeem Shravan is great, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that performs the movements.
