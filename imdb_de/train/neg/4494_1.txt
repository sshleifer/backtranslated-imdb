*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From here, the whole movie collapses. First we hit a rogue program with the hint that we will get ghosts, vampires, werewolves, and the like. We get a guy with a backward accent talking about endless garbage, two "ghosts" who have no real purpose, no character, and a lot of henchmen. Someone told me they are vampires (right out of Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not notice. <br /> <br /> The funny guy with a ridiculous name has the same problem as the oracle only for a lot longer and even worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, does it, then makes it go on and does it until it gets confused and stupid. His last line before leaving is similar to Storm's "Do you know what happens to a toad ..." in X-Men in extreme madness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy, pitiful clich√© and Monica Bellucci as a woman is doing nothing but what we expect as soon as we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we get another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is supposed to be the one. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what he uses it for. Kung bloody foot all the time. And though he can stop 1000 bullets, he is still cut by a sword and still makes 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see impressive forces. I wanted him to make the wildest, craziest and craziest people with people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the "wow". <br /> <br /> The legendary chase. That can not be bad. Well ... no, that's not it. It's just not what we used to do. ALL cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So, all that Wow has taken from us is all we get right now is a good chase sequence with a kung fu fight. OK, it's not neo, but you would have thought he explained the reality of the Matrix to his closest friends. At least they taught them something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's going on with you in the Matrix, it's not real, as long as you understand that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> You go there. Easy. <br /> <br /> OK, so the persecution is not bad. It never gets boring and it does not seem to be 16 minutes. It's just so unimportant. And it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final highlight of the movie is probably the worst you can imagine. You have this whole thoughtful plan that includes three crews. They then show it only sporadically between Morpheus's long, super-preached monologue. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what three teams need for this plan. You know, but you do not know who does what, when. So if a crew goes down, you do not care, and you do not know how that affects what happens. <br /> <br /> I gather it, so it happens that Trinity can get back into the Matrix to fix the end. That's the only reason why it happens. What raises the question, why had originally 6 people had to be sent? Trinity comes in alone in five minutes! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled equally lazily. Ooohh !!! He meets another 100 Agent Smiths !!! Woooooo !!! That must have thought a lot. Only now they are in a corridor, so the fight has no magnitude and is over in a moment. Man, what a great finale! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember all that I said was bad about the oracle and the stranger? Put it together and double it, so really the architect is appalling. The only reasonable potential of him is that he is just setting the cliffing climax. <br /> <br /> And then he blows it! <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the options he gives Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all people die !!! Considering the choice, the film tries to explore that the hero is not really one. If he had the choice to save humanity and die the woman or save the woman and kill humanity, there is the potential for inner torment and tension. With Trinity in the middle of the fall, there is the potential of a real cliffhanger that would have made the third look much more important. But no. He did not save anyone or save the mistress. <br /> <br /> Well, the worst part about the original matrix was that Neo died and then came back to life in the end. In the year it came out, everyone was so upset that Jar Jar was so stupid that they did not realize he was looking at Steven Hawking at the end of the Matrix. "The oracle told me I would fall in love with the one, and I love you" ... Come on !!!! How could the whole world have missed how incredibly terrible that was? <br /> <br /> So, what do the Wachowski do in the sequel? Well, they make the end of the original better. As? Well, if I do almost exactly the same thing again (just swapping characters), only so much worse, I think my fa and r keys would be worn out if I write long before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger just is not a cliffhanger. It is a memory. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in many ways. And what's worse, this is not a movie with insufficient budget. It's not a movie with too short a schedule. It is not a movie that has been wiped out. It is not a movie in which too much influence has come from outside. This is exactly the movie the Wachowski had with Warner's fortune behind them. And that's what makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it did not have enough time or money. Matrix reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not completely. The most disappointing and disappointing movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Indisputable. <br /> <br />
