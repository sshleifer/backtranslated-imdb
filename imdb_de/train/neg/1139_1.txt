Please note that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. But I really want to say something. I am currently researching for the university after the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person on which the main character is based was in reality completely different !!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license were approved. The real Dr. Bucke fully advocated hysterectomies to cure the insanity of women, and never practiced anything as liberal as the movie portrays. I think it's ridiculous to see different movie critics writing for legitimate newspapers saying that this film has a historical foundation! The only fact that I can see is the friendship between dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Do not waste your time with a movie that ignores the horror that real women experienced with this doctor, now glorified by the movie industry.
