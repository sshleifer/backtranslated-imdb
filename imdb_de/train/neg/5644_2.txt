What happened to the British TV drama? From John Major to Tony Blair, the focus of the genre of social realism seems to have slimmer, postponing normative to women-centered narratives about the nasty domestic issues of nice middle-class professionals. Not buying the good stuff? Please do not let that be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The author's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is mostly stale clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong in terms of meaningful looks that the director keeps at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve. Poor looks, however, are a poor substitute for character depth if the author has failed to provide such material to the actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation; But that's not as important as the failed marriage of the central figure and its associated problems. Is the husband of Cusack a perfect bastard? Is her son completely traumatized by the dissolution of the marriage? Making this a central theme is not a sign of insight - it shows a profoundly narcissistic identification of the writer and director with a character who should do their job. Lynda La Plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels like it matters and involves other viewers as home-bound neurotics; apparently Paula Milne is not up to the task.
