This film fails miserably on all levels. I have an idea, let us bring all those involved in this film to a hot zone in the Middle East. If we are lucky, they will all be shot and we will never have to waste our time again. Did I mention that in my whole life I've never been so bitter about a cinematic mess? My God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than spend 10 minutes apologizing for a movie. If I ever meet someone who was involved in this movie, I'll spit in his face and then beat them up meaninglessly. These are my two cents.
