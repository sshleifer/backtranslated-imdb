This relic of a short film starts with a teenager trying to get a driver's license. With every conceivable topic that relates to cars, it is quickly distracted. <br /> <br /> Things like dune buggies, drag racing, custom paint jobs and car salons are discussed. It is often tried to be humorous, but instead the film is boring, undressed and sometimes even sexist. None of the people in the movie is actually heard. Instead everything is done in narratives and voiceovers. I'm sorry, but I can not stand that. <br /> <br /> "Dad, can I borrow the car?" It's just another pointless filler taking his time on his TV show "Wonderful World Of Disney." 1.10
