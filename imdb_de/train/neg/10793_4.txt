I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novella by science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, who have twins tied together by a family impresario to start a rock band Almost deliberately gimmicky , the film is half too clever (if you forgive the pun). By blending genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the great documentary Lost In La Mancha) quickly lose their way. I was never sure if I should take it all seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it was just a bit much. Besides, the promised rock and roll did not move me. I was a little too reminiscent of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, a movie I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were just not that good and the main characters were not sympathetic either. An unfavorable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
