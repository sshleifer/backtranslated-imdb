The only reason why I give this movie no less than 3 stars is that it does not quite match a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is stunningly boring and terribly unpardonable British. The premise of this film may sound promising, the whole teleporter concept, but the direction they went in was completely uninteresting. It was more a film about research funding and bowties than projection lasers. The actors were wooden, emotionless and reserved. The love relationship between the two scientists was anything but fascinating. I could never tell what the attraction was between them, since the chemistry did not exist. Nor did I really understand why the head-man with a slender face decided to slaughter every one he met. At least now I know that I should always give a fair hearing to someone before I cut off their research scholarships, otherwise they'll romp around and willingly kill with silly hand gestures.
