I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M.D .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially incompetent, as is Laurie's character house. Meanwhile, Tucci's "Straight Guy", the emphatic Doctor Seger, has not been developed into a more interesting character, like the fallible "Straight Boys" Cuddy and Wilson. Adrienne Holland, the character of Indira Varma, is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's Doctor Cameron to be a coincidence. Someone at CBS apparently noticed the success of House, MD, and invited his staff to bring him a similar show, hoping that mimicry would be successful. However, copying a show like House requires the same high level of wit and excitement, and Tucci and his company are simply not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the show was canceled until I read the show comments on IMDb, but that does not surprise me.
