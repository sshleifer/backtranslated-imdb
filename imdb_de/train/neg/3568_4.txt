The truth is, a movie based on a Harold Robbins novel will not win prizes. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B-picture in budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a TV movie. The action is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is a fix. As a reviewer said about a particular Katherine Hepburn performance, her range goes from A to B. Ms. Zedora manages to get to G. Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserve better. Nevertheless, the whole thing can be fun in a trashy way. As it is for Robbins, it's all about sex and nudity. If you are looking for fun and are not too sober, this could be for you.
