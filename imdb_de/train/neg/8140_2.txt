I saw this movie about Mystery Science Theater when it's called "Live by Night". This title is less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it would be called Batperson, more specifically. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats, I think, because he wants a better cure for rabies. That is not really clear. It is clear that he and his wife visit a cave and are bitten by a bat. Why a scientist has to do a tour to study bats is incomprehensible to me. Should he not be able to go in alone? Now, after being bitten, he and his wife go to the honeymoon, where he gets seizures. You go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you should look for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
