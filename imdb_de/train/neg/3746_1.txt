As hard as I can believe, with all the terrible reality scenarios of recent years, this must take the worst place so far. I still wonder if this was really just a parody of the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, he would surely be behind it. Can a rock band push deeper than INXS to do such a shameful thing? The premise is simple and feeble-minded. Audition, a bunch of karaoke, refuses to become the new lead singer of INXS, taking the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band commits the ultimate act of pathetics by submitting to a bunch of talentless wannabes to become the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its best. So they trudged all those terrible singers (I thought American Idol had their share of Doozies) making terrible interpretations of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song you can imagine. And then they come to the INXS band members who seriously discuss the merits of these candidates. In almost every nightclub in every city in the world, you can see better (and more original) rock performers. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual uncreative elements of any other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host / ecee, lame assessment of performances and lame booting of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows be even more predictable? It's clearly a publicity stunt by the band. a last breath of hope to revive their lost fame before they finally fall into oblivion. Michael Hutchence must turn in the grave if he had a touch of dignity during his lifetime. Not that INXS was ever a great band, but I had no idea they were so pathetic. If INXS is at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the last proof that rock and roll is dead once and for all.
