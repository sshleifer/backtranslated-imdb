Dialogue: stilted, cliché; Acting: Hammy, cliché; Content: predictable, clichéd. <br /> <br /> What is Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this "B" drop? Plummer was established decades before the film was made, and Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind him ... Must have been desperate. <br /> <br /> The bad guys all have bad accents - * bad * bad guy accents! (Plummer especially!) Where did he learn German? And most of them also have bad guys. The innocent onlookers have exaggerated their panic enough to make you laugh. The good guy survives, among other things: * A 5 "throwing knife, which is deeply embedded in his shoulder - pulls it out easily and seconds later you use the arm without difficulty; * Marines machine gun fire (I think someone referred to a .50) in the Leg that he is sorting out by tying a bandage around his trouser leg and after that he is barely flabby; * several fistfights, in which he lays several blows in the face and is in the skull -first into a door-frame; * a fall backwards the third floor on the pavement with no sign of a twisted ankle or any other minor inconvenience.The script has exactly 3 neat lines, the rest at the time everything is so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> OK "It's not all bad." Plummer brings along a certain class, and he's undoubtedly the best actor in this movie a lot, but he can be the callous villain without the ham Exploit the techniques used by most of the villains here Lives somewhat threateningly with his "Ve haff vays and meance" scenes, but you always know that you watch Christopher Plummer playing the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The drama as it is is a kind of '70s-007' film, in which the delivery of wood lines meets Bruce Lee's obviously blatant battle scenes, but it's not nearly as good as a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee -Movie. Do not bother.
