Is not someone else tired of that old clich√©? Where an almost dead person shows up in a horror movie, gives us some information, and then tears off his head for no apparent reason? I know that it is me. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the use in this movie is worthless. If you saw the first movie (the first remake I should say), the information is completely worthless because you already knew it. I guess you can say that it's not worthless to the main characters. But why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Would not he want to live? Sure, he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie titled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first was the sequel to the original 70s movie. It gets a bit complicated for someone like me. You see, I'm probably part of a minority of people my age who even knew there was a HHE2, let alone an original HHE1. And now that we've got a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named just like the sequel to the original HHE1, it just makes it worse! But anyway ... <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes was decent. In the end, the idea was better than the presentation, but he probably had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not a good horror director. He's just made a couple of good horror movies (Nightmare on Elm Street, New Nightmare), a couple of fine (scream) and some awful ones (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, and he did swamp thing too ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category. I only saw for a few minutes, but it was awful. Now he has co-written the new HHE2 ... and it's such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original movie. It was tense. I think that had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex-crazy teens. We felt dirty. In the first hour we were in hell and finally the good avenged the bad guys in the last moments and it felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tensions. No voltage. Only violent things usually happen to stupid people. There is hardly any threatening presence here. Only ugly hobos hiding under rocks. <br /> <br /> I get tired of horror movies where people die because they are as stupid as they make mistakes. I just saw "Deep Blue Sea" recently, where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk in the water during the speech and was then eaten by a shark, just because the idiot stays close to the water .. something no one in the given situation would do! Here is exactly the same. People go off themselves to suffer a leak, even though they know people are dying ... seriously, could not a little break wait? And then, if you think people have learned, someone else goes out by itself! Seriously, is not that scary when the characters bring their A-Game and still lose? I would think so ... <br /> <br /> It even delivers below. It should have been the first remake like "The Fog" (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything. <br /> <br /> But it's actually downgraded. Less bad guys. No voltage. Surely we have more time in the caves, but not much happens there. In the end, there seem to be only two or three bad guys. The last film gave the impression of a whole people. Where is this strain? Who still watches them through binoculars? Seriously, this is what this movie should have brought us, but it ends with exactly the same promise that the last movie gave us, with the same scene in which one is "watched". Come on! I give the devil that it is due. The look of the movie is good, but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not think fans of gore will like that ... though I'm probably wrong! There is Gore (though most of it is accelerated in the dark), but without the tension and the characters that interest you even ... the Gore does nothing in my book! In the end you are not afraid. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8 year old girl). They do not even feel that they have seen something new.
