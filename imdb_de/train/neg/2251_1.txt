Really an amazing bunch of Pap! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-moving, soul-destroying, mind-boggling film that slashes its own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well, almost necessary acting is done for the skinny dialogue, each one Scene is at least twice as long as necessary, the complicated details of how this career collapses or that career is rising are just too dreary and banal for words. The music would be good if you did not have to sit through the movie, but really, three good songs are not a sufficient reward for the effort you need to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are watching this movie, I prayed for god narcolepsy or someone who shoots me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never again.
