I was not sure if Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the movie hit "Malibu Express". With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a director. The action written by Sidaris, which the Academy ungratefully ignored, is a complex script with many invisible twists. The main characters composed for a sexually based radio station called KSXY. Smart, KSXY is indeed their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill," they face their longtime nemesis Kane, who tries to steal one of Russia's most valuable diamonds. A well-written script is not everything, an excellent acting actor helps make this film a cult classic. This film is banned by the critics and the box office and will be appreciated in the coming years. It is now experiencing the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Drivers, but will no doubt be recognized in the future. I am disappointed that no reviewer has recognized Andy Sidaris' branded film. The costumes and the special effects complete this already beautiful piece of film. It is best to ignore the gloomy 3 reviews of this film and go to rent them for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride and the action is better or equivalent to the masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep it up.
