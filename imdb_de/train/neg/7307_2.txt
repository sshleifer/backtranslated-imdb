This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The events are completely random and have little or no sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so sick that I can expect a case of cabin fever (I'M SO SORRY). I describe it as a mistake blurred by a newspaper because it seems as if different parts of things are mixed together. For example, Kevin, the pancake-loving karate kid, is strangely weird, then there's the cop, who's a bit weird and perverted, then the drug addict. Then there is the fact that they are attacking a random guy who definitely needs help. Then the main character suddenly has sex with his girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane that has come down. In the end, there was a good old family racism, followed by a rabbit operating Kevin, the karate kid. It's actually quite despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth. That did not make me like this movie either. Hatred is a strong word, but since it is the only word I can use, it has to do something. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
