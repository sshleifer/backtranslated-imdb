This is one of the heaviest, dullest, most unoriginal and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an appealing film. This is nothing but a continuation of a troublesome series of films trying to achieve the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which in my opinion is the best movie of all. With regard to this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds strolls through the entire movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors are not busy, the car races are obvious Stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many The scenes are boring and lifeless than two To stare at a wall for hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous movie with nothing unique or distinctive.
