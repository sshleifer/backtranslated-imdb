The Minion is about ... a Minion. A servant of Satan whose goal is to receive the key that opens the door in which his master is trapped. He's a kind of demon who owns people, and when the body dies, he'll own another. Anyone who happens to be obsessed will have angry tantrums. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret Order of the Templars who should keep the key away from the Minion. The film begins a thousand years ago in the Middle East, where a few Knights Templar flee from the henchman. Then it goes on until 1999, when the key somewhere in the subway of New York takes place. An archaeologist is instructed to examine the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the Minion is behind the key and the movie becomes a lengthy chase scene between the Minion and Luke and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a B-movie strip on a low budget. The film lacks the energy, and it has just been swept away. They will follow the persecution, but will never feel involved in the story of voluntarily taking ideas from previous films (especially The Terminator movies). The battle scenes with the Minion are laborious, as you never get the impression how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. It becomes "skilled" when fighting against a Templar squad, but it sucks when it comes to single players. And it should be there for a long time. All this shows that every sense of logic is thrown into the drain for the sake of simplicity. The whole idea of ​​a secret Order of the Templars, a door to hell and the key is not well explained. We just have to accept that they only exist. The movie seems to have been made with the feeling that the story does not have much potential, but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wishes he was somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
