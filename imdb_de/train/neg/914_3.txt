(Review in English, as Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and unfortunately I can tell you that it did not do it justice. </ Br>> As much as I loved seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson back on the big screen, the authors should have realized early in the script process that seven people fall into the water, not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are worn and predictable, those that do not exist are just boring. I smiled three times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The placement of the Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign with the statement; "Findus did it!". <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not have to be seen in the cinema or on DVD. Just wait until it is televised. It will not take long.
