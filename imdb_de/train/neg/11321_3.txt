You can not really go far if the initial story is not great. The premise that cyborg needs blood is stupid. <br /> <br /> The script is blas√© '. The actors do not have much to do. The sets were staged in the desert to cut costs. It's a hallmark that when the background is the desert, the movie has no budget. <br/> <br /> A lack of budget is fine if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from no $. But this movie looks like they need to scrap their change together just to buy a sandwich for the cameraman. Again forgivable, if only the story is not just shit. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: It does not end! It just ends up being a commercial departure from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Only strange. <br /> <br /> Bad.
