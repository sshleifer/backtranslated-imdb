Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. It's a typical direct DVD / TV movie that contains all the ingredients needed to create a horrible movie experience: Overacting actors were the secondary steps of the storyline that were not clarified, why ??), people are not reacting to things like in real life. I will not bother you with details, it would last all night. Okay, just one: If two people were killed in front of you when you walked down the street, one of the victims practically died in your arms. His blood is splashing out of his head wound, and your first concern is being; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
