A manipulative drama about a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway) raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) whom she was introduced to by her younger sister (played by the real sister Mariel) whose music teacher he is. While the lawsuit in the central courtroom attracts attention - mainly thanks to a compelling effort by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's attorney - the film is too often merely brilliant, but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury allegedly takes the side of the musician because a) the girl was invited to an attack for the sensual nature of her profession; and b) she offered no resistance to her alleged aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and mistakenly saw the couple in bed together. What the f ***?! She was clearly tied up - what resistance could she realistically offer? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film, which involves Sarandon's rape of the sister and curiously anticipates the IRREVERSIBLE (2002) in a tunnel, is quite imaginative: Mariel's character should have known better than to trust Sarandon afterwards What he did to her sister, but Margaux herself foolishly almost instantly re-establishes the working method that had indirectly led to her humiliating experience! However, the climax of Sarandon's desserts, with Margaux suddenly becoming a fearless and imaginative vigilante, is a crowd-pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); Incidentally, the ubiquitous Italian film mogul Dino De Laurentiis stood behind both films. <br /> <br /> It's worth noting that the lives of the two Hemingway sisters had very different twists (this was the movie debut of both): Margaux's career never came off with (despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here) - while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen's MANHATTAN (1979) and, interestingly enough, herself would be a glamorous victim of raging violence if she saw the role of real life. "Playboy" - middlefelt Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosses STAR 80 (1983) With the added pressure of a few failed marriages, Margaux withdrew into alcohol and died of an overdose of drugs in 1996. The Hemingway family suicidal - especially the grandfather of the Sisters, the writer Ernest, who died in 1961 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
