Lorenzo Lamas plays the lead role as Jack `Solider` Kelly, a veterinarian veteran and a renegade policeman on a mission to save his sister from the backwoods. This horrible movie is so cheap and so poorly made that Ron Palillo has the third prize and still has 3 minutes of screen time, and even these are not good. All in all a horrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree and being gagged are worth a couple of (unwanted) laughs. Followed by an improved sequel.
