I do not know what you are breathing, but please stop. This movie was completely garbage. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was adorable, sweet, cute, affectionate and extremely funny to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong too. <br /> <br /> This new boy, Alex? Annoying as hell! Just a blatant rip-off trying to find Culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably. <br /> <br /> The bad guys, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining screen team. They were comedic, they were humorous and just made you pull more to Culkin, which is what a good villain should do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just bicker and try again to use the charisma and duo charm of the first bad guys. They did not say they were terrible, but they were not memorable or really entertaining. Actually more on the stupid side. Then we got the actual films. Part 1 and 2, classics. Unforgettable. Perfect for watching Christmas brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings so many emotions out. You fall in love with the story and take care of the characters. Simple, memorable and almost masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of manure. Enough said. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not know why people like it. I think people really do not know what a good movie is. It's a crappy sequel to rip-offs with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid I wish the robbers would at least get the crap out of the garbage. And let's not start with Part 4!
