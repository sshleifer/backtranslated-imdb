You have to love the cheesy low-budget movies. This comes complete with bad effects, props and bad drama (really bad). Also, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister), I keep thinking: "Attention! She is a vampire! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad tastes wastes some money and takes a snapshot, the little that was spent, of course I do not know if I'm any more sorry if the author of the film or the producer has not recovered any money. <br /> <br /> I would say it's good for little kids in their simplicity, but I do not know if I want to subdue a child ... um ... 1/10, because that's the lowest it's going to be.
