The Class is a comedy series that features a series of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why I'm saddened that The Class is not funny, even though it has the obvious potential. It's not enough Corky, only Dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and lack of really funny punchlines. Some actors also have difficulty with the timing. <br /> <br /> Most inventive characters are Twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem to be just a bit too square for the show. On the other hand, the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the husbands Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothers me about the series is that Aaron's only Latin-American character is chosen for his accent (though of a disrespectful character, but still).
