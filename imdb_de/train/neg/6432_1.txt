The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a day given to the Senator, who relied on ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft. The rear-facing mobile guns relied on a bolt that would prevent the rear gunner from firing off the rear of the aircraft by preventing the gun from firing when pointing at the stern. One day, when the Senator was practicing on the ground, he managed to shoot down the stern of the plane. He could not have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The responsible officer publicly admitted to a camera that he was responsible - he made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was the PBS special made for him. He was a hard-working, intelligent, ambitious politician who has overcome extraordinary disadvantages to reach extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but it was not one of them to shoot the tail out of a plane. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is based on the fact that the audience likes simple stories, one-sided stories so they do not have to think.
