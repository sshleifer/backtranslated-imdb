In fact it never was. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to re-enact a screwball comedy from the 1940s. What a void confused! None of these people are close to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, and so on, and today's audiences are not so open-minded about this muck. Writing is trivial. The choppy plot is razor-sharp and obvious. The chemistry between the main characters does not exist. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to believe that she is a reincarnation of a great star of the "golden age of Hollywood" whenever possible. It's an effect she tries again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
