I do not think I ever felt disappointed with a movie before. After loving Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I do not count Swept Away - he was blind to the pussy), I was looking forward to seeing this. <br /> <br /> The reviews were bad, then I do not trust the press anyway. Even more worrying was the fact that it was a little stinker on the internet. So, with some discomfort, I had handed over my Â£ 4.80 last night. I will not even try to explain this movie, mainly because I had no idea what was going on, and at some point I was honestly close to getting up and asking if it was only me who did not understand him! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I think that Ritchie is in the trap of his wife, to take too seriously. It does not seem to be good enough for him to make films with good deeds, laughs, dashing dialogues, and good characters. It's almost as if he has a checklist of movies he wanted to tear down, here are some I've noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky .. <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were really good and it was the really pliant story and cut / director that allowed the movie down. <br /> <br /> So a big, big thumb down from me.
