This is one of the worst things ever to come out of England. The tension when we need to find out if Lembach stays or not is amazing. The advantage is that the pretty secretary Sheila is seen for a while in her picnic table underwear, after Dr. med. Rat Face was captured. This movie also has several views of London, though none of them are good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident where the heart rate drops below normal again. There's also a clock being teleported, and the fear that the woman will not get her watch back is just boring and British, in line with the horror of The Sixth Sense. Add a furious firefight between British police and Dr. Ing. Add advice, which does not lead to anything, to the electrocution of many people plus a cat and you have yourself ... um ... a British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, though not among the best.
