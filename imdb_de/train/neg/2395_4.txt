Could this be the same director as Do not Look Now or Bad Timing? Bad <br /> <br /> traded, awkward edited. Just compare the different accident scenes in this area with similar scenes in "Do not Look Now" to see how much Roeg has lost his <br /> <br /> touch. <br /> <br /> Even the generally reliable behavior of Teresa Russell (who looks a bit clunky these days, I'm afraid to report) can not save him. The plot is a pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is made of wood, and Roeg's attempts to change the time shift of his brand are pitiful.
