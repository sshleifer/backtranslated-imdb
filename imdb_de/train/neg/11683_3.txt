Three storylines and not enough joined together, "Inside Man" was very restless and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Although the film had its moments, it looked like a fast-paced thriller that moved quickly to a slow crawl, jumped fast between highs and lows, and barely gained momentum in the last 20 minutes. I acknowledge Denzel Washington, he played his role very well, with a full understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality as a "bad genius" and a "criminal thinker" (both are not equal in retrospect). Overall, each person has created its own subsection. But when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or sum of everything. It all ended up with very little energy, with many hand holes, tons of questions, and as I said, near Spike Lee's normal level. I absolutely do not have to agree with the so-called "professional critics".
