Whatever I give BOOM is only because of the excellent location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (their down phase) and RICHARD BURTON (his abuse phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train stops here" and is said to like this adaptation of his game - but apparently he was the only one. Taylor supposedly hated it and Burton needed the money. Anyway, it's a hill full of beans, in which Taylor smokes in her flashy manner, explodes at the servants and makes bad talk with no less than NOEL COWARD, who seems to be a visitor another movie is when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It's so tough it's probably a must-see thing among Taylor fans. But if you can handle this without a drink in your hand, you are far ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is the movie that marks the end of Taylor, who was taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally devastating and was referred to by the critics as BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
