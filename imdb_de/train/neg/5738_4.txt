"Darkness" was entertaining to a degree, but there never seemed to be a conspiracy more lacking than in other films accused of this disadvantage; i.e. "bad taste". It started really well with a man running in front of something. It was very scary for the first few minutes, but after some time, the movie became entertaining on the Gore plane, which was hard to spot in some places due to poor lighting and awful recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe, because the youth looked like young friends who talked to a video camera and formed a few rows. Without any action, it made it seem as though the film had begun and ended without a script of any kind. As mentioned before, Gore was the only drawing point of this film, which was hard to see most of the time.
