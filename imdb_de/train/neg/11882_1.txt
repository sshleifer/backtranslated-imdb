I passed the shelf a few times and looked at the myriad of big positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front, wondering if I was missing something. Recently it was in one of the movie channels and I agreed. I did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only saw the first 30 minutes. Maybe then the movie becomes a comedy gold. In the face of the slow, clumsy tempo and the total lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character begins the film in the classic style "I do not know how to start my film", with a long, tiresome monologue about not wanting to be sued. It is not funny. It is not even funny. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little giggle when he says it for the first time. Then he drags it into the ground and smiles into the camera as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Overcome yourself. I think the conversation with the camera was the reason why I did not like the movie right away. Do not assume to be familiar with your audience. Familiarity is _ learned_, much like respect. <br /> <br /> Basically, you have a big, weepy guy talking in a very efficient way about his boring life as a tempo. I did not know he was a Jew. It is a discrediting of Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor". It's just listless humor. Just because you're a Jew does not mean that you know the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does the self-analytical humor better than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. If any of the parts I had seen worked, I might have stayed. But some of the fuss that talks about how he loves the names of the women he works with and then performs for five minutes does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Do not let yourself be victimized by Target Marketing. Just say "haiku tunnel".
