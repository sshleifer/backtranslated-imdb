A comedy with a note that is likely to marginalize modern feminists these days. Betsy Drake, a department store merchant, is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage. She puts her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super bait in the form of the slender bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the movie varies from one trick to the next as ruthless Drake pursues her quarry. I think the word "cheeky" is about improving Drake's approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes memorizing her dentures, I started overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and without his usual flair. However, there is one scene that almost saves this slim exercise. Drake asks the unfortunate Grant after his speech in front of a room full of decent ladies. Here, her cheeky nature has an informal freshness that is truly remarkable, and if the production had not rubbed our nose for 90 minutes in that sullen smile, the movie might have more than a girl's daydream for girls (around 1948).
