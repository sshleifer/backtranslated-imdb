Although there is a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'succubus' is often referred to as THE best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts "Succubus" among his personal favorites. Maybe it's me, but I thought that was a terribly boring and confusing movie. The opening is great and shows Janine Reynaud doing an SM act on stage. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from here. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills his lover in a kind of trance. Franco had a reasonable budget to work with and spends well with beautiful locations, beautiful photographs and fascinating music. This COULD was indeed his best film, if not for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic, but I'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what is going on or what exactly is said, even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last forever. This is certainly not Franco's best movie. I would not even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. If you're looking for a better Jess Franco movie, try grabbing Las Vampiras, The Terrible Dr. Orloff, or Female Vampires.
