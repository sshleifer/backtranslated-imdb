I tried watching this movie during an overseas mission in a military camp, and I tell you, you see everything under these circumstances. Not this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes were the reason for the play to set the tone with weak porn movies, sinister plot twists and incredible situations and behaviors. After that it gets worse. This movie does not have a single escape, yet it's not so bad it's funny to look at it. It's just awful. I've seen quite a few movies in my life and I'm not one of those crappy critics. I mean, I'll enjoy most movies to a degree, even if they're bad. This man. <br /> <br /> Stand clear _well_, my friend.
