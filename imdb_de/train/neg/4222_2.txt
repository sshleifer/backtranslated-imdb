For those of us who spent these weeks of shooting in the city and in the valley - not to forget the boring days of road closure and "filmmaking". In memory of those who live here: locations like Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport and Big Basin. etc. The bank was the firehouse in BC. The chases included Moon Drive off Highway 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the easiest to reach, Matt Broderick was above all of us - even then. As for the movie - a joke about a script and an even bigger laugh about acting and acting - but who cares? A nice time capsule for those who enjoy our coastal and valley landscape. <br /> <br /> Additional comments; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the movie), the movie's original name was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba's car park was the marketplace, the backyard footage was on Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn off the hat and see some actors in their early days.
