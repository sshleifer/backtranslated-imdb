Do not get me wrong, I love action and revenge stories. I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest The Mechanics, which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera, and it could even be a genius to shoot and edit movies. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his "ingenious" filmmaking skills intelligently, he uses them debt-free to lack substance show and compensate that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is almost two and a half hours, if it should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott filmed and edited this movie makes you wonder if he really wants you (sitting the audience because his permanent camera is constantly moving and flashing is one Agony for the eye and you have to leave the theater or switch off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> At times The MPAA and the studios have questionable attitudes regarding rating, violence and making PG-13 films also find it suspicious that a $ 70 million movie consists of a B-movie script whose character cuts fingers and puts a man in the ass blowing a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to the death of one to avenge little girl who is not even dead! Then figure out why a studio has a better script because of the language or the violence ... So it is said ...
