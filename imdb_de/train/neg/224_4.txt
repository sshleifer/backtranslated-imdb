The worst thing about Crush is not that it was pretty bad or that the plot does not exist, and it's not even so bad that the camera work could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst There are some absolutely brilliant moments in this film, in which you hope that more will follow. <br /> <br /> But in the end it is too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap scenes, where 40 women cry and hug and talk about babies and marriage, then you should not miss it. <br /> <br /> I'm not myself I was really excited to see the above things in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty terrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. I wasted my time. <br /> <br />
