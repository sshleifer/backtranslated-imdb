In the beginning, after outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates) turns out to be a self-rapist, another 1930s bandit is cornered in a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. Second Deputy Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) surveys the situation, puts a burning cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded Caliber .45 and walks alone into the faraway house. Bang bang bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house and carries the female hostage, the villain, who is dead. Everything in the distance. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have a significant appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's just as exciting as mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his death dramatically. Multiple violations of the citizens code. Many firefights with Tommy pistols and pistols. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> As a story, it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part I'd guess he was called that. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who dismissed Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in search of public attention. <br /> <br /> The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who has anchored in his contract that if an animal is shot in one of his productions, he should be the shooter. Milius is the guy, a complete weapon geek, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War with quotes from Henry V - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew that I would never take him alive, and I did not try too hard." That is, kill them all and let God fix them. <br /> <br /> You will just love it.
