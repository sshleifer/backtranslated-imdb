RKS movies have always been commercial movies that fit the 90s, by GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His latest films that KHAKEE showed were more expandable <br /> <br /> The problem This is because many old-fashioned clich√©s are thrown in and many scenes seem too cinematic and tedious. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan's character is shown very well, but his character becomes heroic, which could be subtle. <br /> <br /> The long flashback could be avoided as sausages are simply pulled out. <br /> <br /> The street game in the second half seems too simple and hardly a solution The message is well established <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is decent, although it could be better. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks and plays his role very well Mostly he sometimes looks uncomfortable in light scenes. He is characterized by his drama. Vidya excels in the scene. Pankaj has an undefined role and is too cinematic The Darshan Jariwala ham is characterized by its old rogue, the rest is okay
