Where should I start? <br /> <br /> # 1 The son of Amitabh, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. Amitabh has been in jail for over 33 years ... he <br /> <br /> A) telepathic transmitted the semen home? <br /> <br /> B) A nice Pakistani guard was asked to send it for him? <br /> <br /> C) You allow marital visits in secret Pakistani prisons <br /> D) All the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers had a bit too much time at <br /> < br /> when they approved the script. # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he's yummy, yummy, yummy ... and apparently he wants her - who would not, right ?! ... but when her dad gets ripped off and then killed (I hardly believe that this is a "spoiler" because you would have to be brain dead and blind to not see that in the movie). He is quite emotionless about this catastrophe and with the (metaphorical) tip of his hat, leaves her to save his father, does not care about her loss and says (paraphrases) "If God wants it, we will see each other again" .. Basically that means "I'm going to make my dad do MY job, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!" - callus beyond Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) In this terrible waste of time called film, there are so many holes that you can drive all the jeeps. Trucks, camels and other stuff. Pass - really, completely and totally a waste of time - Oh, there's a great dance sequence (yes, just one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) - great belly dance - but NOT worth it Just for those purposes. <br /> <br /> Are you renting Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (does Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict films ... Actually Veer-Zaara is damn good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
