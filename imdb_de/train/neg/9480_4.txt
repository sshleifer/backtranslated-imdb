I have just watched this movie. In a word: sucky! The story is bad, the acting is, if possible, even worse. The movie has one or two nice moments, but that's it, and having those two little good moments makes up for nothing, before or after those moments. A cruelty of a movie that is not even worth watching on TV ...
