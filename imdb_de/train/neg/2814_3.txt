1. watched 26.08.2001 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, but sadistic (which makes sense), which depicts a relative of the Marquis de Sade doing the same sadistic deeds and doing it allegedly pleased his predecessor Tobe Hooper's movie does not really differ from his similar Freddy Krueger films with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund), who plays a dual role (the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It also seems as if it really wants to poke against Christianity, but then loses much to my regret in the end, but leaves an inconsistent feeling in the film. It could have been much worse if excesses were done on sex and violence, but they try to minimize this despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper wanted to do this movie. It obviously took a while before he was actually distributed. Then he had to be cruelly advertised with the name of Hooper in the title to hopefully earn something with his name and his blood. It is obvious that this did not work.
