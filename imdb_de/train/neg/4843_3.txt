Well, I too had heard reading all those breathless reviews and comments about how this movie earned the Best Picture Oscar, so I saw it today. What a big disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from members of the US military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflected my own thoughts. When the movie was played, I - a complete civilian - always thought of myself: "Say, WHAT? That's not how it would happen." 2) There is very little that actually happens about the conspiracy. A new man to dispose of bombs appears to replace the one killed (a death that is not really clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude endangers others. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is not nearly as exciting as claimed. If you want excitement, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to watch a war movie that is emotionally emotional, rent Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told STAFF in a chance supermarket encounter that he's a movie) which he is immensely proud of, and one he considered to be one of his best works, and that he was still angry, had been largely ignored after the overheated Apocalypse (Now Now Now) The English movie is unbelievably heartbreaking - do not waste your time on Hurt Locker.
