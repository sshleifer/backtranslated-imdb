A young scientist is trying to continue his dead father's work on limb regeneration. His arrogant mother has convinced him that he has murdered his own father and monitors his progress for his own evil purposes. Creature and when his arm is easily torn off a few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and lets a new murderous arm grow Granted, the special effects in "Severed Ties" are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the film The severed arm behaves like a snake and kills few people. Great deal. The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3 out of 10 points.
