What the ........... is that? This is undoubtedly the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. I know you can not set your expectations for a slasher high of 80, but that's too stupid to be true. I bought this movie for $ 0.89 and still feel the need to get my money back. Can you imagine who keeps it tough? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are his motivations ??? Well, you really could not care less. And why should you? For sure, the creators of this garbage did not care. You have not tried to build a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it is much easier to find money with such a name) also made the Kindred (1986), which was quite pleasing and recently made Soul Survivors. Complete crap too, but at least one had Eliza Dushku. This garbage has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yes that's right, the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after the opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies right in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him later. Who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not really deserve the term actor, are completely uninteresting. They hope they die a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters. <br /> <br /> My modest opinion = 0/10
