Although it is not as bad as it was made (I have seen MUCH worse), this is still a very lame movie. Essentially a remake of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff," with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than Joe Don Baker, an ugly actor, if there is one, is great (and a lot of fun) than evil, a kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit down in the steam, since the rest of the cast mostly gives terrible acting, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe that he once was a romantic leader (see "Mondo Cane" to see him run away from the women). He looks like a second Ben Gazzara here and has virtually nothing to do. It's all Joe Dons show, unfortunately. And all this to an "80s" action movie music that could not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good B-movies ("Without Warning"), but here he stumbles, falls down, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the places in Malta were nice and there are Venantini trying to save the day. 10.3.
