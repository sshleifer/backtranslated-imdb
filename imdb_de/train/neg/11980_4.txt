This was marred by potentially great matches that were very short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I think the only way to beat it off was a DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have had to work overtime. Kerry of Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And this was the third ppv in a row in which Perfect was jobbed. Remember, he had never lost a match before. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights and nailed the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to survive a new heel (remember the Big Bossman and yokozuna?). This was a taste of Bret Hart's career when he returned from Two-on-One and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase have set up a wrestling clinic that lets us forget that DiBiase's boring feud with Dusty Rhodes was the point of the game. <br /> <br /> Although the visionaries were the first team to survive all members (and only the second since '87 (four survivors), this match was not squash.) This was the longest game of the night, and Jake repeated his performance of '88 when he was left alone and dominated against four men, I think he could have really gotten worked up, nowadays the game would have ended up reversed. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS games Tito Santana, probably the most underrated wrestler of all time, was the inspirational wrestler of the night, he put on war paint and put Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the warlord in the final battle for survival. Sgt. Slaughter also did well to get rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but that was no surprise g. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival fight was that Hogan and the Warrior win together in the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the matches were also short. The Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason why I will remember it.
