For a good half hour, I remember thinking, "Hey, that could be Bill Rebane's best performance ever!". The opening sequences are atmospheric, there are some frightening moments right away, and our director even points out his own infamous stinker "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept was shamelessly stolen from William Castle's House on Haunted Hill. Three old and extremely bored millionaires lured nine losers into an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in a knockout game. Of course, the participants disappear quickly, one after the other, and it takes too long for the remaining greedy philistines to realize that either the old people are sadists ... or there is another killer among them. The film starts and ends with a strange narrator telling a lot of pointless things that are not relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there are a few nice T & A that you can admire in the first ten minutes and this one Stupid Bimbo (Shelly, I think she called) is really fun to watch. Of course, after the first half hour, the inevitable happens, and "The Cold" becomes a textbook rebel production with delayed plot twists, the dumbest dialogues of all time, and total excitement. There was no budget for bloody murders, but our talented director (?) Tries to compensate for this with endless recordings of disco dance girls and an amateur rock band. The movie also has four or even five different highlights and none of them is a little satisfactory. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: the return of the king? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
