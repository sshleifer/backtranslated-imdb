I can not believe that such crooked, jingoistic materials as art house material are passed on to the Americans. From the very beginning, such slogans as "We want to make sure they play for the right team" and manipulative design and lighting, A Love Divided shows that it's his true face. The stark way in which Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemony, the Protestants as peaceful and dejected, is a poor representation of history like the early westerns of the United States, which represent the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted by the stereotypes and utter denigration of Irish Catholics in the story. a corruption known by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still believe that they can gain a moral influence by making a film so easily recognizable that it is obvious, so far from trying art. This movie has no business in a legitimate movie theater or library.
