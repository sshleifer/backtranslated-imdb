This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon, we see depictions of extreme abuses of animals, including the literal riding IN SLOW MOTION. The man who did this has spiritually cleansed his conscience from the flames of the burial / burning of the horse, which of course is still dead and tortured to death. This is one of the sickest, slimmest movies I've ever seen. When Gene Hackman and James Coburn are near the finish line in their DYING animals, we should admire their spirits for the end of the race. I would like to take part in a marathon for the producers and the director. I'll decide when they're done, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
