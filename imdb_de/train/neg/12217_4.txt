As cheap indies go, you'll usually find you're getting what you pay for, and I'm just saying I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... Author / Director: David R Williams tells us the story of a deserted amusement park, besieged by the vengeful ghost of a serial killer killed. Not a bad premise, but executed with a plethora of low budget mistakes. The camera work tries to be hacked for the audience by constantly using shaky cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. This shows up from the beginning, as we get to know the would-be killer and soon realize that (acting) is the scariest thing that happens ... After a painfully long title sequence, we are still brought back to modern times, the action remains the same. "Frightworld" creates a pretty unique movie backdrop when you show scenes from the fun house, but with an extremely long running time, the movie can not be saved from its average indie hell. <br /> <br /> There is a mediocre nudity, but not much for Gore, which is usually the salvation of this type of movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of really bad B-movies might find something interesting here, otherwise they will not spend a lot of money.
