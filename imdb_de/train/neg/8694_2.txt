The female lead was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first went to the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have suspected the police. I would have been heartbroken in the same situation. She seemed very calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the role better. And it would have earned a lot more money for such a controversial, important topic. Everyone else was excellent. I do not know where the lead actress is, but I hope she got acting lessons.
