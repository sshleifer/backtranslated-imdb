This film is by no means a conversation, but rather a deep look into the deepest areas of human behavior. Loose connection of half a dozen stories about the worst types of corruption, perverse sex, greed, violence and intolerance. During a heatwave in Vienna, the action is played on a couple of very hot and sticky days, and the heat may be responsible for the anger and hatred in the movie. For me, the treatment of the backward girl by the seller of the safety equipment was about the worst episode, followed closely by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the apartment "Mud". They are packed and I hope that this movie is horrified. I hated it, but I felt compelled to go through it. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 for "man" as he sometimes is.
