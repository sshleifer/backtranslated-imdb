It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the topics and the main story, which was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and lack of the ability to govern everything. Acting was okay to cheesy, some were stronger than others, and even the stronger actors had less good acting times. It took me a few months to get through the movie because it did not grab my attention and the river was just bad. I've just finished it and I'm glad I did when the movie finally got moving and ended up with some continuity. Again a good story, but the delivery was below average. I would recommend it for the story and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean, a bit.
