After looking at this thing, I read the summary on the back of the DVD and then thought back to the actual movie .... I got a bit dizzy. I thought maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a Down Syndrome baby, rolling through a never-ending forest where people travel 11 miles an hour and stop for no reason other than the occasional tasteless Lesianism. Where (zombies?) Coming out of nowhere and (vampires?), The (purebred) citizens (seducing?) On their way to save the world? Neither zombie nor vampire meet strangely. The only fight I remember was to take off this walrus suit of the walnut Bonny Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe that's because we looked at the widescreen and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining ... In the end, my postulated thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, Subject matter and then the entirety of this film. Bloodrayne looked like Citizen F *** ING KANE
