... for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard with which all C ** P now need to be compared. <br /> <br /> At first, the beginning had elements of style ... If it could be handled well, it could have become a cult classic, an a la pulp fiction or a desi desperado ... but the plot (was there a?) begins to meander and loses it at one point completely Throw a confused Don with an obsession for English, a call center Smart Alec, a woman wearing a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb , a hovering, gravity-defying hit-man and a police officer with a hundred (or a thousand) black cat commandos on the trail ... good ingredients in competent hands. But here I want to ask the director: Sir, what did you smoke? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this film will be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film production - for what never has to be done - an insult to the intelligence of most brain deaths by moviegoers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only salvation feature in this Desi Matrix plus Desperado Plus Grindhouse caper is the music ... watch the videos ... hear the airplay and you will not be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar has some excellent buzz. <br /> <br /> I wish the director had spent the money on creating more eye candy. <br /> <br /> If I want to unsubscribe, I really want to know how Akshay's really doing bullet wound disappears in a microsecond ... what did you do? Tashan, maybe ...
