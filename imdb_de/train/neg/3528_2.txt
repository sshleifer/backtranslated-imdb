There are so many comments on this film, but I found it misleading. This is an exaggerated scenario in which a normal person, for obvious reasons, becomes a partner of the opposite sex. Boy meets girl. Girl considers boy at gunpoint ridiculous. Boy is fascinated. <br /> <br /> You know the exercise: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free mind instead of a sociopath ... Take some words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy is 'crazy or just needs a hug?' The role of The Breakfast Club simply stinks as a protagonist. And all that's left is a really gruesome turkey in a movie.
