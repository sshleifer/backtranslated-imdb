OK, here it is: "Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama." What we do is, first we get a big star who has no idea how he sets a Germanic accent, and we let him flit for over two hours between French, German, American and British. Then we put together a series of unlikely events and leave them far apart so that the plot is almost imperceptible in centimeters. But just to make sure that the viewer can not fall asleep, we throw in details that are terrifyingly absurd, like our hero who smokes a cigarette at 22,000 feet. Of course, we also need to remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles. Therefore, every character, even the lowest peasant in the forbidden closed city of Lhasa from 1943, speak perfect English, even with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is dealing with the spiritual and political aspects of the story. So what we do is this: We made the Dalai Lama friends with the now reformed Nazi, because he can play around so well with movie projectors, radios, vintage cars and all other devices represent the freedom of the capitalist West. In return, our hero learns from his young protégé a kind of indistinct, undefined Buddhism that is never really brought out or treated seriously. We also have many scenes in which the hero displays all the signs of respect and protocol that the rest of Tibetan society concedes to the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has a deep and deep reverence for these people and her spiritual leader. In other words, we only expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist in his own way, even though we do not know ourselves what his transformation means and how far he wants. And last but not least, at the end of the film, we attach a statistic of how horribly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans (which is certainly true), blaming us for making a "political" film, it's nothing like that , Zat is my idea. Dad are you zincing? Can I make a movie?
