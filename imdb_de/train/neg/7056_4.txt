This movie is a great example of how some very funny jokes can go horribly wrong. I really expected at least some of this movie after seeing the add-on that was funny as hell, but the movie was not half as good the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I know not who this film is to blame. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors)) and gavelins (actresses) and not even the funny kind 2) The director 3) The guy, the actor and / or the director occupied. If you are really bored and really see this movie, or get a copy of it Any ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt, because this will be a lot funnier than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only salvation of this film is Mahesh Manjrekar and the funny Chappu Bhai
