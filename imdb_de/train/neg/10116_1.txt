I honestly want to go back the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who can see this movie, is Helen Keller. I used to say that this had to get better. This needs to get better. <Br /> <br /> Then finally appeared the zombies and they had little raccoon color on her eyes. <br /> <br /> They talked like normal people. <br /> <br /> You drove a car. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo women asked what one of the "Zombies" and wanted to "Zombie" said (I like to dance) <br /> <br /> (THAT WAS IT) The film I came I Can not take longer Can I sue for half an hour of my life ?????
