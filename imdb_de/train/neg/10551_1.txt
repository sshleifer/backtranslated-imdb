Apparently, The Mutilation Man is a man who roams the country and shows shows of self-mutilation to cope with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because the viewer, with no idea of ​​a comment by director Andy Copp (whom I did not have for myself) or read the film before watching, has no idea what it is about. <Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be tempted to see The Mutilation Man with the promise of some tough scenes of splatter and unsettling real-world footage, unless they're also interested in presumptuous headaches, an experimental art-house cinema, they It is a real task to sit through it. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images, accompanied by inappropriate sounds, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, and this head is unconscious.
