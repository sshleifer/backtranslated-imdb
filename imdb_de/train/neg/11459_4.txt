Whale hunters attack the wrong, crazy whale. <br /> <br /> A group of Yahoo Whale exploiters catches a woman and rips her by the tail. The companion of the whale sees the whole thing, including the moment when the woman's unborn baby slips out and falls onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could say that the big man is really angry when he stares at him, as if to say, "Leave the city before the flood." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bos beauty, but not much else. This was Bos's first "released" film, although her first acting job four years earlier had appeared in "Once Upon a Love" (1981) as "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time ... gets it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
