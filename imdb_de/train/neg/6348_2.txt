Extremely presumptuous nonsense. The material is boring, boring and boring, and most of the actors would not even have made a subset in Allen's earlier films. And if I have to hear how Will Ferrell imitates his imitation of Woody Allen, I have to detest even the second-rate (albeit mysteriously beloved) Ferrell even more. It seems as though grumpy 70-year-old Allen had stopped work when the clock rang in a new century. I was really trying to get involved in the movie, but it was just impossible; My snyapses could not fire so slowly. Instead of falling asleep and killing the afternoon in an upright position asleep, I got up, leaving my wife and daughter in the theater, and went to the car, where I had a really good book to read again (George Bailey's great volume 30 years ago, "Germans.") The day went well, no thanks to Woody.
