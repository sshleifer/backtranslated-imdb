A cheap and stunningly boring story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the Blooper role provided with the DVD showed how incompetent the actors were and how little fun they had. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically spurious, and the antagonists were not scary or credible. The "homoerotic" overtones were pointlessly tame and unsatisfactory, confining themselves to young boys caressing their breasts while slack in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little bit of action would have kept me and my girlfriend awake at least.
