I have seen Phat Beach via cable for a while and I liked it somehow. The fat guy is the best character, he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the figures are just different stereotypes of young men and young blacks. I like watching those low-budget movies that capture a certain amount of time, because they are almost like a documentation of the settings and fashions of the year. Phat Beach is also fun because the low-budget girls in this movie are just maids. Most low-budget films have the quality of "local," and the babes in this film were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite on their bikinis that it was funny to see the "youngsters" getting wild, which was actually an overused, high profile prostitute. There were also some sweets. That's the charm of these humble low-budget movies. You will see many puppies and some real sweetness! I've reviewed some of these at IMDb, and seven years later Phat Beach is the only loan. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone had ever managed to write a book about "Where are they now" to all the cuties who have appeared in the history of the movies and would never return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot to offer, and if you watch the movie on TV years later, ask yourself, "What happened to X?" Anyway, this movie usually blows, but it has some funny moments.
