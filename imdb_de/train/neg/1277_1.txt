This movie still annoys me when I think about it. Not only was this movie bad in low budget, poorly played, etc., though it certainly was all of those things. The problem with this movie is that it was apparently deliberately trying to annoy the viewer, and with great success. What I want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely awful, but not the way horror movies are supposed to be. I could see how the first segment tried to be horror and fail, but what is the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like an artistic student film that surprisingly makes it the least painful segment. It is an atrocity that this movie is not among the 100s, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know that some people gave these good reviews, but they lie in a sadistic attempt to trick you. Trust me, it's impossible to like this movie. The only advantage of this film is an amazing, life-prolonging effect: it feels like you've watched this movie years after the first half hour.
