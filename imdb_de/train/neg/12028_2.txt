I agree with everyone who has said something that will convince you not to pass the moment when you see this amazingly amateurish movie. Very bad appearance, uncomplicated production values, absolutely pedestrian guidance and a script that is so incapable and indecent that it should never be written or even produced. Even the "professionals" from Hollywood seem to work only for a paycheck, although nobody should be paid for this bad work. Careers should instead be FINISHED over this unruly fool. <br /> <br /> OTH, it's something fascinating to see something so breathtaking bad. And Chad Lowe is terrible and consistently bad.
