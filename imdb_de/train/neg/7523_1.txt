Once again, I took the opportunity and rented this garbage bag. Billed as a horror movie, there was no scene, none that scared even from afar. NOT ONE !! Sure, there was some nudity, but the lesbian action got a bit old. I suppose maybe that was the saving grace of this movie? And Dan, what an annoying bag! I knew from the beginning that I wanted it when good old Dan spoke first. And he should be intimidating? To laugh! All in all, this movie is terribly awful! How the hell are films like this made? If you want a movie with some thrills, you can not rent it. This movie is as exciting as the Teletubbies.
