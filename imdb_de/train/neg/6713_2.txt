But this movie was boring. The historical part was good, but not the musical part. No song that interested me, and no soundtrack to be heard. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "should be seen as comic relief, it never works, if John Adams is considered annoying annoying, the rest." They tried to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their history The context was interesting enough, but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. <br /> <br /> If you do not humming the songs for a musical, unless you've only twittered a few times, nothing else is worth the breath.
