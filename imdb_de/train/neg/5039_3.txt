Rex Reed once said of a movie ("Julia and Juliet," to be exact) that it looked like he was shot through pomegranate juice. I was reminded when I snored through Purple Butterfly. This movie seemed to be shot through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring, and it did not help that the actors' faces were literally out of focus for the actors or would take time to focus on for a while. <br /> <br /> They all looked the same, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. I call this the "Dead Poets Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to care about that nobody cared about dramatically, and the film did not provide any historical light on a very interesting period of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
