Siskel & Ebert were great on this show, whether you agreed with them or not. Roeper recorded this show once or twice because he was not a film critic and because he replaced the opinions of respondents. Well, when Ben Lyons comes, I feel like I see "Teen News" - do you know that children's news programs are being moderated by children for children? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that during their entire life they have only met a constant diet of mainstream movies. The idea that these two rank amateur amateurs have something interesting or consequence to say about films is ridiculous. If you review a movie without a prescription, you are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just think it's "confusing". Wait - I think I understand ... ABC is Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were lucky in the big budget studio productions, what a surprise: These two LOVE the big studio shock and only manage to tolerate a few indies. In addition, everyone knows which age group TV advertisers are looking for. Crass nepotism is the icing on the cake. In which alternative universe do these guys qualify as film critics?
