It's not just the plot that immediately distracts this movie for a bored audience. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes it too torturous to watch. I'm sorry, but I do not see the "fun" in it. Just the thrill of showing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. I wonder how stupid the directors think of their production company when this film was first introduced. Probably as stupid as this sheriff, who crashed into the antifreeze-filled pickup with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention that the sheriff is not just a poor actor, but can shake off a split with a lot of antifreeze that wets the exposed meat? I think he somehow forgot it when he won a not so exciting victory over the snowman.
