Nobody, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" is an excellent example. Although she sometimes over-subscribes to the role, watch her as she ponders how Raliegh writes the lyrics to a song her waiting ladies will play. In that one moment, she lets us understand how Elizabeth could absolutely govern and govern! At other times she is accomplished by the sappiness of the screenplay. If Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she seems weak and timid. This has the added effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to spread justice, it's hard to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn radiates charm and lets us see how Essex could manage Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally unable to convey the complexity and horrible evil of the man. It also does not help that Essex is badly drawn. Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen - even if he swears allegiance - except that he is more blue blooded and thus more "worthy"? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her letters and Essex? He has no risk of disgrace, and we know where Essex (and his head) will go. So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the money he got? He does not even bother to hide the fact that his battle scenes are being shot on a soundstage. He should have finished it alone at The Tower with Elizabeth the first time; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And am I, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
