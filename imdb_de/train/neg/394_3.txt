I rejoice to films that fill gaps in the world cinema. After watching the trailer for "Water Lilies," I expected this movie to be liked because I thought I'd come across something unique: a movie that honestly depicts the lesbian love of teenagers - a kind of female version of " Beautiful Thing ". <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French women who are 15 years old. Marie is slim, reserved, and pretty in a tomboy fashion; Floriane is open-minded, athletic and beautiful. and Anne is loyal, dumpy and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelation between Marie and Floriane always seethes in this film, if not on the surface, then directly below it. <br /> <br /> However, "Water Lilies" is not about having lesbian love for two teens; It's about sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, teenagers who work for different purposes, and at least two times joyless, mechanical sex. It also proves that scriptwriters and filmmakers abuse their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the additional features of the DVD "Lord of the Flies," says director Peter Brook, French cynicism begins with the arousal of sex "means that the French consider children as angels while they are teenagers and Part of the downfall of this film is the filmmaker Celine Sciamma, who swallowed a mighty dose of that cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" I was wondering when I saw this Yes, the first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be happy and triumphantly erotic, in a fresh, life-affirming way - these positive aspects are missing in this film. There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be a poignant celebration of first love, but Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and her cleverness and ruins the film: First, what's the point, just the fat girl naked to show? I know that there is an established tradition of tasteful teenage nudity in European cinema, like movies like "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil"; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pere "and Europe"; But this case is a small authoritarian intervention - "Look, audience, I can make a movie where I just show the unattractive human act." Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity was an honest path. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance. What follows next is not just Floriane, who cynically manipulates Marie; It is the filmmaker Sciamma who cynically manipulates his audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane Marie warns that she wants to demand something that is "not normal". Understandably, Marie asks, "Who cares to be normal?" Then Sciamma plays wrong with her audience and the moving dynamics of the film, because Florianes request is a wrong, rejected and replacing question - not the authentic, heartfelt question of the film, Marie's character and the spectators who have earned their time. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that get on the nerves of the observer: 1) Since when do the French bathe in bathing suits and with a turtle? 2) Which teenager - of any nationality - would plunge into an apple-seed thrown in the trash to taste the lover's mouth? <br /> <br /> The three leading actresses are promising and if you find better carriers for their talents and become great actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is technically the best actress and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a leading actress or a bomb or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has an intensity and a magnetism that are unmistakable. In the future, she could play anything from an emotionally crippled librarian, to a mysteriously sensual seductress, to a reluctant politician who enthusiastically embarks on a meteoric rise. All in all, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. Will an honest filmmaker make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No - not necessarily for this middle-aged man - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality to watch and identify with. And yes, to close a thematic gap in world cinema.
