Anyone who has seen Comedy Central at midnight in recent years has probably seen ads for this movie. In 2001 I first saw ads for this movie. It looked like it might be funny, but I did not want to retrieve the number on the TV screen and order it without first seeing the movie. I thought I would wait until the movie was available at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was a copy of this movie on Tower Records and in the "DVDS for less than $ 20" heaps. When I saw that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I came home, put the DVD in the DVD player and waited for the laughter to start ... and I waited a bit longer. The laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with almost all the other comments on this page when I say that this movie was awful. THE UNERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is sick, desperately tasteless and poorly written and staged. He is a gruesome garbage and in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No stars.
