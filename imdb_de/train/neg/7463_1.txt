I swore a long time ago, NEVER watch a movie in which ANYONE Who EVER is a permanent member of Saturday Night Live. I did not rent "Corky Romano", but I was forced to watch it for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Effortless, not funny. Bad, not good That's all I can say for this video.
