Oh my. How can they make films of such beauty, but they are so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do a crap. There is not even a hint of a decent story, complex characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of pointless chatter that's put together into a "movie." I suspect that only children under the age of 3 could enjoy it, since the world is so gross and the history so incoherent that it would annoy older people. On the other hand, for anyone under the age of six, it's far too scary that there's probably no one who should ever see this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better story, and though she's probably not capable of drawing such pretty pictures, her narrative is much more rewarding. And please, on behalf of the one you believe in, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I give 2 out of 10 points, and that's all for the graphics, because the story and character development are so horrible they deserve a negative rating ... remember I warned you.
