After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about a minute. Nothing for a minute, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two college friends go to a rock concert. After much padding, they hit something and slip off the road. They wake up in a cabin with an old woman in a wheelchair and her offspring. The murders are unfortunately very tame for an alleged video Nasty. The phrase ends silly and predictable. No one involved in the mess would ever make anything remarkable again. So there are still happy ends. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless and Laurel Munson has full frontality <br /> <br /> My Note: D
