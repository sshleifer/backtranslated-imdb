As a longtime fan of all Star Trek series, I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" with Will Riker's exploits is both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and the death of one Teammates) was a money-saving device, as were many of their "bottle shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) had for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski, deserves a better degree than this. Loyal spectators (in the Star Trek world, is there any other way?) Were also running out. This was the last episode of the second season; So the season ended "not with a bang", but with "a whimper".
