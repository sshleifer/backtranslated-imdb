This movie was pretty absurd. There were a few funny parts. It goes straight to the filing of movies in my memory, where I think, "Hmm ..... this movie had some funny parts, but overall a pretty ridiculous action (or a lack of)." <br /> <br /> I thought it seemed Ben was trying a little too hard to be a naughty funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a self-educated multimillionaire and still an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He messes up, but I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was all his fault, I like him all in all. I guess he's a bit like the kid you have to apologize for, because it just does not work. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this streak. It did not really turn into a workable thing, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not being used as well as they could have been. You deserve better. Overall, this movie is NOT home alone, it's not a Christmas story, neither Christmas holiday nor any other classic. Forever unforgettable.
