The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is not mine. This really must be one of the worst movies, in addition to "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. Bad actors and a really bad story. There are no normal reactions to an event in this film, and even if it is Halloween, ordinary people would have greater response if they witnessed the death of their father, let alone people with tape that covers their respiratory tract and can not breathe (in one) I could add a room with at least 50 people) and a person dressed as Satan who carries dead people out of his home, even an 8-year-old would recognize the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that nobody could be so naive and stupid as to believe in the reality of Satan's and Jesus' apparitions the same day as this child. When I was eight, I'm sure I had more sense than that. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be equally interested in this dumb devil, no questions asked. The question in the whole movie is: Is it really Satan or is it a crazy person who killed people whenever they feel like it? Well, he's got human hands, arms, and whatever, so I think he should be in the movie as well, otherwise they've done a lousy job to hide him. Since this human was human, he was able to kill an old woman, a man and his lover, 5 (!! ???) police officers (all with weapons and training I suspect) and a few other people. .... and obviously everyone just stood there waiting for him or something? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen and I would never recommend anyone who wastes 1 hour and 30 minutes of his life around to see this total crap.
