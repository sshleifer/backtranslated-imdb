Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous spectacle <br /> <br /> 2. a director with now own ideas using <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theater production of the piece mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. an actor for the lead role - who has no sense of the role he plays And you will get: "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" <br /> <br /> I have that Hamlet radio play with Maximilian Schell as a member Hamlet and I were so disappointed. I had hoped that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would at least have a body language to underline what he says - nothing. Then the set ... the minimalist design is not for everyone, but usually I like it when onstage is just enough to make it clear what the setting is and nothing more. Oh, that's on a stage, in a theater. It does not work in a movie based on credible settings. That the idea for the set was taken from the theatrical production in which Schell was already playing Hamlet, let's say that's the only thing that could be complained about and how anyone could allow Hamlet a second time to play. If you have the choice to watch one of the approximately sixty films based on "Hamlet", then do not watch this movie unless you are a masochist or really hardcore or want to make fun of uninvited actors.
