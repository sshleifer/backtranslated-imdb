"The Secretary" is one of those cheesy, clich√©d "thrillers" that you have to watch on a Sunday afternoon, when there's nothing else. While the conspiracy (a denied woman jealous of anyone who succeeds in the office and decides to do anything to stop her) may be unique, I saw countless conspiracies that probably stem from other television films I've had was from the same Reason exposed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not thrilled with the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many TV movies as a "mother" or as a kind of "victim" of a nasty game or abuse that one has to ask oneself what life she leads. In this case, she gets the pleasure of playing a mother AND a victim of psycho-secretary Sheila Kelly, who as a villain was not a particularly good choice. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and I think, Law and Order), she's also plagued by a series of pathetic television movie roles, and that role only adds to that. As far as the others are concerned, I have no clear memories of them, so that must say something. <br /> <br /> This will play on the Lifetime Network (I think I saw it there), but you will not have to look at it unless you are not bored. Not that it makes you more exciting ...
