At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the popcorn as loud as I could to drown out the inferior dialogue. This is absolutely not a girl's movie. All the guys who like it are the ones that we ladies can be sure are far away. Stupid story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap-looking movie. I have seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the bad category. If you actually see it, the thing you are looking forward to is the end. So you can leave the theater as soon as possible.
