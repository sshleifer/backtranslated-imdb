The only reason why I saw 101 Dalmatians were nominations for the original song and costume design of the Oscars. I have to admit that I was less impressed with this film. In this sequel Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close takes that role off very well) is released from hospital for her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals and locks all furs away. From this point on, we'll just wait until she gets crises. Soon she makes and tries to make the best coat of the fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found everything pretty stupid, but funny with children's eyes. That's fair enough, since the target market, I think, is children under 12 years old. Great entertainment for kids and families, but not much for me. * out *****
