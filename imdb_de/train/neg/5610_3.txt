This documentary opens with an interesting premise - it makes a fascinating and convincing argument that the story of Jesus, as generally believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after we have prepared for it, the movie completely shifts and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and it focuses rather on the simple goals. The author / director clearly has some problems with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate rage) and this movie seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to extend the first 20 minutes, but overall the film is disappointing.
