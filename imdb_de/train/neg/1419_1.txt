This is a terrible little movie - and unfortunately the company that made this short film made several others. The short film is essentially a one-wit idea that was not funny at first and might offend you as well. It was certainly unpleasant for me to observe very young children (most of them around two years old), who cavorted and pretended to be adults - in this case, a dancehall girl and a patron. It's the kind of humor that you might need to laugh at from your own children if they pretend to be adults, but I can not see anyone who wants to see this - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is in a pretty scruffy Robe sits outfit and acts like a vamp !! And in other situations, other children behave like adults. I'm sure they did not appeal to pedophiles at the time, but when you look at it today, I immediately remember! That's why this boring movie EVER sneaked me in and I hope I'll never see it again !! Pretty weird and pretty awful.
