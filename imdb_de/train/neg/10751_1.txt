Why did I waste my money on the last Sundance day? I want a refund ... Can I get my $ 16 back? While watching this movie, I always waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. I only knew what it was about when I read the story, which was not really similar to the movie. Why did the director zoom in with his handy camera and then out? It was not very artistic. Why did director Lulu show fifteen minutes polishing his nails? Why did the actors stop talking as if they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt that Phantom Love had no history at all, and to be honest, I felt that my holiday videos had a much higher entertainment value than this movie.
