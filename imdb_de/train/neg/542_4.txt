First there is the Gujarati Theater and then Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fans. Director Vipul Shah should look around differently from the Gujarati Theater when making a Bollywood production. First, he did Aankhen (after a Gujarati play) - which had a unique storyline but could not be considered a Hindi movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarati piece and called it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The plot is not intended for Hindi movies. For example, the role-playing game between father and son is best left to the Gujarati Theater - do not put it in a Hindi movie. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - apart from Shefali Chhaya Shah, who is fantastic.
