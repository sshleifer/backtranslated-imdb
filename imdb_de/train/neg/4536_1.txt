This film is nothing more than a religious treatise embellishing classical Hinduism and New Age occultism with Western imagery. Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both in the present and in the 1600s) obviously reborn. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield has attempted to blend Eastern mysticism with Western Christianty. His attempt at syncretism may deceive or confuse those who are not truth seekers, but this film is a weak excuse for the ultimate reality. As the ad in old Berkeley Barb used to say for $ 10.00, we'll show you how to start your own religion. As a famous prophet said: "Use the power of Luke".
