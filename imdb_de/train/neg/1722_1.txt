This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's extremely boring with many boring dialogues and has some very annoying characters and a ridiculous-looking creature. The only reason I saw this dump was because it was on this 8-disc horror set that I got. The plot is absurd and totally stupid like the finale. No blood, except for a few bloody traces of the creature and a few bloody gunshot wounds. Acting is terrible !! Richard Cardella is terrible like the sheriff and was pretty ridiculous and his character annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was not funny! Bob Hyman is decent but not much else. Richard Garrison is annoying and did not have any chemistry with Kacey Cobb. So Kacey Cobb is here and did not have chemistry with Richard. Total Avoid this garbage piece at all costs! BOMB of 5.
