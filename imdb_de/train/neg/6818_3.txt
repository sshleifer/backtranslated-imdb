In this movie, Joe Pesci makes a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and if you're consistent, the rest of the script is also not credible. <br /> <br /> pesci is a jolly guy who saved this movie from going down in the absolute back of the basement, but the other roles were pretty bad. The father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which was not even well played. Rather than being an archetypal villain, the man seemed to be more of an amoral android, earning money at all costs. Then there's the testimony given to Pesci as a friend or something ... I do not even remember her being so memorable. <br /> <br /> Anyone rating this film over 5 or 6 is a paid member of a movie studio trying to improve the reputation of this submerged movie, or at least one of those millions of minions who can not criticize efficiently (You know, the people who feel bad when they give anything mark below 6). <br /> <br /> Stay away ... far away. and pity about Comedy Central, where I saw this movie. They usually pick better.
