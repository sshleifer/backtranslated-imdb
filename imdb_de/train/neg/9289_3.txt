For those of you who desperately wanted to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, your chance is and you're back in the real world. The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch to transfer him to another jail where wrestling champions loiter and seek brothers. Twitch plans to leave prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. Then something happens and somebody gets shot and the movie turns into another prison in Die Hard. But the wrestler's daughter is involved in everything, so he and Twitch are looking for her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the acting is below average, it has a lot (really annoying)) rap music and poorly edited fight scenes. On the positive side, there's the Hispanic guy playing stars in every jail / action / thriller that's ever been shot, and he closes a door in it. <br /> <br /> It is not very eventful, but at least it is so harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a big fan of the original, it's okay, ish stuff. <br /> <br /> If not, you were warned.
