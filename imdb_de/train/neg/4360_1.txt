Let me first say that I had to think a lot about whether to write a comment for this film. The best review for this kind of cinema can only be the silence. Movie for housewives and grandmothers. This movie tries to look "real" and the characters should be "real people". An Italian could never believe that the characters could be "real": they are just "unobtrusive" stereotypes. There is a very wrong idea of ​​life in the Italian countryside. The action is weak (action? What action?) And the humor does not make anyone laugh who is older than 12.
