The Haunting is yet another evil horror remake with fake Overdone special effects and a huge variety of favorites on screen and has no redeeming qualities except perhaps for cinematography. Yes, remakes are not all bad, but remakes conducted by Jion Da Bont are definite. I suspect that the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, the ridiculous special effects, and the terrible attempts to scare their audience. However, this is not a movie we do not consider a tabloid magazine. I do not care who the characters and story are important in this movie, two things that this movie misses. The story is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House, pulling out four chapters and then making everything left over for the movie so boring and much inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good, you do not really care about any characters. Lily Taylor gives a terrible performance and sounds like she's 8 years old. She's old when she delivers her lines, not to mention what a terrible scream she is. Lily Taylor is not at all made for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghosts and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed like the Grim Reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine. There's a giant purple on the roof of one of the rooms, and it's not even funny that he's unintentionally just sad. The house is pretty and well designed, that's probably the only positive about this movie. He looks good, but he does not save him from his brutal rest. I can honestly say, I feel like I'm wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV without a prize. So I would have been a lot more expensive if I had but luckily it was on Scream Channel. Overall, The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a bad horror attempt.
