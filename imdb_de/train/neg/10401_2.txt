Dear Lieber Dear Dear ... me! I had the strength to see through it ... But why? The first two movies were funny and actually a bit good. But that's so bad that we had problems seeing the whole thing. This was a kind of tremor for children. I can not believe this movie was ever made. Looks like the props are taken from some bad western series (for kids) and they just did everything they could. <br /> <br /> What audience is this movie for? I can only think of 12-14 year olds. If you are older than 14, you have serious problems with this movie. It is not only slow, but also so boring. The characters are overreacted (not just a bit) and so stereotyped, it's fun for a while ... but not long enough to not want to throw tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that's going to happen, because yes ... you've seen it a billion times in every hero series on television for kids. I selected all the survivors and the Tremorf when the characters were introduced. It's so bad .. so wrong..so ... crap. <br /> <br /> But OK, we got a laugh from time to time. It was worth one or two repetitions not only on the stupid pothole holes but in some scenes Repeat it over and over again and laugh with all your heart. I still have to grin when I think about it. But that was just sad once again ... and then the "badass" shooter appears and exaggerates his role wonderfully ... that and a comment "They jump off the ground like a DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point, we almost cried with laughter. But after that, nothing could top the summit anymore (?), So it's pretty downhill from there. <br /> <br /> So there are demon trouts and overreactions. If someone tells you that this is a good movie ... it is either a "plant", vegetable or someone who is very angry. This movie must be by far the worst tremor. I'm looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it will be a blockbuster in comparison to this blockbuster ... those ... * goose bumps * no ... I'll leave it at that.
