Mr. Perlman gives (as usual) an outstanding performance. Unfortunately, he has to deal with a signed script and some nonsensical set pieces. Larsen is in "The Hard" mode with singletons and bulging muscles. I'm sure he could do better but seems content to grimace and growl through his part. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Erika is very decorative (even though she is fully clothed!) and shows some signs that she is "finally" behaving. <br /> <br /> SFX are mainly bad CGI and steal from other movies. <br /> <br /> The shootings are pathetic - earned by the A-Team <br /> <br /> Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID
