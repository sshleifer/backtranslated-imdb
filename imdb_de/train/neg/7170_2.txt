Yikes blew this movie. The characters were weak, the action weaker. I thought that could not be so bad because it has Christoper walking. He must have done that because he was bored and needed the money. The characters should be Irish, but nobody had an Irish accent. I try desperately to find something beautiful. I can not help but that Walken with a wooden character has done a good job. Find something to read or see discovery, never watch this movie.
