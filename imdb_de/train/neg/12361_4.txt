I've seen this recent Woody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and it's important to me to see everything he does, even though the reviews in this movie have disappointed me. You were right. This is a confused film that can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the crisis of women's scenes. It fails with all three. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a troubled middle aged woman who has married in great wealth and lives a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and two young children. This more secular plot concept is enlivened by such implausibilities as an old Chinese folk healer, who makes her invisible with magic herbs, and the spirit of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic to you, how about something more prose, like a saxophonist affair? <br /> <br /> I was never sure what this jumbled mess was about. There are only a handful of really funny moments in the movie, and the end is a really vile touch from Pollyanna. Instead, hire "crime and offense," a superbly successful movie that combines comedy with serious ethics and morality. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
