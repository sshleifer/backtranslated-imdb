I was amazed to see this movie after reading a positive review from another website. It took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the shelf. I did not want anyone to see me. Then 10 minutes to build up the courage to bring it to the counter and actually rent it with real money. I thought that all my stress would pay off when I came home and saw the movie when I saw the movie. what a joke! If you manage to survive the first hour of the movie, you're in luck. b / c only then is the movie a horror. Do not bother with these people, it's better if you "give gratitude"
