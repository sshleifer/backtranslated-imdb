That was disappointing. It started well enough, but when it went on and lost every opportunity to climb, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's acting is terrible, never seems to mean what she says, or even to know what she says until she says it. She showed no real emotion at all, not for her beloved boy or her mother's story. With Lena, she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother, unless her mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The alleged parallel between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√© as it came and failed anyway. The wedding was absolutely unconvincing and a silly conclusion. The climax of the protest was not exciting, and no matter what Lena had done or not to influence the outcome, she would certainly have shown a sense of complexity, a confused look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had depth or spark. It was very hard to take care of any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she remove him from the hotel while phoning? There was no connection or explanation for that.) If any reference to him were removed, he would not notice. <br /> <br /> A simple story made confusing by poor character development (who, in turn, was their mother?), weak acting and directing, where everyone looked like they were acting. You could almost hear, "quiet on set! ....". I thought this was worth a 7, but as the movie progressed, he quickly fell to a 4 and earned a 3rd after the stupidity of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile as I've seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
