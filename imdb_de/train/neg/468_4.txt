Before commenting on this film that I've just seen on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason why I checked was what I first saw in TV ads in 1980: Barbara Bach's cleavage. And since the movie received a rating of R, I expected to see her naked. Unfortunately not a dice for her or the other great actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but was actually 20 when she did that. Seeing her in bra and panties and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as exciting as Ms. Bach's. They offer some of the scattered laughs of this movie. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for removing his name from the credits because his role as a close-knit liceman is rather embarrassing, even though I liked the "seduction" scene he made with Mrs. Nelkin. This is also the debut of Ralph Macchio, the loner among the outsiders, who were sent to an academy school. The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Mrs. Bach, an Arab who prays motor oil, and a son of a politician who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much that he could creep in the middle of the night in the girls' academy. In the minor cast Tom Poston plays a weird figure called Sisson, which I find sometimes amusing. With a screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and a direction by Robert Downey Senior (whose son Robert Downey Jr. appears at an early stage in a football scene), Up the Academy is inconsistent with the politically incorrect humor offended by the skatological and sexual content this is actually a fairly harmless comedy that should not embarrass Mad Magazine and his trademark cover boy Alfred E. Newman, even though they once took their name and character out of the picture. .PS Another "outsider" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my native city of Chicago, Illinois. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
