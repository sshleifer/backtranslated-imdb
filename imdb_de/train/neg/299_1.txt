This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996). <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and was a better movie, the DARAAR was directed by Abbas Mustan, who unfortunately failed in this attempt. <br /> <br /> The story was good, but the handling was not so good and the heroine was too regressive and the climax was also disappointing Direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi repeats his Role of YAARANA (weird, which was also a remake of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead role and is fine. Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and manages to calm the audience in many scenes, but his voice was terrible. Johny is too loud
