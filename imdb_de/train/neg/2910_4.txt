The highlight of this movie for me was without a doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle a role that is unusual for him. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and rooted. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that he was noble in the context of this film - he wanted to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Nevertheless, he was already a gangster and murderer before these murders. So Hanks assumed a role in which I did not expect him, and did it well. <br /> <br /> Apart from Hanks' good performance, I certainly could not call this an entertaining movie. After an opening that I could best describe as enigmatic (for a while I was not sure where this was going on), it becomes a very bleak film about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - mostly by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mob boss and tries to raise his own two sons and keep them "clean", so to speak; isolated from his business. After the elder son sees a murder, the gang tries to kill him to silence him, gets the wrong son (and mother) and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It's becoming a weird kind of father / son bonding movie. <br /> <br /> Although it ends with a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story), it is really very dark and the mood is intensified. Many scenes are recorded in darkness and pouring rain. I have to admit that while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie as a whole just did not pull me in. 4.10
