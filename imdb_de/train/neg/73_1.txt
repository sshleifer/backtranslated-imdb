This is the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartbreaker? He looked disfigured. I wish I had known that he and Naomi Watts were an object in real life because I had spent two of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a heartbreaker? With the wobbly beard and the deer in the spotlight he looks like this. I can not agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked like he could not wait until you left the set. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to regret bank robbers and killers. This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, who was actually an entertaining movie. That was banal, clich√©d and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced that it would get better. It was not the case. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally funny. Heath and his gang are housed in a border hotel and women and children die because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they left the hotel with armored armor, because we could only think of the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I waited for them to say, "I'm biting off your leg!" We howled with laughter, as did some other twisted onlookers. When we left, almost everyone was talking about what a waste of time this movie was. <br /> <br /> I may not have paid any money to see this disaster (preview), but it certainly was not free. It took me 2 hours of my life that I will never come back.
