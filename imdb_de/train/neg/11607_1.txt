I found horror vision almost unsurpassable. While I was only 70 minutes long, I hit the fast-forward button again and again. Acting was from school when I scream and say I'm intense. And the story was, at best, a scenario that still did not need to be resolved. <br /> <br /> Although I never go for great shots on Full Moon, I have never seen them make such a heavy piece of garbage.
