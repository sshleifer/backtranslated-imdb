Effort aside (This is not a good intent report, it's about the end product), this film is poorly written, overpriced and badly directed. The story obviously had potential, but this story is nowhere to be seen in this film. Clara Barton was a human. She had passions, longings, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-doubt just as we all did. You would never know that from the lead actress. In fact, this is true for every character in the movie, but in Barton's case: every sentence is a speech. An epic speech from above as from an inhuman robot. In fact, this is the only scene that sounds good in the board meeting, and I realized she was giving a speech! Any idea she has is incredible in her context, and she comes up with ideas that sound like they're looking for souls for life. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she begins to think about the needs of the battlefield, to protect soldiers, and to set white flags. In seconds, a thoughtful idea. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie deprives Clara Barton of her struggles. It deprives her of her humanity and cheapened everything she did because the script is written in clich√©s. The author does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based his screenplay on an Encyclopedia Britannica article. (Yes, they had them then) But hey, nice technicolor! (who cares)
