The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (ie, H. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the movie). Apart from that, the rest of the cast is average and only serves to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but also stupid ones. It's not a deep movie again, but it's good for a few laughs. But it was funnier than sketch. However, if you are looking for a pretty funny movie, I would recommend this movie. Do not think too much about it or you will not hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
