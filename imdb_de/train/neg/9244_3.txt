You can handle historical inaccuracies, but this movie was just too much. Virtually nothing was as close to truth as possible, and even for the era it was considered stupid. In defense of Ford, revealed on an old talk show that he was operating on the story told him the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old and senile, and repeated the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach and how it should happen during the arrival of the stagecoach. Therefore, Wyat himself claims that this was deliberately intentional. This film describes Earp as an honest man and also his brothers. History does not say exactly if they were or not. Most people like to put a little fraud and lawlessness into their characters, but that's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them than the law-abiding nature of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the Old West you had no time to think about too much else. Characters That Do not Exist, Characters That Are Dying Corral, who really did not do that, all make this movie weaker. It is further weakened by Mature, who has really made no convincing Doc. He may be the worst cast ever for Doc, but at the same time we need to remember that older films were closer to the epoch and closer to a sense of truth. Eventually, Ford got first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It is also weakened by the predictable events in which the Mexican girl is involved. At that time, Hollywood was very pro-Nazi and ready to kill brunette women in a very predictable way to demonstrate Hitler's idealism. This occurs in most films until the eighties. It is no excuse and cheapened the art. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earps are good, and Brennan is always exciting. In fact, Mature is the only real disadvantage of this strip. It is still the weakest of the old OK Corral films.
