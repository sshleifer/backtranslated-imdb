Robert Altman's downcast Western-torn western from Edmund Naughton's McCabe was overlooked at the time of its release, but has found a critical following in recent years. Apart from an absolutely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters do not deserve much interest here and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unsightly. The bearded Warren Beatty is a turn-of-the century entrepreneur who settles on the edge of nowhere in a weakening community and helps to organize the first brothel. As soon as the profit starts, of course, Beatty is threatened by city fighters who want part of the action. Altman creates a festive, wintry atmosphere for the film that gives the audience a sense of time and place, but the plot in this sad little town is limited - most of the story is vignette - and Altman's pace is purposely sluggish. There is hardly any statement (on the contrary), and the sluggish actors stare at each other without much thought. It's a self-destructive image, yet it's proudly vanquished altmanically. ** from ****
