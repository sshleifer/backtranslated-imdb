Elephants Dream should be the flagship project of the open source community. And although it was a very interesting idea in the concept, in reality it has failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A huge problem with them, however, is the far exceeding of the light bloom. It's awful, though I think it helps to give the movie a dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to keep in mind is the terrible voice that works. While the spokesman for Proog is at least halfway competent, Emo's spokesman is "HORRIBLE". I think if you have a budget that is basically zero, you can not afford to engage real speakers. It seems to me that they hired an animator to play his voice. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie does not really go on. For me it seems to be more of a film that can "see what we can do" than a real movie. The action goes nowhere and shows no interesting point. The entire movie looks like an excuse to make interesting-looking areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, it may be worth it to get a quick download from the official website, but do not expect anything but pretty graphics.
