Impressive! Only a movie that is so ridiculously horrible could inspire the similar "showgirls". I mean where to start The inevitably terrible title song? Pia Zadora is not an expression throughout the movie? The fact that every single man (and every woman!) In Los Angeles, also known as the Land of the Casting Couch, gets totally confused with Pia Zadora to sleep by any means? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally disliked because he is either stupidly stupid (Pia) or obviously despicable Sleazeball (everyone else)? And since this movie was written by real "screenwriters" (sorta), it shows a shocking misunderstanding in the movie industry (who would admire hell and kiss to a SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br /> But it's (unintentionally ) funny weird. The "Breakdown" scene alone will make you giggle, and after seeing the climate, I'm not the only one on the way to the "top" scene. "Awards" (all in the usual bargain basement) Level, as we expect from such good theaters as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually reused this speech when she "won" her Golden Globe make my day. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, try this exhausting movie.
