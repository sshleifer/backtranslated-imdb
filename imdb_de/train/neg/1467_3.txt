No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the groundbreaking Hitler biography, who was originally the scientific adviser to this television film, distanced himself from it. The film is historically too wrong. The mistakes begin immediately when Hitler's father Alois dies at home while actually dying in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in 1913 he actually moved to Munich. I could go on and on. Hitler's childhood and adolescence are portrayed too briefly, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important personalities of the early days of the party, such as Hitler's fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, are completely absent. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble figure who almost despises Hitler. The script apparently follows Hanfstaengl's own overview of himself after the war in his biography. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about his "leader". The biggest problem of the film, however, is the presentation of Hitler. He is characterized as someone who is always rude, has neither charisma nor charm and constantly commands all nearby. After watching the movie, one wonders how such a disgusting human could ever find followers. Of course, as we all know what a wicked criminal Hitler was, every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as wholly disgusting and uncharismatic. However, the fact is that privately he can be very charming and entertaining. His comrades did not follow him, because he had shouted at them all the time, but because they liked this strange man. Apart from all these historical mistakes, the film is well done, the actors are first class, the filming locations and the production design convey a credible impression of the era.
