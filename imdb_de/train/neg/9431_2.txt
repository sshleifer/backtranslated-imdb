Basic Slasher movie idea, 3 young women ruin their car and stay with a spooky family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ's car chase with a white sedan instead of a Broncos. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold dementia who controls her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes when the actors watch while eating - YAWN Trying to figure out what to do Hell they eat ... OK, maybe there's a drinking game here ... No - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK, I caught my interest for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and uninspired murders ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The end ... Dude! this psycho is messed up - why could not the rest of the movie be like in the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that's - my advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and look at that and then put something good into the player - I go to sleep again.
