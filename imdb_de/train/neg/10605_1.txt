That was a cruel waste of time. No plot The acting was so far below average that it should serve as an example in acting classes, which is NOT to do. It's just a commercial rip-off of the former universal soldier who also scrapes the bottom of the barrel in action. It is sad that VD has to enforce its ego every few years and it is even sadder that people have to pay good money for it. This type of punch gives martial arts films a bad name. In comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold are almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should take the Leslie Nielson track and make send-ups of its genre. At least then we could laugh with him instead of him.
