This movie is just bad. Weak story, weak direction and below average action. The thing that really irritated me was the constant advertisement for a well-known Internet provider. It is obvious that some scenes were written for it, namely advertising. This movie is a slap in the face for anyone who has paid for it. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, it's not worth it.
