Another horror movie in which a nasty teenager fights a madman and his supernatural buddy who wants to take power ?! Yes, but the fact that he came from Canada gives a different feeling. "The Brain" has put the annoying teenager Jim Majelewski into a treatment whose leader proves to be a cult leader, who is supported by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I think that since our northern neighbor has achieved everything he has achieved, they are allowed to shoot at least one ridiculous horror movie. Nevertheless, they will probably want to be known for national health care and all. <br /> <br /> The villain had a brain. Why not the people who made this movie?
