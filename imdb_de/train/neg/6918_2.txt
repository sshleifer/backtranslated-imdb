I chose this movie and believed it had good reviews. First, it is ridiculous that they are releasing a film that was originally filmed in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks outdated. Even for 2001, the movie looks like it was made with a shoe-string budget. There is a scene where a taxi meets a man to determine how low the budget can be. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. In the end he gives a long monologue. If the movie had bright sparks during this scene, I missed him when I slept in my place. Nothing to Jennifer Love Hewitt is like a devil. She wears bad-fitting, banal clothes and scowls on random children. With Alec Baldwin, a scene in which he meets Webster for the first time can not be overlooked. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Go home and write better!"
