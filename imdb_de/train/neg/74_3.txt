They constructed this as a kind of fantasy. Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. Only for a romantic touch Ned and Joe can play with high-class talents, the bored young women rich older men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still leave room for artistic creativity to achieve a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, not the legends of Arthur, not Beowulf, not of someone whose life has gone so far into the mists of centuries, that every renewal of their lives and time is 99% guess-work , It is only a few lives ago. My own grandparents were already in school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> It's stupid of me to imagine that this film was a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. Having recently read Peter Carey's brilliant novel The True History of the Kelly Gang, I had anxiously expected that to happen in a similar way. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's 1970 Kelly Kelly was mocked much earlier and was a better movie overall that does not say much. <br /> <br /> I'm glad he just cost me two dollars to rent the DVD! I give 3/10, and that's only because some of the beautiful shots of the Australian bush make me generous.
