A friend gave it to me and said it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint concerns the most unattractive leading actress in the porn industry. Even worse, she's almost always on the screen. But I read somewhere that porn then had to have an "artistic" value. I could not find it. See it only if you are interested in the development of porn in the mainstream or appreciate art in porn movies. I know that I am not. The director of the film, however, seems to be a talented person. He even tried to persuade Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course they refused.
