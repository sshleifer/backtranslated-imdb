Fox's "The True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is a remarkably poor remake of the prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the flaw lies, but the casting in this release the two central characters, the uneven alignment of Nicholas Ray and the script with the shit fuck, must certainly have something to do with it. <br /> <br /> In the late '30s and' 40s, Tyrone Power was Fox's leading man, but in the fifties his star began to fade, and studio boss Darryl Zanuck began cleaning newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place. This was a big mistake by Zanuck, as Wagner proved less suitable. With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956), it is hard to imagine that Wagner differs in anything! In addition, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before playing Frank James and Wagner's Jesse in The True Story Of Jesse James. Borrowed from the studio last year, this actor honors his outstanding and insightful performance in John Ford's classic The Searchers. But playing here, along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, is nothing short of boring. None of the players brings personality or color into their respective roles. They completely miss the sign, they lack the charisma and charm that Power and Fonda show so vividly in the original. The film is also disturbed by too many flashbacks and with the ubiquitous script Wagner, like the Robin Hood of the American West, appears as a charming introverted jerk who does not convey any empathy. The cast is hardly worth mentioning, but it's a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead, barely seen as Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best aspect of this unpretentious Western is the wonderful cinemascope / color cinematography of the great Joe McDonald and the outstanding score of the underrated and little-known composer Leigh Harline!
