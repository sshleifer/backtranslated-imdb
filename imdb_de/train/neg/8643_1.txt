A Blair Witch War movie as disappointing as Bwitch! The title says it all, saves your time and money, and does it for a good movie like Once Upon a Time in America, The Shawshank Redemption or Enemy at the Gates (if you want to see a BIG movie) ") etc. <br /> <br /> If it was a baseball team and the major leagues were the titles and single A were the beginners, then this movie was High School Ball. It was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with her father's old camera. Sure, they went to a hostile area (to make a movie), but I do not call that brave, we just call it stupid! This is a whole pass! Now look at it and then you tell me what you think.
