I had the annoyance to see this movie with my girlfriend, who like me is a fan of the first one. This movie is really shit! It lacked the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crappy, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and sound terrible and stupid. Basically it's like the Lion King 1 1/2, apart from the different stories that are all told by the mice. The reason why I forgive this with 2 out of 10 is because the songs that were not sung by the characters were the most beautiful.
