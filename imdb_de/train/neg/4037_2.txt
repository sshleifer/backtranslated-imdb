I have no idea what the producers of The Shield have tried, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is virtually unsurpassed. <br /> <br /> The performances on The Shield are said to be great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so poorly arranged that you can not even really see it. For example, the processing cuts off the reaction images before they have shown their full effect. <br /> <br /> I do not know what intellectual reasons for that, but it robs the show of all emotional influences. <br /> <br /> I give The Shield a point for ambition in the subject, but that's pretty much all I can give. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see some talents performers are wasting their gift for something so strangely bad-filmed.
