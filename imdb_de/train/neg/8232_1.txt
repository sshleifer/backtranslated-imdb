Five eyes on the eyes are not worth anything from the wrist. I have to admit that I was really worried. For 30 seconds, no one made a sound, and I thought my speakers had blown, or I would have been deafened by the constant screaming and feeling high pitch screams, me and the speakers are fine, thanks for the question, strangely enough this is the best piece of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time telling you the story, read the other comments for that. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD, but you have not yet unpacked it Take them back and claim your money back. I wasted my, do not do the same. <br /> <br /> I actually shouted for the TV "You're in the car, looking for the camera lights and getting the cameraman first", I've skipped the swear words, but you can guess where they're going. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to buy this movie (it's really good), it's yours for ten pounds.
