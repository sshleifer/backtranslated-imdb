Dirt over three beautiful women in California visiting a festival (or so). All hotels are booked so they have to stay in a spooky old house. What they do not know is that there is an eerie resident who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawning. Boring, pointless, completely stupid "horror" movie. Bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is boring DULL! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are completely empty. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or blood to keep you on the way. Women are expected to expect female nudity, but that is not enough to save this. Boring, meaningless and unknown (for a good reason). A 1 all the way.
