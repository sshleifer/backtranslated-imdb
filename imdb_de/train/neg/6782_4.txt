None of Keaton's best efforts. This was perhaps a veiled attempt to avenge the family he had married into - the Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster into a marriage with a large Irein who treats him (along with her father and her brothers) until they believe he may be a legacy of fortune. There are countless false identities - gags are set up and not paid for the majority. <br /> <br /> This subway short has at least two real laughs - Buster cleverly turns his calendar around on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adoptive family to literally bring the meat to the plate. The other is a family photo where the entire group falls slowly to the ground as the tripod loses stability. <br /> <br /> The yeast overflow could have been the trigger for a huge number of gags on gags, but short (for all clusters) of development. <br /> <br /> The pressure of cinema is sharp and clear and the score is one for players, piano, drums and sound effects. None of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
