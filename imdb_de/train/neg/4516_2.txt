I bought this DVD set without seeing it and wished I had not. The script had to be seriously reworked because it seems to be completely numb and pale compared to the book. The lighting is awful, very unpolished, but if it were only, I might miss it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... There is hardly an introduction to different characters, which makes it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in the planes - no idea who will die when). <br /> <I've long had the feeling that the key to making a good movie is getting the audience to take care of the characters. If you do not have that, you have nothing. There was no focus at all on the characters - you never met them - who they were, what they liked ... what made them do the things they do. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts. I bet you're wondering what they've been doing all along, if they have not described the characters in detail. I'll say at least an hour is spent watching them land LOL in their planes and take off (I mean, do we really have to keep seeing that ???). I would have rated this much better if they had just improved our knowledge of the characters.
