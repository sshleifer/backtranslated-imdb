The guys from MST3K should see this dog of a movie. Basically it's about a stupid hack actor in Hollywood who can not land drama gigs. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So, what does this stupid actor do? He dyes his hair blonde and begins to behave like a L.A. surfer buddy, in the naive hope that this will make him roll. You will laugh at so many inadvertently funny scenes of this movie. For example, if the actor's girlfriend is a broken heart and sobbing and lines like "How can you do this to me?" And why is she crying? Because he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer type for acting concerts. This movie makes no sense with ALL! The actor who played the governor of Benson is also there and he plays a stereotype right-wing politician with a stupid, witty dialogue. This movie will rip you, trust me. Are you talking to me ?!
