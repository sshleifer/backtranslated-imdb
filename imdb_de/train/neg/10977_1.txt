I live in Ottawa, where this movie was made, and I really wish it had not been that way. This is a terrible god blow. I'm really trying to support Independent Movies, but it's this stigma tied to everything indie and this stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie is nothing against this curse. The actor, writer and director Brett Kelly does not contribute much to contribute to the genre, but attacks tired stereotypes from the past. I'm really tired of threatening evil-looking characters lurking in the shadows and plundering the unsuspecting, it's way too over the top. <br /> <br /> I can remember a scene before the end of the strip, where the entire scene is lit up with car headlights. Some may now say that this was an effect that creates mood and excitement, but unfortunately the budget of this film should be presented. Just as for a movie that dares to call itself a horror, a viewer will find it hard to find any real pile, apart from a few scenes of corn syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that pulls this movie down is the pace and lack of character development. The basic conspiracy is that children are kidnapped and the parents have to locate this Bonesetter scholarship a certain time ago to get their children back. Not that this concept bothers me, but I did not find it really credible that both those who have lost children have time to deal with each other. This happens in such a short time that it is inconceivable. My top priority would be to bring my daughter back and at least meet the lady before going out with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is ... and I will not disagree with Kelly, but the movie is completely shot on boring, emotionless videos, and that really takes away all tense moments just having style leaked in the movie. However, if this movie beautifies a million dollars and renews the story and the boring drama and lame play, everything could not keep this movie afloat. My only hope is that something will happen that prevents Brett Kelly from making a sequel that has been posted on his website. A sequel half written in one session. <br /> <br /> Lord, help us all.
