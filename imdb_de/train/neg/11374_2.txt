I could not relate to this movie. It did not concern me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and indissoluble. I could not connect with the characters, so I do not care about the characters. I find it hard to find a lot of positives that are positive. <br /> <br /> I have read it to be properly familiar with some of the darker aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that as an atheist, I'm probably unfamiliar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I've also seen many films that deal with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still general to the human condition and concerns are not relying on expertise or beliefs.
