THE CHOKE (also known as AX in the UK) is a slasher that is thought to be produced as a direct DVD movie. I say "allegedly" because the title of the movie does not contain the "V" in parentheses to indicate that it is a DVD movie (though it looks like a movie). <br /> <br /> The story is simple? A band organizes a gig in a former meat packing factory and they are killed one after another. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the movie would never be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the mistakes here. Even DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have many redeeming qualities and sometimes work as one of the so-called "so bad, they're good" movies. THE CHOKE, however, is far from being either a serious slasher (like HALLOWEEN) or a "so bad that it's good" (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie starts off well with a character killed with a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy, but understandable given the very low budget. But from there it goes all the way down. <br /> <br /> THE CHOKE has so many mistakes that I could talk to it all day long. But a few obvious ones stand out and I agree. <br /> <br /> The band's gig mentioned above seems to start with about 50 attendees, but after the music stops, it seems to be just 8 people left (and yet all of them are supposed to be imprisoned !). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not sympathetic at all. Most band members are aggressive stupidities or just funny. Nobody really cares what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget them when they get dropped off. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meat packing factory as a kind of church (serious!). He spits out some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately his presence can not save the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes where people walk around and talk without character. In about 65 minutes, the film is spent with watchful characters. Characters disappear for a long time without explanation. Like other DVD movies like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time aggressively and provocatively interacting with each other. There are many exaggerated outbreaks (mainly of male characters), and one could almost lead to a full-blown fight. It can be said that the format is as follows: characters walk around - murder takes place - characters walk around - murder takes place. You have the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is awful and it seems that only a few lines are spoken without the F-word being used. Maybe that should be funny, but it's just sad. And more, we have all seen a thousand times (usually too much more). <br /> <br /> The film is completely tension-free. The bodies serve only as an indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac runs off and yet the characters behave like total idiots. They make hardly any attempt to leave the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same way as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder, when the identity of the killer is revealed) , A random weapon appears from nowhere to kill the victim in question. At no time has anyone been seen persecuting the characters. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE this made the movie funny (of course unintentionally), but here it is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> And as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack also includes music is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable. The score (in the end, there is no music!) Consists of a group of Sugarbabe wannabees singing a very bad song unrelated to the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as well as classics (like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). However, THE CHOKE seems to have been trying hard to fit into one of these categories without fitting into one of these categories. And even with films that relate directly to DVD, this is a small effort. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie contains some pretty good bloody murder scenes. However, if the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes quickly lose importance as the intensity they provide is forgotten. <br /> <br /> Fans of the traditional B-movie slashers of the 1980s should take action to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!
