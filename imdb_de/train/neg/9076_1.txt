This was certainly the stupidest, cruelest and most repulsive movie I have seen for some time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but when I watched the fascination of a terrible car accident, I literally found HASSABLE in every conceivable way and beat it to the end. I am by no means a dupe who objected to the comic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There's something about Mary, both American pie films and the infamous Freddy Got Fingered, whom I've enjoyed very much in their rough conditions. The sponge bath of Mamie Van Doren is the most horrific appearance of a naked geriatrics since The Shining. Inappropriately edited and filmed, with unbelievably annoying performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended without me even chuckling. The only useful purpose for the film is a textbook example of how to make a rough picture. Oh, and it would also be good as a lawn fertilizer.
