She was catapulted from 13 to 30, with magical dust, 13-year-old Matt, but none of this is done except as an inexplicable device. New York City, especially Central Park, but also every other piece of the place that has been incorporated into the movie, seems hopeful and easy to inhabit, and apart from Lucy, there is no villain in Jenna's adult life, and even Lucy is not viewed monstrously. Only as a nasty 13-year-old has grown 17 years. Chris, the former subject of Jenna's longing, is now a Porky taxi driver, and you've seen enough movies to know that Matt will play an important role in Jenna's future. You do not know exactly what might prevent this from happening before it's finally reached, even though I'm here to whisper in your ear, so to speak, that the device is not unique. In fact, it's not just a variation on the subject of Tom Hank's "Big," though not nearly so good, but also a strictly literal version of this subset of Cinderella's story.
