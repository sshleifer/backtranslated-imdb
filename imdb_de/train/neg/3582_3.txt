No, it's not the horror movie ... This is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a 1927 silent movie starring two boxers and the woman standing between them. She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion comes. Although she marries One Round, she obviously flirts with the champion until the final boxing match between One Round and the champion. She returns to the corner of One Round, when things look the darkest, and miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win back the love of his wife. <br /> <br /> but the time restrictions must not have made him make a permanent movie. Although there are special movie tricks and some comedy reliefs, this movie does not detract from his later work. However, it must have been extremely daring for the time with the shameless adulteress. That may have been the setback in 1927. Looking through all these old films, it's amazing how I think they could be replicated on today's screen and really come to a standstill. Maybe I should be the one ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie if you do not want to see all of Hitchcock's films. You could fall asleep in the middle.
