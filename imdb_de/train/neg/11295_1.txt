I understand that this movie is for kids, and as a parent, I've been through a lot of films that do not particularly interest me, but I can see from a constructive perspective how it is accepted by my children. Finally, parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment they are watching, so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience at a certain level, even in children's films. Disney has always understood this, which is why it's so hard to figure out how such a piece of Drek could bear his name. Technically, the sound editing is terrible and all dialogues sound overly. synchronized and unnatural. Personally, I hate that, but it was doubly horrible to think that the dialogue was apparently written by a 12-year-old student for a school project. The "acting" reminded me of a school play, and none of the children actor had a lot of emotions in his voices. Luckily it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Well, before I look like a video geek measuring a kids movie with an adult cane, that's one thing that can save even the worst kids movie positive news. I do not care to determine how a message must be delivered as long as it is the right one. Let's go through this movie to see what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you're lost, do not worry, you'll inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> approaching wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you can "know" that you. <br /> <br /> and my favorite the last message left in the film: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey authority people and do what you think is right.
