I got a DVD from "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "accept": it turns "u-" and "me" into a "donkey". I had read before watching that BII contains a lot of original material and actress Love played. As I watched "Return of the Boogeyman," I decided to move through the original footage and see the notorious Death-by-Toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Rip off. I think I thought this was BII because it has a title similar to one of BII's alternate titles. Well, at least that was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start with the film's mistakes. Many, many mistakes. Who makes this guy Ulli? Does he really believe that the same movie is being sold in different forms? There is nothing original that holds Part III. It's basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic who gives us a gruesomely boring game for play while everything happens. That's the movie. Oh, and a death-by-stereo scene, but you can read that from another's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is not a series of films that can be seen from the back to the back.
