Although I never want to be the kind of person who rejects the personal taste of another; If you like something, that's fine. But this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I do not really like Ani Difranco, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter, I can admit. But I can not admit that there are any redeeming qualities in this film. Many people are of the opinion that this is an accurate account of the problems faced by students. Maybe, but everything is too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt at a "Naked Gun" -like comedy, but the timing is over. There is too much space between the two actors, as if they were laughing (there were none). Who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to squeeze so many controversial topics into one movie that they almost never completely developed one of them (especially the girl who was impregnated by a teacher). I did not even laugh during the entire movie. I was too offended by this attempt to make humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes to the screen.
