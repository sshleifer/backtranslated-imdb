I admit to be grown up at the age of hippie dippies, I'm a jerk for this kind of movies. I can enjoy a little more of the hippie genre's punch far more than most "normal" people. However, this movie is terrible in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> Every banal perception of hippie stupidity is portrayed as a gospel, and police officers kill a young, long-haired man when he lands a plane peacefully. This movie is so horrible that it's not even funny to consider the hippie drone's excesses as a jerk. It's like a left version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars was that there were some interesting points on the soundtrack. In addition, I could not find a choice for negative stars. <br /> <br /> No actor, almost no plot, no scissors, Hardly a script ... You got it, a "art" movie .... All this in root canal drilling, with each meaningless scene pulled out will, just to complete the time. <br /> <br /> In a bizarre lifestyle that imitates art, the film's star Nonactor joined a real church and robbed a bank in Boston. One of his co-robbers was killed and he was put in jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident" ..... and just think he left that as a legacy ... Oy vey.
