This movie is so horrible that angels lose their wings. Shaq had attempted other crossover efforts, such as his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums, and later the epic performance of terrible film art, which is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie. I've seen it a few times when I was very young, but I must have been an idiot then, because this movie takes everything that's fun in movies, and rips it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel some time ago and spent a few minutes on it. Once the thrill of ridicule is accomplished, you will still be overwhelmed by its awfulness. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, try the following: Watch the movie as a whole, removing all of it from scenes in which Shaq uses his magical powers of mind. When you do that, it becomes like a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and knocking to seduce him. That's kind of weird and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A horrible example of a movie. Do not watch this movie unless you mock it.
