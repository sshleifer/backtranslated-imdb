I'm just going to be unclear as far as my possible discarding comments are concerned. In this movie, there are enough prefabricated plinth elements that are essentially spoiled. <br /> <br /> This film derives some ideas from a southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source ... anyway, after you've seen this, you're going to say, "Oh yeah, that's a rip-off". <br /> <br /> I think that's true The entertaining thing about these McMovies is, once you've identified a plotel item, you need to figure out whether to stick to the original or try to shoot it. Not many twists in this.
