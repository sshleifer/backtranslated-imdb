It is a pity that you can not choose zero stars at IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact, I would say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I bought this movie and thought it could be good because it contains Michael Madsen ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a movie length: "The Bold and the Beautiful," well, Primal Instinct did not even come close to this good, and I had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than the movie length "The Bold and the Beautiful" , <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this to us? The worst part is, I did not rewind a bit, I was hoping that in the end they would reveal that this was all a kind of sick joke, that they thought it would be fun to see such a terribly bad movie. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Director - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Edit - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half a Star, Graphic Design - Half Star, DVD Menu - Half a Star. <br /> <br /> But I think it's very important to have seen bad movies so you know what a really bad movie that is why I'm glad I saw this movie just for that I can put a bad movie on my list.
