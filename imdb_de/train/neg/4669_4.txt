It is interesting that a storyless novel has become the basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good, if not quite accurate adaptation, Washington Square is a hardened and poorly handled movie, with the exception of the part of Dr. Sloper, who could have been so much better The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I actually writhed. It has none of the unobtrusive and simple beauty that a movie without action like Onegin can have. I agree with other comments on Leigh's portrayal of Catherine as an idiot instead of being naive and shy. She made me despise that she did not feel for her. Catherine's transition from childlike trust to adult cynicism, the whole meaning of the story, was internalized, just like in the novel. But we do not have the advantage of a narrative voice to tell us in a movie! I think someone skipped the adaptation class at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to turn a difficult text into a moving and beautiful film that did not work.
