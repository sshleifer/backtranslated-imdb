The underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train accident I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again. He realized that he was so terrible, but he had to prove to me how terrible he was. I love color comedy. At least I thought that it would and I would be entertained. No, instead the drama was so terrible, the "jokes" were extremely cheesy and the plot could not be found. Maybe there should be no conspiracy, so I can not hold that against this movie. It's pretty sad, where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman who hit her head with a thug ... Batman ... A baseball-uniformed man wearing a bat. Hilarious Simply awesome. I felt as I saw this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe it was full of inner jokes that we simply did not understand. Or it may be the worst piece of garbage ever made, and it should be locked up in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
