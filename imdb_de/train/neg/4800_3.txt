If you made a genre movie in the late '80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance, either under water or in a jail (unfortunately we never got an underwater prison strip). Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) is framed for killing Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa) and ends up on death row, right next to the brother of mob boss Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). However, this is the least of Derek's problems as the dreaded government agent (and Mob Stoolie), Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) uses the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only film that Saxon has directed during his eventful career. For a man who has worked with tons of directors, it seems he finds only the cheapest o-Italian tips. Sure, it's a low budget, but that can not excuse the staged staging, the shooting of gaffs or the clumsy presentation in the first 15 minutes. Saxon bleed it a bit and works in a hilarious nude scene (our lead falls asleep during a jail riot to dream of a scientist only). Cole, who looks like a more robust Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as a stoic leader and Franciosa - with a really bad carpet - is all about clich√© mob bosses. The end will take place at the favorite spot of Marty McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE on DVD.
