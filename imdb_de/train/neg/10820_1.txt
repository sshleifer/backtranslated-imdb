What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I console myself that someone who does not speak English as a native language has completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte's classic? I do not think I can improve a comment I read below. I'll just put it this way: "Jane Eyre is a great book, the scriptwriter should read it at some point." It is true that the two tracks of this film were sadly wrong. But shame about the actors, because the writer has omitted the best scenes. The dialogue that lets you understand that Jane and Rochester have a get-together and a shared sense of fun ... deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune-teller ... gone. The allusions, half joke, half sincere, to come to Jane as a fairy sprite from ancient England to save Rochester in his despair ... defeated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. However, it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love of one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find the 1983 (?) mini-series starring Timothy Dalton.
