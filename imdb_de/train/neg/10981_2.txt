Or listen. Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this is not the worst gay movie I've ever seen (that would be in terms of Billy), but it's at the bottom of the barrel.> This thing pulls and pulls and pulls. It's not that the plot is crazy - it could have worked in the hands of a good writer. , , it certainly could have been much more entertaining. There is not a single plot point you can not see for ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To offend the injury, it's full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship between the two leads was possible, let alone real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact, no evidence of why the leaders love each other. , , we have just been told that they are in love. Difficult to understand when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. You like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> Acting is not totally bad, but the tempo is painfully slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch-slow, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch films, avoid them.
