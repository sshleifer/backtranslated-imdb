I remember that this was the reason it was shown in the week after Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS series aired. The trailers emphasized that the main character had a mutilated arm, and I was hoping he would be like Victor Caroon of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT roaming the streets of London. Just a rather shabby thriller with the Kniffel, a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of corrupt horse racing investigations. I think if you're a fan of Dick Francis, you might enjoy it, but putting it in the late 70's, when THE SWEENEY was just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced, is missing something in THE RACING GAME. One trailer showed a car driving another on a road, if it had been a trailer for THE SWEENEY, you'd see Jack Regan grab a car and make a confession out of the cinders that made a blitz during THE PROFESSIONALS would have taken a car and blown up the terrorists. I think that sums up what's wrong with this series
