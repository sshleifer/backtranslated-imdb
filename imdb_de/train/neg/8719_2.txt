Well, I'm going with another B-industry movie. It's sad enough to see some badly made films, but I do not care if a B-industry or C-industry produces the film. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. Acting is out of the question here (surprise), but the plot is. How can a close-knit squad witness how two of his comrades are slaughtered and then move on as if nothing had happened. What made me sick was how the writer even gave the other members a scene in which they joked about how nice the doctor's ass was. Give me a break.
