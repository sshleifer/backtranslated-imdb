This is the worst crap I have seen lately. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is just stupid, dialogues do not make sense, humorous scenes have never heard anything about the actual humor. Actors just do not play, the worse they do not even try. The script itself is something that is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this streak, the fighting. They are well choreographed, as you would expect from the guys from Hong Kong, and they are the only reason to look at Prince of the Sun. Although I believe that the battles should only fill the empty space, so the scriptwriter does not have to worry about the story. However, this feeble and absurd act can prevent you from seeing them to the end. Avoid it, unless you are a fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
