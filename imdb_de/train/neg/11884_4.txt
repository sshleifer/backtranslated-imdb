The biggest joke in the world. The biggest and most exclusive insider joke in the world. <br /> <br /> This film, which mimics the humor and "everyone's humor" of office space, drives the appeal of this film to the ground, by making the humor so that it would only be from the secretaries, the Writing books, properly appreciated. The audience is asked to take on the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then to empathize with the excruciatingly stupid protagonist. The entire film focuses on the Legal Secretary finding free time, listening to music and writing novel while working. These are his goals. You can not imagine that the slap in the face for the audience when they find (about halfway) that he had a job that meets all three of these criteria, but then gives him up! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even entertain with a protagonist who has previously thrown away what he laments about his lack. Aside from this, the inside secret of the legal secretary is a major stumbling block because it has to be explicitly explained to the audience each time they happen. Without these side effects, the audience would not have noticed anything special. Humor is only effective if the audience does not need to be thoroughly explained what is funny.
