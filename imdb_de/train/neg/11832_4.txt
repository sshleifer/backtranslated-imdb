From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. OK, that got my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek have also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all these special effects were extremely good, but not the movie. The story of this movie was only for kids. Seriously, it's not possible for adults to really love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes that were meant for adults. I bet kids do not understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I am totally disappointed. 4.10
