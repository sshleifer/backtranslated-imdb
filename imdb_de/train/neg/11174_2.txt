Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard ship? My mouth was watering. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. After 30 minutes, I had problems staying awake. After 60 minutes, I pressed the record button and fell asleep. The next morning I finished watching. Should not have disturbed. What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "day in life ...". I guarantee you at least one and a half hours of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue terrible. Continuity not available. The camera work could have been done with a hand held Super 8 and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
