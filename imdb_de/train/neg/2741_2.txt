Spoiler!! I love Branagh, dear Helena Bonham-Carter, loved her together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THIS - <br /> <br /> I can understand the desire of an actor to stretch out to avoid the romantic clich√©. Well, they did, but really - the script continued to sound, Bonham-Carter's clothes were fancy and the occasionally sped up "madcap" series could have been an outtake from a Beatles movie, or old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. <br /> <br /> I never understood the point - other commentators say that the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser and not very smart and certainly not adorable. The bank robber shop business was painful to look at. Certainly not amusing. <br /> <br /> Bonham-Carter's realistic (presumably accepted) attempts were more realistic than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, when he was standing high on a hill and buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too instrumentalized. Was there an angel choir or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classics or something with a backbone and a bow. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
