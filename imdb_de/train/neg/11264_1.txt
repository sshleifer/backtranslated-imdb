I have not decided yet if this will replace Anaconda as "the worst movie I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values, and awesome camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing to it. I only looked at it when I read the book and wanted to see how they would turn the complicated plot into a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they did not do it. Characters appear with little or no explanation of who they are and then play no valuable role in the narrative. Even the main characters act groundlessly, so you do not care when the film reaches the climax of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit in with them, and that it may be unfair to judge this film for the book it's from. But after my friends and I came out of the cinema, I had to spend most of my trip home explaining what had happened. They even change the true meaning of the book title "Rancid Aluminum". by squeezing it into another piece of meaningless voice, just so the movie can have a cool title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of a movie from start to finish.
