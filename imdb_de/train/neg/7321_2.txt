Maybe not my genre, but the plot was terrible, as were Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed to be uncomfortable when seduced here (while he was on marijuana, why did this have to be taken in? This weakened conspiracy was significant). Also Farentino's character. would have been better if she had had more respect for a relationship. Would the movie try to say? not much.
