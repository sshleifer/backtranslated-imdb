I got this movie in the $ 5 trash can at Walmart. I would not recommend watching this train. I could give it to one of my friends when I get angry with them and want them to suffer for two hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and scanned the summary, thinking it was a war movie. I wish I had known how boring this movie would be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something would happen in this film. It's just a group of people going from one boot camp to another. The trilling arggents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of the fight in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's my saying about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to see. It was just one of those movies that you bring in and get stuck because you want to turn it off, but you're stuck with a series of hopes that could be made towards the end. It does not work After the movie was over I put it behind my TV because I was angry that I had wasted nearly two hours of my life looking at it, and another 10 minutes I wrote this review to the To warn people about it.
