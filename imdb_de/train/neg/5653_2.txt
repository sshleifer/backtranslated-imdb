Let's say so. I actually get this movie. I understand what the author / director has tried. I understand that the dialogue should be dry and emotionless. I understand that the conspiracy should not be considered climatically and stale. The author / director wanted that. A very very dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I still think that the movie is shit. It seemed like the author / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this film. It all had the same characteristics. Even the main character behaved similarly to Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. His script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me put it another way. Their sole purpose is to tear down Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that look and feel. Too bad it did not work.
