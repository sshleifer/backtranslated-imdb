If this could be a 0, it would be. From the ghastly wooden acting to the dull, trampling tempo, the puerile exploitative angle, and the pseudo-sophomoric dizziness inflicted on the sad spectators, this is a catastrophe of a movie. The plot is predictable because you are absolutely sure from the start what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring, unusual beginning to a miserable and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meager talent unearthed for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something Relentlessly bleak with the same kind of kidding, have a look at one of the Ilsa films. At least they are not apologetic and know what they are trying to do. It's a wonder that people who have no taste and no exacting standards can sometimes come together for dubious purposes. It's not scary, it's not scary interesting, and most of all, it's in no way arousing the word. It's a crime, in my opinion; It is a crime that such horribly offensive and incompetent garbage was ever conceived and provided with the necessary resources, and even more a tragedy that it is still being defended by angry misguided onlookers. <br /> <br /> Even Elvira's cheerful personality and joking manner could not mitigate the shock that this horrible film craze represents. Avoid it at all costs.
