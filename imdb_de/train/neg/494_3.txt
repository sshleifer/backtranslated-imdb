Sloppy director, witless comedy that allegedly fakes the "classic" alien invasion films of the 50s, but is really not better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any parody worse than their goal is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" are worse than almost all James Bond films). After listening to the screeching voices of the aliens for two hours, beg for calm. (* 1/2)
