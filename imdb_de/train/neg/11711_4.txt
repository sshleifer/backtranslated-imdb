A good movie, with a good lead actress, but a terrible captain. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. She is the best actor of the gang. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The first comment from the colleague who praised the movie (and wrote only ONE Review according to its IMDB.com account - and guess what movie?) is obvious a plant. While the film is beautifully filmed, it is by no means subtle or grand or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer uses. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big draw. It offers all sorts of sexual situations, but never gets through. Like a skin patch on Cinemax, but worked out with all "naughty spots". <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a bit blurry and the end and much of the third act is really a big mess Of course there is a twisting, as it is necessary for any movie to have a turn nowadays. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
