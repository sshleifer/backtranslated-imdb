Yes, The Southern Star offers a rather memorable title sung by this heavy set crooner Matt Monro. It sets the tone for this bloated and rather boring element that fails stunningly with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) to a bunch of ostriches, tons of wildlife shots, and poorly composed and boring photography by Raoul Coutard, and you'll end up in the jungle of Senegal with a thoroughly exciting game.
