Let me start by saying that I can enjoy pretty much every bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation movie from the 70's. Serious. This was terrible. <br /> <br /> There are far too many elements that Martino tries to inject, and none of them work well (except for the crocodile thing). Of course, there are some ignorant Westerners who are building a jungle resort somewhere. I do not even remember where it takes place ... how sad is that ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this indigenous tribe and its ceremonies, but in the end they disturb the "alligator god" of the river, which then upset the river continues to rage and kills said vacationers and also some tribesmen. Sounds good, yes? Well, do not worry. Until the end there is minimal violence, the special effects are so bad that it was like a kindergarten class and the love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are some serious scenes in which it looks like they are putting a camera underwater in a pool and throwing a toy alligator like an arrow into the water, and that's supposed to be the alligator be who is attacking. I'm not joking. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a matchbox van is targeted by the incredibly sinking plastic gator, which is suddenly five times the size of a van. (Only a few minutes ago he was just big enough to eat a human, but now he conjures up a full-size van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other streak I can think of, where the effects were so bad that I was pulled out of history, was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece "Rats" /> <br /> Normally I would say that Sergio Martino is an absolute must is, but this one is a must. Waste of time and definitely not worth the sticker price of No Shame for $ 15 +. This is a shame. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
