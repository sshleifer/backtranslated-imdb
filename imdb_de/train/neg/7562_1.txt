I did not see the original but just wanted to share a short message with everyone just scrolling down: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money or turn back time to warn me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I give him two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least laughed from me and the landscape of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come the sounds. The action of the film is only driven forward, because other characters Cage will give no direct answers - and he agrees !!! How that could go on for an hour of my time (much fewer days in the film) is incomprehensible to me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. They leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone would read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shady portrayal of a movie," is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Do not go on this movie. Or even borrow it on DVD.
