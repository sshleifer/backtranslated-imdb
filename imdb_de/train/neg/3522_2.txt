If you like the standard Sly-Flicks, which include exaggerated action, incredible stunts (unbelievable, which should not be complementary here) and delayed dialogue are possible. You will love this steamy mountain of goat dung. I had high hopes for the trailer. I thought that in his "remaining" days, Stalone would be forced to give in to wiser people and shoot an action film that would put a credible hero in a credible situation where history, setting, and (credible) action would win. I long for an action that is at least close enough to reality so that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would emanate from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know when you go to the theater that you'll see a comic turned into a movie. The character, the setting and everything else is incomparable with anything we could encounter. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, transforms a mountain guide into Rambo before saying "yo, Adrian!" Can tell.
