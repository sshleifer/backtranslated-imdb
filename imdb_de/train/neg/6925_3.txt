I feel much less generous with this film than others of its kind. The portrayal of madmen in this century is always so bizarre that they are a different species. Their antics are so abhorrent that they are completely fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or they have a fascination for chickens. They are on the move or are getting together. It's as if the scriptwriter says, what can I do for them without feeling like madness or even mental illness? See the wonderful human portrayal in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where the diseases are believable and real. I once worked in a state psychiatric hospital. I have not seen any of these guys. These are too smart and too calculating to bring them to life.
