I am afraid that I did not like this movie very much. Apart from a few saving graces, it's nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> J-Horror has experienced a boom in the last five to six years, but the films themselves have been repeat and carbon copies of past success in several ways. This is one of them. Basically, this is a supernatural Slasher movie. The beginning is promising with deterrent scenes from a morgue in which a dead girl has his eyes stitched together graphically, but opens it shortly thereafter. After that, however, it goes quickly downhill. <br /> <br /> To be friendly, I start with the things I like about "Gawi". On the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks good for its guy. For those who like their horror movies, there are a few well-executed (no pun intended) murder scenes. We also have some good suspense sequences / set pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are some disadvantages ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my main complaint In this film, the graphics jump and jump forward and backwards with alarming intensity. Normally this is not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same regardless of age, I was more than once confused. <br /> <br /> The performances are okay, I think (a bit difficult to say, if you do not know the language), but seem a bit stiff. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was scary enough. For a while I got bored pretty boring. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Giallo movies, I expected a lot of "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.
