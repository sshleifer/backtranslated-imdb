I have just seen Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make it a showcase. I even tried to get a blind woman to look at this and she put it down in about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? If you write that, if you want to call it that, the people in charge should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I think I read somewhere that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and far below. Did Wallmart make a good deal with it? Each store has a large, large bin on the sales area. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster or swap it with a friend, but then you're not your friend anymore.
