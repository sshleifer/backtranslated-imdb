It's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel like I have to say something. I was not looking for a splatterfest, as someone says, or even for "blood and offal". I have some respect for the sacrifices of the victims, although I really did not feel the filmmaker. They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a vessel for Dahmers sexual antics. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with the kind of curious curiosity that makes me think, "What makes a guy a serial killer?" I also ask myself about the peculiarities of the Dahmer story of which I know very little. People here seem to think that the movie did not have to cover the events of the Dahmer story. I.U. his story, what happened when he got caught, the consequences etc, but it's important! I suppose, if you are American you KNOW it all. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man as he was obvious, it requires that at least SOME of the story and the actual events be told / shown. It does not mean blood and courage, there are ways to show horrible things in a movie by implicating them or cunningly filming them without doing too much. Without even touching on what he did (I learned more about how he read the user comments on this site!), The film felt like a void. A moment with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about the REAL DAMMER, because with his lack of direction, VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, a strange depiction of homosexuality and the VERY unfortunate lack of EVERY attempt at an end, this movie is JOB. I would not recommend anyone to waste the time it takes to look at him. A definite 1 in 10 (for acting!)
