Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes work together as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds good. It leaves a lot of room for good comedy and a good story. However, in the following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt at film, no such event took place. This film became superfluous, retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite videos. Characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance," I've come to the conclusion that he should play dumb country hicks playing barbs. His acting was as boring and poor as the movie. Another actor in this unreal movie was Rosie Perez. I've always liked movies with Perez, but I've decided that I had fun working on other pieces in her career because she was not a main character and did not have so many lines of speech (Do the Right Thing). But now in White Men Can not Jump she has become a central figure with many lines, meaning that the audience has to endure her incredibly annoying and whining voice. After watching this movie (the term is loosely used) and hearing Rosie Perez more than appreciated, I can now say that I'm a white man and I'm preparing for the jump. , , from a twenty-story residential building.
