A conspiracy that sought unbridgeable disagreement and smelled of stinking stench was a judgmental devastation with one side for life and the other destroyer of a demon. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall boring effect that might have been terrible, but instead, he displayed a poor portion of faith, which, in spite of the title itself, made one laugh to death. As a fan of Masters of Horror, this ridiculous plot had broken from the beginning with its filthy depictions like a sharp old rocking chair. I see this episode as ragged from the start, nowhere else but from seeing what it's worth, and relieved when it finally came to "The End."
