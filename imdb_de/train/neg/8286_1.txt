- = contains both original and movie spoilers = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame de Paris, I also read this summer and I watched the movie today. At first I was hopeful to watch a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point. The first scenes were good, but I was really waiting for a movie scene right out of the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kissed Gringoire, I had the feeling that something was not right kiss in the book, even in the musical .. <br / > <br /> and there was a big gap why Esmeralda was judged by a magician. In the book, she teaches her goat how she responds to the clock or writes the word "Phoebus." Wait, there was not a Phoebus there? In this film he is a soldier's stuff, nothing more, the creators showed Quasimodos love and they even deposed Frollo's love. But Notre Dame was Frollo. His thoughts, his struggles between the love of God and the love of man in the film, we can not find such a thing. All we have is a villain who is really evil and kills people who collide with his thoughts. And not to mention Phoebus, not to mention love Frollo, without mention of Jehan (brother of Frollo), not to mention mother of Esmeralda (maybe it's OK, the plot would have hacked a lot), they even did not mention the actual story .. ( another PS: Frollo was not an opus dei or so cult member he is actually interested in alchemy he is trying to make gold .. he got stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> do not look at this movie, it's one Art director's edition to a real masterpiece, and if you looked at it before you read the book, then please have a book. This movie is worse than a hunchback of Notre Dame II, the animated movie Time With Notre Dame De Paris Musical .. enough said ..
