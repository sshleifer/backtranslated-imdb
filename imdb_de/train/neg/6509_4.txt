Sean Bean is great, as are the photography, the locations and the costumes. The plot, however, is a bit confused and the conclusion flat. The plot was fundamentally changed by Cornwell's novel and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better to read than viewed. Sharpe was too narrow-cut here, unlike his literary alter ego, who, despite his concern for his new role as an officer who was promoted from the ranks, seems smarter and more determined. I really enjoyed the short scene where Sharpe is stumbled upon by a "real" officer. After a short break and a piercing look, he pushes the surprised and lost officer back directly. It sets the tone for his later exams as a commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" from "10."
