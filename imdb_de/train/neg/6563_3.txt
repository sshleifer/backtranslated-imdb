Bugs Bunny accidentally lands at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida. There he meets a small Penquin, whom he tries to rescue from an Eskimo. It tries and the Penquin is adorable, but in the end it is a bit too light in the Lach section The Eskimo is not really a great foil for bugs and I have just seen much better Bugs Bunny cartoons, even other shorts, when he is with others paired with unknown antagonists. Therefore, I can not recommend this conscience without further ado. However, it is nice to see it in its uncut form. This cartoon is on disk 3 of the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1". <br /> <br /> My grade: C
