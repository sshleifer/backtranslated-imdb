This movie was and is supposed to be a blockbuster movie. This is the kind of movie popcorn should eat out and watch the eye-catching graphics. In that sense, the movie may not deliver as well as the extremely eye-catching Iron Man, but good enough. Outside the popcorn action and special effects, the movie falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. but that makes the movie just a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This movie is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it attractive to the eye than to the mind. The long-awaited and promoted characters are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never named Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well-developed. The performance of Liev Schriber surprised me positively. The rest of the characters are thrown on the track to make room for all the important eye-willows. Wolverine's character, like Sabertooth, is fully developed after 30 minutes, even though Victor brings some surprises during the film's original character and barely development to show why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that they really just had to create a bad character who could do anything they wanted and beat the name of a popular character. <br /> <br />
