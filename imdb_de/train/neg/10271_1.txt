This movie had to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The spectacle was terrible, terrible and cheesy and spoke of a predictable conspiracy! I will never see this movie again or recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time! As soon as the movie started, I realized what I was getting into. All they did for this movie was to copy scenes from many other horror movies and put them all in this one movie. The prank on the phone, Halloween night, a psycho and a knife! It is absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which in my opinion was horror movies. As for the movie, it's pretty weird how everyone talks about how awesome and scary this movie was. I mean, how do you not realize that the films are, for example, a cheap rip-off of "Scary Movie". Bring at least some good actors and then maybe it would have been a good horror movie.
