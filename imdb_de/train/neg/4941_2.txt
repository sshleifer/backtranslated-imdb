The first 50 of the Geico commercials actually did not bother me at all, so I saw them and even found them funny and amusing, BUT SERIOUSLY! This is the BEST thing these people can come up with! This show is shit! It's boring and feels like you're watching an episode of "The Office" with the characters dressed as cavemen (I know that many of you will hate it when I say that, but "The Office" just does it not for me). Okay, I understand: we have the poor guy who's just trying to keep his nose clean, and he has a fucking boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual, who actually has only a barely functioning intellect; and the fool who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I worked with these people and found them as annoying in real life as they are on TV ... why would I want to waste another 1 / 336th day of my week to see more of these guy nominations?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they have been on your head if you think later that you are still wrong because you think this is entertainment.
