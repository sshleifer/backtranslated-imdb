This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen? I do not know why? Just your everyday stories about a guy who wants to marry, and starts finding someone instead. The story was told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's going on with this movie. When these types of actors come together to make a movie that was filmed a million times ago, it's really entertaining. There are usually few smart things that are not real in any other. For some reason, it just does not hold your attention. You can pick out some funny pieces or clever ideas, but for some reason they are just not funny or in any way smart? I wish, as I explain it, but not? Do not you waste your time with it?
