Unfortunately, Busby Berkeley's first movie I've ever seen was "42nd Street." I then expected all his things to be so good. I found out that was not necessarily the case, even with my favorite classic, James Cagney, who was popular at all times of the Classical era. Oh, the musical numbers in the end are as spectacular as ever, but The story is like many of the others and pretty tiring. They always seem to be dealing with screaming, unfortunate show producers. In this movie, it's Cagney who roars so many times that after a while he gives me a headache and his character gets very thin .... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are somewhere near. "42nd Street" class, songs that you could hum for years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - that I do not like at all and was very disappointed when I watched it.
