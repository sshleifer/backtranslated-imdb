Despite the overwhelming cult that follows for this sad "documentary," I must admit that he found the film, which our party felt more of a disquieting exploit, to be a useful source of information. However, once you've seen the great stage musical, you can see what the film was in safer hands. <br /> <br /> It is believed that many of us who have actively suffered through the film have had Campy Delights, who have enjoyed their cruel fans, who were destroyed by the unpleasant suspicion that too many of us - or the ones we know - just a foot or two away from the deplorable situation of the two crazy women who live in misery and who help them to feel unable to control or escape. The film makes the viewer desperate to ask how he might have slipped someone to this level of humiliation, and offers, unlike the musical, no cautious clues or explanations, but only a horror show that will be released from neither humor nor insight. <br /> <br /> This soul-raging flatness of the movie makes achieving the stage version (which hopefully will eventually be filmed for cable) all the more remarkable. Act II is true to the film discussed in almost every detail, but strangely enough, it turns the plight of the sad inmates into music and human tragedy into art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a beautiful Act I, in which we meet the women before they drift into mutually activated insanity, and there are indications of how their isolated purgatory has arisen. In short, everything the FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> For the filmmakers (or their successors), the award-winning Criterion DVD releases include out-takes and bonus material that partially redeems the main feature - behind the film scene photography, interviews, and commentary - filling in some of the vacancies The original cut deliberately decided to skip in his urge for unadulterated horror and depression. You can not make the amateur movie satisfying, but at least make it easier to understand. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, it's just the notable stage play inspired and drawn by book author Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel, and lyricist Michael Korie, which adds a single to the original GRAY GARDENS rating ( generous) star.
