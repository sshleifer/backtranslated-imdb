At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought-provoking. Of course, if something is thought-provoking, it can be investigated. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with allusions and groundless conclusions. The connection between "what the bleep ..." between science and spirituality is in fact not anchored in science at all. The study on transcendental meditation mentioned in the film claims that group meditation can reduce crime in a particular area, in this case Washington D.C. In fact, the HRA's crime rate (homicides, rapes and injuries) in 1993 was about 30% higher than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in homicide rates during the study. Any claim that connects metaphysics with science can and has been unmasked. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a bad attempt to indoctrinate people, or a joke. Anyway, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a lengthy film about science that might be thought-provoking, consider Mindwalk (1990).
