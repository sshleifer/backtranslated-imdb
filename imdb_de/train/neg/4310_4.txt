This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star set to train a basketball team of high school boys. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, Cathy Lee Crosby plays a lead role in the title role, and she makes the script as good as possible. I think Racquel Welch would have been the better choice, but given the film's apparent television budget, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every setting, but we never see her completely naked. The story is pretty predictable and offers no surprises. A young and happy Michael Biehn has the male lead role. He is the star in the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some amusing scenes like the rich old man who runs the sports program and does not think a woman should exercise. This point is addressed throughout the film and is of course dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not lead her team through unorthodox practice sessions. It does not do anything that a male trainer would not do. There is a funny subplot involving a big and less good player who undergoes a hypnosis to pass his classes and play like the professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. It looks like everyone has had a good time shooting this movie, but for Cathy Lee Crosby, the only real reason to see him is. She is not a great actress, but she has a bright smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
