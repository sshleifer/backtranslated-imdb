Sam Mraovich may never touch a camera again. If he does, he should be arrested immediately ... at least because of the little theft. Anyone who pays even a penny to rent their garbage should apply and receive compensation. This was my first innocent look at his "work" ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good at the moment. <br /> <br /> If I bring this bitch back to the video store, I'll personally ask for it to be taken off the shelf. As an active supporter of gay cinema, I'm angry and annoyed that this twisted, exceedingly untalented man-kid is allowed to distribute and pack something like that, with a nasty, handsome boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Fork, who fortunately has no other acting credits in IMDb ) and an interesting summary on the back, which is used as bait, and then market as "movie rental". Trust me, it has no place in any shelf anywhere; It's just not a movie in the truest sense of the word. Insulting, irresponsible trash like this can only be detrimental to the efforts to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!). Fork is not as flattering in the movie as on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, homely Mroavich adds to his disgusting, sad-looking batter-boy nudity. This "thing" he has "assembled" is an inverted vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, as I understand it, spend a similar dirty garbage) are terrible. Mraovich deliberately poses as an absolute non-talent (in all areas) and desperately tries to draw attention to every "loser". He is to be regretted.
