Defining an abomination in the sense of Webster's dictator is "a cause of disgust or disgust." If anyone can think of a more fitting word or definition for Alone in the Dark than this one, let me know because that's the best I can think of. However, I do not feel that this word in any case describes how really awful this movie is. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with two of my roommates. One has a very similar taste, the other is an action / adventure guru. This latter guy usually does not care about the size of the storylines, as long as the movie contains a lot of explosions, he will be content to go away alone in the dark. Little to our surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I immediately knew why. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of a movie, and unfortunately I have to admit that it only gets worse from there. The opening scene consists of a 5-minute scrolling text that is told. However, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterates would even realize the idea of ​​PAYING to see this movie. This first scene is not only the longest scrolling text in the history of cinema, but makes no sense either. It seems like we are completely separating movies in the same sequence. One is about an ancient civilization and its manipulation on one portal, the other is about a mad scientist and his experiments with orphans. If you are reading this and confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then begin the terrible plot, the acting, the effects and the camera work. Tara Reid is terrible as an actress. She does not do anything to believe for even a second that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, unconvincing and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing man has ever created. All the time, I and the roommate with a similar taste ask questions like: What is that? And what's up? Apart from this garbage we have told some sequences of Slater himself. Are you good? NO. Do you explain something? NO. As an audience, do we have the slightest idea why we should care about what happens? NO again. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they pretend to care for each other. But then BAM ... sex scene. Again I do not know. <br /> <br /> A good, oh I do not know, 30 seconds after the end of this sad scene we have a shooting fight with about 20 military and a similar number of extraterrestrial things. This is set to a Heavy Metal track and causes more brain bleeding than you ever thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that were not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no main rogue. There is the scientist and there are the "strange" things. Once the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill, ordering them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the commander-in-chief of these things? Why are you listening to him? Again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reid going to an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the strange things break through? Did the military tell you? Who knows ... and who cares? I do not have and you will not. <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it has been said that strangers are killed by sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's the middle of the day and it's bright as possible. Maybe the alien bought sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. <br /> <br /> After the movie was over, I ran outside the theater, every 6 feet 6 inches from me, and waved my arms and my afro movement shaking anyone not to see this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure roommate (who considers a movie that just cut a 2-hour blast into a movie as the best ever created) admitted that plot holes were very obvious in this film /> To summarize the CRAP FEST, I give him a 0.0 / 10 and would lower it if I could. <br /> <br /> Unrestricted the worst movie ever made. I would not wish this movie to my worst enemy.
