- A small time mask brings the local mobboss out of a lot of money. Of course the mob boss wants his money back and he does not care who he has to kill to get it. Punk asks his friend and an old gangster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If that sounds ridiculous, that's it. The whole idea that this Izod-wearing punk with dune buggies could stop one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is stupid. His friend may be good with a gun, but he has a group of trained killers. The old gangster is little more than a comic relief and no real help when it comes to the mob. There is also a signing of how the friend's father was killed by the mob boss years ago, but little has been done about it, and it does not help the movie at all. <br /> <br /> - The mob boss Mr. Scarface is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has something on his cheek like a shave. Palance is just as ineffective as the rest of the cast and does what he has to do to get a paycheck. <br /> <br /> - I've seen some pretty good Italian crime / poli strips lately, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them. Instead, check Syndicate Sadists or Revolvers.
