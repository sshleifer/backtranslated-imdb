"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for Midwest Meth, but it appears as a tough R rating "Reefer Madness." <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, and meth is terribly pernicious, as addiction and as it destroys people, families and communities. But those characters, who are either stupid or ridiculous, and the stunning storyline will not teach anyone that lesson. <br /> <br /> While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has a certain charisma on screen, his partner, Diane Foster, plays a ridiculously stupid, innocent, drug-corrupted, innocent woman who has been starred by Susan Sarandon. " I was really sorry for her, for the completely unnecessary nudity she had been through, and it was only at the end of the film that I realized that I should think that these two were recently graduates of the High School was, to explain some of their naivety, because we are bombarded with their school photos, but if so, they looked even older than the people on "The OC." Although they have a good chemistry on the canvas, they are a pale one Imitation of a pair of badlands. <br /> <br /> The guest stars are badly used Michael T. Weiss, who was so good at TVs "The Pretender", is a ridiculous and corrupt prosecutor A brute force is just crazy because its character pretty much ruins the social meaning of the movie. Rosanna Arquette has to be even slimmer as she rolls around for David Cronenberg as a very low livia soprano. John Savage even has to announce the old Baby Boomer excuses that I made Pot, but that's worse. A goth chick appears, with the strange explanation that she is a stripper of Des Moines. The obligatory Latino drug dealer appears - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the interior view of meth usage is very vivid, with fairly frightening hallucinations. We definitely see that they go crazy. <br /> <br /> While the locations in Iowa are very well used (including an amusing scene of a propane gas attack), the accents and ecclesiastical references are confusing to Southern Baptist. Guns seem to be used by law-abiding and law-breaking citizens here more than in any drug dealing movie in the downtown area. The songs of Iowa's best-known bard Greg Brown are consistently used, but strangely not listed in the credits. I hope they were used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught this on the commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it got considerable - and inexplicably - buzz.
