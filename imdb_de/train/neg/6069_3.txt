It always surprises me how to take a great actor and waste him in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to that of Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can not stand it when actors have the same fun over more than one movie. I think it's getting old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this film, but then the story has been told a million times. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his imagination shows in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> But since De Niro is IN this movie, it's a draw if you're a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. To see De Niro at its best, read "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land" or check out "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Do not waste your time with this drivel. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
