I bought this DVD because it contains Kari and it says MPaA ratings; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> the right one, IMO, should specify; "Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" should come after a comma, not a "and", as it has a big difference in meaning. I think many people who have seen this movie will agree that sexuality and nudity almost do not exist. My first impression with regard to the mpaa rating was that I would see something like "lively" film. That's why I felt cheated. As far as the story goes, it was after all the people who are really interested in the story, when the beautiful Kari is in it. I know, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Of course, that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
