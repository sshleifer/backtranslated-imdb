I can not tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the least interesting, and the plot does not exist. So after waiting for the lives of these characters to influence each other in the hope that the last two and a half hours have led to a significant ending, what do we get ??? A storm of frogs. Well, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but above all it was presented absolutely without dissolution, and secondly it would be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (a significant portion of the population ) or Charles Fort (even more). As a well-read person, I considered the film a self-indulgent, poor imitation of a Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well, to be honest
