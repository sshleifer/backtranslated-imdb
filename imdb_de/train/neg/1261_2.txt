I'm a Jean Harlow fan because she had star quality. I do not think her films are good and I do not think she was a good actress, but she was certainly great at comedy. Every comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But maybe this movie is more of a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. It has always impressed me to believe that Harlow's beautiful body was that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks beautiful.
