I've just seen American Pie: Beta House and I have to say that was such a garbage heap of crap. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not be called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you know from the title of the movie, Beta House is a Brotherhood. First semester, girls and the most original part of all fall in love. Of course, Stifler is the guy who knows about the chicks, who, together with his colleagues, is trying to do another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and very fake. It's just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college fight for who gets the whole thing (stuff). Conclusion: terrible drama + boring script + wrong use of the American pie series = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give two out of ten, although most of it sucked, there was a lot of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
