Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) has staged and interpreted this curious film, the second part of a kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma '95 Manifesto, though it really looks like that. I'm not sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They perform pretty well, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there's something about the movie I do not like. The sex scenes are way too long. It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic crap, I do not know exactly where it stands. Sure, it's not a bad movie, but I do not suggest people to see it, and I'm not telling them not to look at it. Just do what you want. If you feel curious and open-minded, give it a try, you'll like it.
