This movie is just awful, the eye candy that Ben plays can make up for everything else that's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The author / director / producer / main actor, etc. probably had a good idea. The idea was to create a film dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crime and almost Any other topic that concerns a gay man of those times, but trying to ram any topic into such a poorly designed movie, does this. These circumstances are not fair. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the casting very ordinary, but the dialogue and action is only sad. The homosexual brother is played by most camp actors, and there's absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters (I think I've seen more passion in a cornflakes ad). The acting is stiff and the dialogue forced (a scene in which the brother feeds the detective with his ranks, was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train crash did not do this. I put every other trash in distribution, and when he thinks about it, I have some advice - ONLY DO NOT ,
