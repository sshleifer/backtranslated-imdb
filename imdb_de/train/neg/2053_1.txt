Why do you insist on making great movies like "High Noon", "From Here to Eternity" and this one? <br /> <br /> Why do you think the color is more compelling for a viewer than strong black and white? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on wearing this dirty baseball cap? ... it made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why should someone spend something? four hours suffer through that? <br /> <br /> Look at the original. Then you do not have to ask WHY.
