This movie was crap with a big "C." The opening scene was promising. However, this "promise" came shortly after the viewer found out where the plot was going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Morty, which was pretty scary in the original movie, just looks silly in this case. It was obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And who, by the way, believes that "Morty" is one of the weirdest names on planet Earth? "Jimmy" or "Fred" rank high on the horror value) Henry-freakin'-Kissinger Wood Statute , "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be about as scary as "Morty". And then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's tombstone with --- "a sledgehammer?", You might suspect - "a two-by-four?", Someone might risk it. No, he hits his father's headstone with a branch - a damned twig Worse than that, when the characters go away, the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> There is also a Native American who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently does nothing Morty-maintenance: He perpetuates creepy Morty legends, warns those who sneers, and even repairs Morty's arm, if he is damaged during a childish prank, but despite his respect and tenderness towards Morty Morty leaves a rat? No. <br /> <br /> The film is long and several people die in a way that suits their worst fears. This movie is a real Yawner. Do not rent it.
