Unlike another reviewer, I think that this is WELL-written, especially the more fictitious it is because more imagination would be required; and acted well because there were no other characters to share the focus of this over ten-minute, well-done monologue. But I'm just not entertained by such solemn, pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten not-so-untypical stories and problems that illustrate how the life of each (or part of) is intended for the film. On the other hand, I also think badly about reality TV shows. So if that's your bag, you might like it. It's the kind of stuff that would make good phone and / or internet gossip; but absolutely without any other than verbal action. And although each speaker is female, I do not skip gender.
