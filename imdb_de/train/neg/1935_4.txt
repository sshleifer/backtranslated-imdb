Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely redundant sequel to two great fantasy movies. The movie delivers the spell effects you'd expect, but on all other fronts it fails painfully. The actors are all playing extremely stupid cartoons. You still have to be in diapers to find your slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable and the development is sometimes unpredictable and often slow. In the end, the movie looks like old Godzilla movies, including shabby, larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) mind with Godzilla head. Maybe I could have smiled if I had expected a camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what trash fantasy fans have to endure successful formula. You will not be able to do it anymore: The Cash Cow is dead like a Dodo.
