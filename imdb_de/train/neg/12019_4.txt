I've read some good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface", but for anyone not interested in the genre of Italian gangster films, like me, the picture probably does not make much sense. After the first setup with the ten million lira scams, the picture developed into a rather routine revenge strike with a slight twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot was confused for me by the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he is about the only one who gave this picture a look with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it unbelievable that Manzari's thugs chasing Tony through the streets had not really gotten out before Tony even put them in his hands. Jack Palance was almost overtly squandered in an anticlimactic finale and was more irritated by the US working title "Mr. Scarface". I've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they do not all work. I think, in this case, my first look at a spaghetti gangster strip did not quite work.
