I was intrigued to see a little-watched 2008 movie win the Oscar for Best Picture of 2009, so I went to The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I'd spent for the two hours was the bleak confirmation that this movie had won prizes just for off-the-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest you will ever see. Unless it's about to be yet another Bourne Identity tribute with gritty, annoying "wobbly cams" visualizations, it shows all the hallmarks of a second-rate daytime soap opera with respect to the lenses. <br /> is threadbare, the characterizations are about as well-developed as rejected comics by Beetle Bailey, and the dialogue - in cases where the film gives up being "minimalist" and, for no apparent reason, one or two soldiers in Real Chatterboxes transforms, there are some of the worst ever recorded. To be fair, under the circumstances the actors do the best they can, but not enough to show how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie feels like it's a kind of "mockumentary". that they were timed was humorless and therefore edited as well as possible to be a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours with this movie, it's two hours you'll never need Get back and two hours to repent for the rest of your life.
