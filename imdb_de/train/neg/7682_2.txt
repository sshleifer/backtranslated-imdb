THE COBWEB, born in 1955, is a star-star cast that is staged by LILLIAN GISH and Silent Screen Veterans SUSAN STRASBERG. In an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what's the movie about you? Doctor & patient relations? Shock therapy treatment? No, this howler is all about who can choose the curtains for a psychiatric clinic! You think I'm joking? You will not believe your eyes as you see this incredible story turned into a movie! Progressive shrink pain Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants everyone in the hospital to be involved in the design, selection and execution of the necessary new curtains. McIver's wife played with marble, GLORIA GRAHAM also wants to contribute two cents to this monumental task. This also applies to the longtime employee Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you're kind of wondering if he really was so involved in the details because he was worried about his marriage to the wart JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story. What did they think?
