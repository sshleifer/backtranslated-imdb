RUN ... do not go away from this movie !!!!! The film is aimed at very young children and will bore you to tears. When the Gamera trilogy of the 90s raised the bar, this movie simply lowered it. It is progressing slowly and the monster fight is good, but rarely seen. This film lifted me dry in the cat box. Only a very bad offer after a phenomenal 90s series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS beyond this point !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why Gamera fans of the '90s series will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child trying to cope with the death of his mother, and fears he will lose Baby Gamera after a fight knew his dad saw the adult camera die. You might see the adult gamera a minute at the beginning of the movie. He gets kicked in the ass by some gyaos and destroys himself ??? He looks old and lethargic. Besides, he does not look like a camera you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and crowded. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the movie looks like a pokemon. Big-eyed and sweet ... it will remind you of Godzilla Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is too cute now. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the pace of a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I saw this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slow this movie is moving. I've seen an SUV full of fat people driving faster on a mountain road. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little Kaiju-time on screen. Final Wars actually had many more and better fights, albeit briefly. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take over the title role. The friend of all children's topics and the bad writing killed the original Gamera series in the 70's and the story repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera films left Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why back to a failed formula? This was supposed to be a new trilogy, and the bad ticket sale left no hope that this story would go on (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He sounds like an elephant with a sore throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This film could spawn a new Olympic event ... Imagine a relay race where very young children are sent to the danger zone. You have to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents Oh yes ... right where they send their children to a Kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but below average for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was shown by the apple-sized baby Gamera flying. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is just not what adult Kaiju fans expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and that shows. It's a mix of ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. A kudos, if you know all 3 references. <br /> <br /> It's best to rent or have a look once when you buy it to complete the DVD series.
