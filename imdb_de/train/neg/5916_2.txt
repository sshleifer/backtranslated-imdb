The torturously slow pace of this film was probably the explicit intention of the director to convey what it was like to grow up as a village teenager in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow "plot" and general film style so impersonal that it was completely alienating, especially to a Western audience. Sometimes I had difficulty distinguishing some characters from each other because they were taken from such a distance. After two hours I was totally taken care of. As someone who is not only interested in music, but is also very interested in the history and culture of China (and, by the way, not a stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not deal with a single character and found nothing I was looking for could engage. The question is: If I did not like it, who would like it on earth? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of pretty much every other Chinese director I've ever met. This painful effort is simply not enough. I would be sorry if Chinese cinema was measured by this benchmark.
