Yes, I saw the rough cuts. The unprocessed sex scenes. The dark scenes. Almost equal to the movie "The Need" for terrible acting. This movie is as bad as bad movies. The bad script, bad spectacles, bad effects, bad scenes, bad stunts make everything bad. The best "actors" in the movie were the Lap Dancers who hired them for the Vampire Extras. Sean Harry, the "foppe actor", as someone else puts it, makes a matchstick talented here. Its amazing ability to drive a car badly when it's obviously shaken up by people on the hood (check the reflection in the windshield), its inability to drive to the left, which is class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. and his notable use of a toy weapon that could not even disguise the props as a real weapon. The other actors on screen were barely able to deliver their lines. It was like waiting halfway for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' were sooo good that they were so good The guys who did it took off their real names from the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, then rent this movie ... then there are lots of good comedies that are just as funny do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
