This is available in a "Drive In Double" feature from Dark Sky Films, and since I had just finished "Barracuda" I looked at it too. This is a movie that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> We start with two young ladies roaming the streets of a strange city, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at necklaces from a Chinese seller and try on Chinese clothing in a shop, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And meanwhile, these girls are being persecuted by two men who end up taking the deception they do not need to chase the girls through the city and eventually catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it from? In a flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know she had this coin? Really hard to say. <br /> <br /> Well, back when these two women were 10 years old, they were on a boat with their sisters and their sister's friends, stopping to take a breather in their tanks back to his home dock, just to get his grandpa out and invite the "young" us to herbal tea with grandma. But not everyone has tea, Todd went back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then, when they're not there, blew up the boat, and when they returned to the house, their friends mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems that these "kind people" are growing their own vegetables, but they wait for the flesh to come over for a spell and serve it to Herbal Tea Island, but now they are returning, escorted by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, though no one has ever shown the girl where it was before. There also seems to be someone on the island, and the thugs are beginning to die mysteriously, one at a time, and since there are only three, it does not take long. And there is even a kind of happy ending that will make the viewer as baffled as in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with trouble problems and combined with no theatrical abilities they are funny on the border. The hillbilly family also has no acting skills, although the grandfather Hank Worden, who appeared in many films and television programs. The action is confusing, the locations are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth a visit to let you think (or say), right? 4 out of 10 very bizarre.
