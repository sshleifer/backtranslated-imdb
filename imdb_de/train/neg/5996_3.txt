Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Performers: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds are going! <br /> <br /> And so began Thunderbirds, a favorite of my childhood. When I heard that they were making a Thunderbirds movie, I was thrilled. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people as Thunderbird 4 plunged deep into the world. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics did not, but I wanted to go anyway. As long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. So I went to the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50. Everyone else was over thirty and under ten. Probably the most unpleasant theater experience I've ever had? <br /> <br /> The film (which is supposed to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest member of the Tracy family. He spends his days saving people like the rest of his family, but he's too young. One day he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) imprisons the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This means that he has to outsmart The Hood's henchmen and save his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the action sounds like a normal episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once it's done to film, what a mess we have in our hands. First of all, the film was intended for children, much like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like grown-ups and gave us pretty advanced plans for children's programs. On the other hand, the plot mutes as she tries to pull away from the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie intended to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children while totally missing them both. Lame jokes, cartoon-like sounds, and stupid antics that nobody really enjoys are omnipresent in this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wishes he'd never directed that, giving a solid performance, considering the script all was given. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood and played the role extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about the hoodlums of The Hood, left over from old Looney Tunes cartoons movie is that I had fun while watching the movie. But when the light came up again, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was $ 8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps. Nevertheless, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mess. Instead of a big "go" I have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the movie had been like the first ten minutes, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of the Thunderbirds name. However, we get a movie that is just die-hard Thunderbirds fans (if you want to see your childhood torn to pieces) or that should be extremely boring. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
