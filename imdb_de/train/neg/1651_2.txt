A poorly written script without sympathetic characters. As a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about two conceited friends cheating to put women to bed (no sex scenes), and another friend (half discriminatingly weird) who sometimes cheats, but is mainly considered the man who masters. The three friends meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow, that does not really look like romance. The three boys stop being friends when they were separated with her. She pushed her out of her friendship because they betrayed women. - A bad movie
