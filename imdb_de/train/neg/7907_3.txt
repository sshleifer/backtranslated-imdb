A brilliant performance by Alix Elias highlights an otherwise misdirected and confused pile of garbage. I've seen this movie maybe 12 times and with every pass I find less and less pleasure. Why are Munchies so relish? Is this ever explained? Are they a reflection of our wanton, booric "animal selves"? If so, why not make it more obvious? Why not just throw back a touch of the subtlety that plagues this film and make that connection explicit? Another part of this film that bothers me to no end - motorcycles. The jacket that bears the little monster on the front page seems to point to the street. The sunglasses say "pretty cool guy". With all that, I am ready for Easy Rider the Muppets. I only get Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series if you're a fan of small, raging reptile dolls - you'll get the treatment you deserve.
