This movie has everything. the skilful camera work reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone, the rigorous action of "heat", the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer film, the witty dialogue of a tarantino font and the epic feeling of "godfather" <br /> <br /> The judge retains the character, but also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of robert de niro's portrait of jake la motta in a raging bull. The action scenes are really breathtaking, not as bullit shows a movie with such a high octane, yet stylish car scene. The special effects reach the limits of technology and filmmaking. The Independance Day has set the standard that this film clearly matches and was clearly surpassed. <br /> <br /> Overall great acting from the cast list (like an Oscar night party invitation list!), Stylish Places, Thrilling Action, and a Tight Script.
