This is not one of the better films by Arbuckle or Keaton, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of saddling all his heavy drinking, and she takes him to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Well, once Arbuckle arrives, he inadvertently eats a thermometer and is taken to the surgery. Then he escapes and is hunted over the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. Finally, the employees escape despite being chased around, and then it becomes clear that the girl is crazy and that Arbuckle is soon conquered again. However, he awakens and everything AFTER the surgery was a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl and dr. Keaton is not as tall as an incompetent as he seemed in a dream. <br /> <br /> A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Sure, making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low, but in his time, laughter was guaranteed. I would also laugh if there was only something funny to answer for! A lot of energy and that's all. <br /> <br /> For your information - during one of the chases, Fatty wonders about a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds?). And shortly thereafter he moves back to a post on which the number 5 was just painted. The five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a normal participant. HOWEVER, the number on Fatty's shirt should have appeared backwards, but was pulled forward - a mistake, as they would have realized that the mirror image was a reverse image 5.
