We all know that a movie never quite lives up to the book, but that's extraordinary. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially patterned to the same character, most of the subplots and main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely downplayed, which made her seem like a much flatter figure than the ones I met in the book. In the book, we learn more about her powers and the important implications she had for so many people, who were a key element in the family's life. In the movie she was just a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero third - incidentally is the son and thus comes after Segundo-second -) and his connections with Esteban and his grandson of Pancha Garc√≠a (not the son he did) It will be in two Cut halves and downplayed its importance. <br /> <br /> One of the most basic things in the book, which is as good as impossible for the movie: This is called "The House of Ghosts". Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family should revolve around the "big house on the corner", as it is called in the novel so often. The house is of fundamental importance to the story, but the film unjustifiably places it in a mere background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I never would have thought that such a juicy, flat movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
