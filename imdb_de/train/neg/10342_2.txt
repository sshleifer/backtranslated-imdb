Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce moves uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein is certainly of the opinion that this is the first and his selfish achievement in a minor role underlines the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players of the film. Usually I do not like being so intrusive, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books, and seeing what they've done with it literally drives me crazy.
