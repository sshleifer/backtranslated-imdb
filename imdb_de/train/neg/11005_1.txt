This film shows a series of sketches that partly overlap. I recognized the end of the movie late, at first it only irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many episodes in this film have no apparent punchlines and simply try to deal with this fact using absurdity and obscenity. The attempt to stay in the comedy without having any funny parts fails. <br /> <br /> My staff and possibly the subjective result after seeing this movie (My God, it hurts when I call it "movie") A brave attempt to make something out of nothing. But it failed. At least the director made something of nothing. But it is not good. <br /> <br /> Many movies were not as funny as they were planned, but this movie surpasses them all. It is the real manifestation of the worst scenario of filmmaking. To correct me, it is even worse. A movie with such bad gags that they are not funny at all. It's not even fun to see the lead actor, the writer and the director (by the way, all three of the same guy) go under, drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is too bad for that.
