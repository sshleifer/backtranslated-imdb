I saw "Rachel's loft" and thought I would enjoy a pleasant ride. This should not be the case. Visceral yes, but enjoyable? That would be big, fat, no! The only reason I gave him a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen (very briefly) appears as one of the most reprehensible characters of the movie. I'll never know how they've ever lured Mr. Hansen into this ... work. The story idea is interesting, but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. The only thing worse is the special effects. YIKES !!! I have seen better effects in a primary school game. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I heard they were hired at Mel's Diner! There are very few well-made Inde films from Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
