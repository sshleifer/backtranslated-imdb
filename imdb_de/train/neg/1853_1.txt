This film, not a correction, that THING, that hideous abomination from the burning caverns of hell should have been killed before he ever left the writer's head. I could not possibly develop enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let us try anyway. Terrible, bad, disgusting, tasteless, crap, vomiting, bad, bad, vile, evil, lazy, there just are not enough words in English The "conspiracy" refers to a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, not important. The killer snowman runs away killing people. How could one ask, can a snowman kill someone? In a tasteless way, which means you'll have to remove your eyes if you can not stand this styrofoam snowman anymore. In a way that will make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so that you no longer have to put up with its snow weeks. Do not look at this movie! Destroy it on sight! For the sake of your soul, do not look it!
