This film is a calculated effort to earn the success of Sex in the City and four weddings and a funeral. If they called it a sex at a funeral, they might have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can not get up. The characters unlikely radiate bright dialogues, but they never seem humanly recognizable in any way. An arbitrary, meaningless act follows another to advance what is going on in a plot, and one soon tires the falseness of the whole enterprise. Andie MacDowell gets points for playing her little heart, but the running awards are stolen by Imelda Staunton, just like a cop (do not they have a height requirement?). Mrs. Staunton does not seem to take a wrong step. Could we say the same thing about the author-director? <br/> <br/> If you are teased by Notting Hill as being fraudulent, stay out of this area. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.
