The reviews for this movie were at best lukewarm, while the expectations were high: a big budget, lots of popular faces, a pretty funny idea, and a lead actress everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's supposedly humorous journey into the fantasy world fails in every way to entertain the audience (I have not heard a single laugh throughout the presentation) and goes through the pageless story and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign the magic that wanted it. The 90 minute movie here is sterile with awkward directing and some good actors doing their best to work as professionals in a feature that certainly does not seem like a great idea on set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches combined with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
