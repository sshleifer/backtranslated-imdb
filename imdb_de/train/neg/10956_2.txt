I bought this movie from Gamestop's discount, and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself has been left behind and they use ten different monkeys throughout the movie that are unlikely to resemble each other. Not to mention that they use a stunt double, who is just a little guy in costume and makes a desperate attempt to embody a monkey. The director probably committed a murder with the chimpanzees after previewing the film for another cheap movie by Warner Bros. and he eventually owed the studio money. It does not help that he was not even notorious for his terrible work. He was not even known to produce a poop-chute movie. Why was this movie ever made?
