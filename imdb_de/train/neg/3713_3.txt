DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is such a deceptive and desperate comedy you get home with The couch watching a Chris Rock stand-up comedy on TV looks like a sky. The film is based on the 1978 published movie "Heaven Can Wait". That was a good movie, and that's good to show how a group of aspiring scriptwriters can turn decent stuff into rubbish. The directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost every goal. From concept to storytelling, Down to Earth fails miserably; This is an incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a lousy stand-up comedian, both in his role in this movie and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager (Frankie Faison) even regrets him being baptized on the amateur night at a local theater. Shortly after the script determines its lack of talent, the character is killed by a raging truck. The death played by Eugene Levy made a mistake in taking Lance before his number was exceeded. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to catch up with Lance for the rest of his time on Earth, as long as he uses the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The name of the old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann) who robs him of his money. But that's fine because Lance fell in love with Mr. Wellington in a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are plans to kill Wellington, Lance trying to get a better body, and Sontee's confused feelings about a hospital situation involving Mr. Wellington's finances. <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a meaningless and unconvincing love story full of gadgets and recycled material. The biggest problem with that is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he will not be missing in most movies. All characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is handy for the love story. We believe that a young woman would fall in love with Lance, but in fact she is an old, gray-haired guy. That's not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The funny situation with a joke is to watch an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man. What inspires laughter, however, is when characters come into conflict without their knowledge. Just look at "There is something about Mary". In the funny scenes, the characters are exposed to unpleasant experiences and not to their will. Here, Lance knows he's in an old man's body and does things old men would not normally do. If Lance did not know the body he was in, it might have potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: We never knew Mr. Wellington from the beginning, if we do not know how he was originally. To top it all off, Chris Rock has to be the center of attention here and makes the character too much like rock. He recites simple routine jokes that are boring and painful; His dialogue is so obvious, wooden and straightforward. I hated the humor of the movie. There are so many funny jokes and terrible funny situations. It's like watching Chris Rock as Chris Rock, not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Let us emphasize the positive aspects of "Down to Earth". Mark Addy is no worse off than "The Flintstones at Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well staffed, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. These are all the good qualities that I can mention at this point, and if you give me another week to remember, it's unlikely I'll come up with more.
