What a time we live when someone like this Joe Swan - no matter what the hell - is a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where is the new harvest of filmmakers with brains AND talent? We need them bad and hell with Mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, just as the characters in the movie stand for nothing. It's this dreadful, so-called Gen Y, that's full of bored idiots, some of whom explain themselves to filmmakers without having to deal with the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Recent films like this show how stupid young, so-called "filmmakers" can be, if they believe, without a script, without directing, without thinking, without legitimate "camera works" (all horrible shot) DV), no Editing, nothing at all, stands for "rebellious" or "advanced" films. No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just masturbation of the cinema (and actually there is a "shaky shot" in the face, so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Watch the first movies of any seasoned "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Duke that Swan, no matter what the hell, go every year to the SXSW and is celebrated as a kind of courageous new talent. It is crap! I can not imagine that anyone would like that, and everything else that this so-called filmmaker did (everything I've seen) is just as bad (the newer stuff is clearly meant to appeal to a mainstream audience, one of the sitcoms invocations). Be aware, unless you are a friend or family member of those involved ... If you are a family member or a friend, you may be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations. , <br /> <br /> Full of garbage. This is not art. This is the ultimate opposite of it.
