The only reason why I did not rate this is because Sibrel shows that he knows the technical aspects of a movie. It's a tech-savvy movie. <br /> <br /> That is, it's a movie based on lies and distortions that can easily be refuted. Most of the documentary is used with propaganda techniques to beat the space program rather than actual facts. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that the landings were forged can easily be refuted if you know something about orbital mechanics. Do not let Bart Sibrel benefit from your curiosity.
