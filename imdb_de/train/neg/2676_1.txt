** Possible Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> This straightforward video mess combines a heroine, Grade Z effects, Nazis, a mummy, and endless lesbian movies. It is still boring. The video is only 45 minutes long, it only SEEMS like Eternity. The only good part is one of the Blooper outtakes, where the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist into a chair - and the foot of a villain is almost squeezed under a chair leg. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch golf, bowling or tennis on TV instead.
