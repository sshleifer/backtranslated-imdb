I can not really say what I think about this movie, it violates the guidelines. I've seen a lot of movies and that was the worst movie ever. Extremely small budget In the slaughterhouse scenes, I was able to do a better job with an 8mm camera and a monkey crew. It was so bad that I just registered to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, the movie rental was not enough. But that's my value of 2 cents. I suggest lending it from a poor juice that has rented it and is watching itself. Because I would certainly not waste the money myself. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope that you will not be made at the rental station if it will not refund your money. =)
