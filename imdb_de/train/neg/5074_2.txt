I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "Festival des Nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from him, I have to say that I have been disappointed just as many people in the audience as Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa from start to finish. Of course it is stupid. But I could not help it. The stories are quite different, but the worlds depicted are very similar. And from this perspective, "a tree of palms" definitely can not stand the comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it is technically quite good, boredom is left over ... in the end, I advise the complete lack of originality that you should not worry about it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a little hard, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
