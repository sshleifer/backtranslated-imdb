Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-standing original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid for the movie when it hit the cinemas in 1985. He is terrible. Almost everything fails. First of all, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a bad choice - almost as bad as it was when John Huston was hired to mutilate ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they are chopping up the songs and the CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the game was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted to show a chance, what they can do and when they got their chance - they could not take their eyes off them. But this cast only comes from dancing, makes a "nice" song, but none of them makes a spark. Look at the cast on IMDb - none of them has really done much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). This movie train wreck does not capture for a second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. A total strike! (But even if they try to stifle the music, the great music sometimes rises and reminds people how great the score was).
