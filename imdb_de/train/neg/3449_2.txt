Luckily, there is no video of this would-be Western that was a floating vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was staggering. The story of a weasel that lives on the reputation of its great gun brother and is torn out of the city by villains to regain its city dwellers with a new courage must have been written by a backroom writer. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, poorly understood and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to completely deviate from the other reviewer who has classified it as "... undervalued ...". The critics slammed it at the time and rightly so. You'll have to see it in the last show if you get up too late and suffer from insomnia. But if you can stand it, you have more power than most of my fan friends.
