This movie was not completely cruel, but it was pretty bad. the acting was really good! Jeffrey combs has done a damned good job as a mad scientist, which is a specialty for him if you do not know such things: D. bill forsythe .. well, I'm not EXACTLY why he was in this movie. He's way too good for this stuff and his role was not exactly demanding. I rented this because of these two clues and was not really disappointed. I mean, it's a movie about half a man / half shark. They are not Shakespearean people. Apart from the action, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, I would like to say that cinematography also leaves a lot to be desired. There were shots where they tried to look "cool," but it ended up hiding the scene or just coming out of the window. She also blew it often when they had a decent dialogue, and cut off prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. But if you're a friend of Jeffrey combs, it's worth trying it out. He does a great job and does what he can with the character. Forsythe is not bad either and either the female lead. Crap, if I can remember her name. The bottom line is that I would not waste any time otherwise.
