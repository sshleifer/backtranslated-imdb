This was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Everybody in the movie tried to be serious, that's what makes this movie so funny. I mean, come to a human body with a shark. Can it be funnier? Good work sci-fi ensures that the comedy films come. I never thought that movies could be hindered even more. If you continue, you must rename the sci-fie channel to comedy sci-fi channel or something similar. I can not wait to release the next blockbuster movie from Sci-Fi /> I'll be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of alcohol and I'll be ready to laugh again !!!
