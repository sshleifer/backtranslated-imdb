The film has the longest, most tormented and tormented end of a movie I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones gives such a wood performance. I was surprised that she did not go up in flames as she approached the candles in the film. I do not really remember her from the other films she made (a blessing I have to believe). I never criticize an actor's performance because there are too many things in the movie that can affect it the ATROCIOUS script emerges. Granted, she has lines and situations that would cause trouble for Meryl Streep, but I swear sometimes that she read from a cue card on the set for REAL! The plot, the dialogue and the tempo are as bad as you will ever see, but there is no excuse for this performance nor for the director who would allow it. I'm sorry for the other actors The little Indian / breakfast club was pushed into a rotting burrito and then redone by a director and director.
