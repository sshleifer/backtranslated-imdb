This "movie" is more of a music video. Kusturica said in an interview in 2004 that he likes to make music while making films and makes films while playing music. The best part of "Promise me this" is the music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br/> <br/> Kusturica said in the same interview that the dialogues in the movies are like noise to him. "Promise me that this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like a music video for the first 30 minutes and some points later, but it had a nice plot. "Promise me" has no plot. I was expecting this movie with great expectations because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters, who also participated in "Life is a Wonder". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise," and to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, which I identified as being written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to create his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the Gypsy Gypsy scripts) and Black Cat White Cat said in an interview that Kusturica never followed the script. "Black cat white cat" was the only script that Kusturica said he would not touch. According to Gordan Mihic, Kusturica eventually returns to the script, and if not, he does not make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise me this". He should have followed the screenplay by Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is called a "comedy," but there are very few moments that made me laugh. The comedic moments are in the same style as "Black Cat White Cat" but are not all that funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people who liked "Promise me this", they find it very positive movie.
