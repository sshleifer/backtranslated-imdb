Drew Barrymore is an actress who has had bad times not only in her career but also in her personal life. After being a wonderful child actress, she stepped into the darkness with mediocre films of inferior quality. While recovering from this dark past, this movie is reminiscent of Drew Barrymore's worst days. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an interesting premise reminiscent of Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; with a storyline that deals with multiple personality disorder that turns the story into a horror / thriller. Barrymore plays the role of Holly Gooding, a young woman who wants to start a new life in California after a traumatic event in the past when her other personality killed her mother. Suddenly her past returns. Follow her while her evil personality is back in her life and ready to ruin her newly found peace and her new love. In the midst of chaos, his new friend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly face the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> In contrast to De Palma's underrated thriller is "Doppelganger" for the most part, this is a mediocre film that not only never fulfills its purpose, but also leads to one of the worst ends of film history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she can maintain her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast ranges from mediocre to painfully poor, though Leslie Hope is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and De Palmas influence is pretty obvious. While the film tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are boring and playing wood definitely does nothing. It has a fair share of nudity and strange reasons, as well as the excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects are created by the outstanding KNB effect and are among the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre overuse of the effects in a totally out-of-the-way ending reduces the impact of KNB's work and makes it cheesy, which would be amazing in another movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a B-movie is no excuse for the low quality, because with a better and more coherent script this could have been an interesting movie. Unfortunately, here we have only a mediocre film, which gets worse by the second. Worthy of Barrymore's beauty. 3.10
