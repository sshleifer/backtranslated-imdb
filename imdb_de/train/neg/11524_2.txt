Pretty incoherent film about a man who belonged to and left behind a superficially religious hippie cult of the 1960s, who fights against them 16 years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists who is being hijacked by the police during a police raid and taken prisoner by another man named Hawk who lives in a small hut by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some people in the city. It's hard to keep track of who the characters are or what time frame the scenes should take. The leader is released sixteen years later (I got that out of the box - I missed the time in the movie). No one is made to look older, not noticeable anyway. <br /> <br /> One murder is done with a big circular saw, others with knives or a crossbow. I've never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who exaggerates, honks and roars the most. <br /> <br /> to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is beaten and we hear the sound of a whip. A woman fires a gun, and we do not hear her, but a rebound! It does not seem to have been made for comedy reasons.
