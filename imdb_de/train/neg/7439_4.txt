Another look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films are interesting. From an American point of view, this film was not so good. The protagonist, Marie, played by Anastasia Hille, was not a pleasant character, and I found it difficult to identify with her. She was uncomfortable and confused most of the time. In addition, too much time was spent to bring them to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before a real tension built up. After that, the volume seemed to be the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they did not use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all, I would recommend it for rent, but not for theatergoers.
