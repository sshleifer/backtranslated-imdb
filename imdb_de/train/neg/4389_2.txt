If you like casual nudity with high school baton comedy then look no further. <br /> <br /> About halfway the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle begins to hide at every opportunity. That's the only thing that makes this movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is both lame and absurd, the humor is cheesy and the character development is basically nonexistent.
