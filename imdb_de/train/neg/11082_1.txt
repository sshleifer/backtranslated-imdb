I know it's a Power Rangers gimmick focused on 7-year-olds, but why did you take this movie seriously? When they write a plot with crayons, at least they have the decency to make them stupid. It's kind of funny when you see that. We have a typical family with clich√©d characters (Father, a war veteran who has lost his wife and accuses himself of LOLOL), air-kid children who are trying to fill the stereotype, but fail with terrible drama and a ridiculously gruesome buddy who does not Purpose is to fill the movie but the camera room. Funny stuff! <br /> <br /> However, the really great moment comes to an end when war dad and evil villain try to make a sword fight, but then they realize that none of them (probably there's no room in the budget for choreographers) So they come with this American gladiator attitude in which they walk around. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they are trying to treat this seriously.
