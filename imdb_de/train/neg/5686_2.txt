Hello. This is my first review for every movie I've seen. I took the trouble to do so, to tell everyone that this is literally the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I feel that the movie has been done very well, which I will be understanding due to the budget constraints in creating it. I felt like I saw a very bad remake of the movie saw. What I agree with looked very graphic, but I liked the movie saw. <br /> <br /> The scene where he leads the hammer to the head of the bound victim on the chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. The scene almost always lasted, well, it probably was about 5 minutes, but still. I would like to say that I like some horror movies and I give credit if they are good. This director Uwe Boll and his group who shot this movie should think about it before making another movie similar to this movie. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO WILL BE OBSERVED ANIMALS, DEATH, RED, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF A SOMEONE ISOLATED WITH A HAMMER, enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a movie higher budget, such as saw. I can not believe that people actually make such films. I'm sorry for anyone who loves uwe boll and takes it to heart, that's just my opinion of the movie.
