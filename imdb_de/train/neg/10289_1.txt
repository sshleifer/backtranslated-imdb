This should really earn an "O" rating or even a negative ten. I have seen this show for ages, and the series jumped with the shark for the series 7. However, this episode is proof that the show jumped the shark. It's lazy, absurd, selfish and not even garbage like Beavis and Butthead. Count of Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. It's as ridiculous as "This is the worst thing I've ever seen". And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible and that comes from someone with a stargate in their basement. <br /> <br /> Lets me sell my Stargate props the most.
