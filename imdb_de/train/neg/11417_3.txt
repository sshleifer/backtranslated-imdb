The teenage group in St. Elmo's Fire, who have just graduated from college, seems unlikely to be able to go through high school in less than four years at a prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to hold them up as a touchstone for a generation. With a now outdated cast of "Up and Comers," a background score that sounds very similar to "Terms Of Endearment," and with which you write the complacency of this circle over us, "Fire" is a paltry outburst that will grow over the years even more embarrassing. * 1/2 of ****
