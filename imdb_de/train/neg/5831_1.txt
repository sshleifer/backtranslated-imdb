This movie is extremely boring and overbearing. There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr. Barney's eyebrow (think of the appearance of purple without a dinosaur). The music is relentlessly reassuring - it is sad that Bj√∂rk, a person with so much inner beauty, was brought to an arrogant falsehood in her art. The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual disappear. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are canceled. Not just from Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (Stay tuned) In a perfect moment, "Art imitates life", the crew of the ship finds a huge piece of shit. Which is what the audience found in the theater. There are a few sets that are very composed and artfully without a heart. Then prepare yourself for spoilers. I'm talking to you, Mr. Barney. The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you have gone out! I have seen Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And your thin, false veil from BS was lifted. You stole your husband's pictures and your entire art catalog from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released, we can finally hope that the forces on the Art Councils of the world will stop funding you! Poor Jodorowsky lost in a financial fight with the Beatles Lawyer when he is the Lennon / McCartney of filmmaking. And by the way, while Jodorowsky is the Beatle - YOU ARE THE APES! A cheap, thin, soulless rip-off that was popular only by simple cheesy college newcomers. And by the way, I'm a filmmaker. If you're interested in making a reality movie, I'll rightfully fight you in a ring defending Jodorowsky.
