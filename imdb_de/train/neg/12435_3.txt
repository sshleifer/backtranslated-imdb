Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film of the Home-Alone-Empire. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip for a missile guidance system and smuggle it through an airport in a remote-controlled toy car. The grumpy woman Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car because of luggage confusion. She gives it to her neighbor Alex (Linz), just before the spies arrive. The spies rent a house to break down every house in the neighborhood until they find the car. With the chickenpox at home alone, Alex calls 911 when he detects a theft, but the spies always manage to escape the police while Alex is accused of pranking. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, unaware that he has manipulated devices to skilfully fill his entire home. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably should not have been done, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some fun parts, but I do not like it when changing characters in a movie series, at your own risk.
