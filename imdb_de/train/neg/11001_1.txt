I've never seen a comedy that was so annoying to sit by nothing. Okay, maybe a little giggle for the Michael Clarke Duncan as the tall, black, bald-headed gay maiden. But the rest was terribly uncomfortable. Apart from the fact that there are no laughter, the "skits" go on forever! Avoid them if you value your time and money. DREADFUL !!! The worst!!!
