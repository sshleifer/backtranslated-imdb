I commented this on the first debut and gave him a "thumbs-up" report, noting that I would use the doubt more than just the first episode. I have seen six episodes so far in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: This show is absolutely crap. <br /> <br /> Everything is not right. Everything. If you just get past the lousy animation and the design, the stories are ridiculously devoured and without any character development or obvious interest from the authors of this muck to give any stories any substance. .Is it just me, or is the joker in EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham such a revolving door legal system? Or is it just a total lack of interest in the authors to seek out other villains (see above "no character development"). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every single Joker story is the same 3-piece formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker is good for people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets about firing the whole city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode I saw that was not a joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was this nefarious Cluemaster ... the episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the quiz show. It was the simplest Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I think about this show because she's probably against the ToS, but she starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization." Thank God for the existence of the Timm / Dini / etc. era of Bat Entertainment, back from the WB days of Fox and Kids. So good, and I should have known that unfortunately could not last forever.
