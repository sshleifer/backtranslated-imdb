Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a lousy crap. I am surprised that it was rated so high. What's up with this movie? Here's a better question: what's wrong with this movie? <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©. Here's pretty much what it's all about ... A somehow nerdy kidless boy is hunted down, killed, and comes back as a scarecrow to avenge himself. "Everything" is packed in 86 minutes worthless movie. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time looking at it. The second movie is not much better either, so do not mind ... I rated this movie with three, because I liked the outfit of the scarecrow, not because the movie was a good one. I think you get the picture.
