I've just seen this movie tonight and have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he is more annoying than this and the movie is more than a remake of the 80s classic "Santa Claus the Movie", but without the camp or the evil Sheena Easton song at the end. The story is your run of black mill sheep in the family returning to the holidays to deal with his family, however, with the North Pole as a backdrop. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family that comes home after a series of setbacks, including his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a role as a cameo), and brings him home, so he comes home to take care of himself To face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and crazy High Jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarchy threatening Christmas. If you now think you know the end of this movie, I would be right, because it is predictable for the hill. In terms of acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same loveable loser he always plays, but this time he's more annoying than sympathetic. Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than a grade, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but she's not a character apart from a neurotic joke, and poor Kevin Spacey basically plays the same person he's in The only two actors who come out of the film with intact dignity are Paul Giamatti, who really gives sincerity and warmth to his role as Santa Claus, but it seems a bit embarrassing to be in the movie, and you can not blame him and Rachel Weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most leading actors do with theirs, which is a great pity both because Rachel Weisz as well Paul Giamatti had earned much better than what this script gave them. <br /> <br /> To put it succinctly, a big disappointment.
