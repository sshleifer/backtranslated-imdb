* May contain spoiler * <br /> <br /> I lean back to be fair to the movie. I knew that Madonna was playing it. I knew that it took a whole week in the cinemas. I knew that it got a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful study of education, culture and sexuality, as we have received in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted ten full minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, witty Gorgon who goes on vacation with her husband and her funky friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna (some really stupid facial expressions) Adriano Giannini plays the first comrades of the ship the Madonna figure enjoys when humiliated and treated like dirt in every scene they have in common, why is she such a slut for him? Simply because the act requires it so that the tables will be turned over when the two later neuter on a lonely Mediterranean island, and he will teach her a lesson, just as inexplicable is how they fall in love even though they have nothing in common and have abused two-thirds of the movie. > <br /> "Swept Away" is a stupid, simple, superficial film from the beginning to the end Madonna gives a typical wooden performance There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and rages on the demand G ianninis, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where he beats her and kicking her ass. Guy Ritchie makes his "stylish" editing, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a big movie in years. The end is sad and implausible. It's basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard," apart from the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Madonna's ego is so great that she insists on continuing to prove herself competent actress Please give it up, Madge, for us as well as for you. However, this is not her worst movie. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She has not done anything worse ... yet.
