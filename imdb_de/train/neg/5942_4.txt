If this is the black experience, leave me out either at the front or back door. <br /> <br /> A mother's boy will one day see two young toques, and from then on it will only be downhill. Angela Bassett, the only grace in this movie, plays his cocky, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has turned in the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept it. She allows his friends to come in, and suddenly it's okay to use obscenity unless she's in front of the kids. <br /> <br /> This is a sad thing about gangster rap. They knew where this movie should go. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed loudly as Bassett finally escorted her son's body to the funeral. She says that his life at the age of 24 He had become a man. Which man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most ferocious rap music with constant meanness and despised the company. This classroom scene, in which he tells a teacher that as a plumber, he will earn more than the teacher, is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. The complete and complete lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The rivalry between West Coast and West Coast is never fully understood. All we see are flaming weapons. <br /> <br /> A horrible picture that does nothing to prevent violence against gangs. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their disgusting music. The African American community should be ashamed of itself. Who was this classless fat bitch who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show thin in comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that turned that chubby little boy into the vulgar monster he was. What a sad situation, if this is called moving picture entertainment.
