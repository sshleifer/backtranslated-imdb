This movie is so bad that I can not believe it was actually shot. People who have voted 10 or 9, 8 or even 7, are you crazy? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same should I say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) Going nowhere, completely incoherent, acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), the music (what is that?), The editing and especially the artistic direction a pure disaster. Reminds me of the old Macist films ... To give you an example of the amateurism of staging, the mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with embroidered sequins. I'm not kidding, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the enormous mistakes we find here: You see in one scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds talking about her cellphone. At the next shot, which is in a completely different location, you can see the same woman who is still talking on her cell phone (!). Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, huge waste of money. Useless.
