The cast is fine. The script is sometimes awkward and it takes a while to figure out what the movie is about. I was looking forward to the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement about the war. I think we should not remember ... we did it. It's a house, you only killed forty-five minutes. The shower part ... huh? What was it about? Literally it says I have a customer: "Okay, you can use our shower." Yawning. The angles are trying too hard. There were a number of forests, suddenly it disappeared, because you can see right through, then it is deep and animals die. In the end, this is a horrible movie with boring proportions.
