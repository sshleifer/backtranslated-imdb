There were some scary scenes that I've always liked more than happy, but otherwise this movie was rather weak. There were too many unanswered questions, and when they tried to explain anything in the movie, it was still pretty unclear. After watching this movie, I seemed to be lost in many ways. It somehow reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This movie was also unsatisfactory, but still better than that, because it tried to work and the story actually made sense. This is not so much. <br /> <br /> Abandoned acting was pretty decent for the most part, but the movie went on and never really brought any satisfying conclusions. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
