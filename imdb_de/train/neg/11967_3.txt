Given the risk of having same-sex relationships before the late 1980s, Personal Best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase in Cahill's life. <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have thrown the same-sex relationship between two pretty attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds when the steps of several women jumping backwards over a high jump bar. This random scene had a very low relevance to the movie and it seemed like it was only done to interest the audience in this bland movie. I suspect the producers were trying to counteract the boring conspiracy and even more boring scenery of the film (the Oregon Track and Field Competition of 1980). <br /> <br /> This review may be tough, but it is true. The exploitation of the body of young Muriel Hemingway and the same-sex relationship ruined any appreciation that I would have given to this film. Pepper Thompson
