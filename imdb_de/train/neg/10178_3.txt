How did I ever appreciate this dudel of a sequel? All it does is throw balls! The worst part is that it is not comparable to the first part of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Sufficient slapstick action in the field takes too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this book from a complete nine-inning stoppage. What's next, Major League 4: Return to the Little League? Uh, could be! Leave this on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one had three strokes too many.
