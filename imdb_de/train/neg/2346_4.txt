For the first time I have not seen this movie in the "Essentials" series of TCM for too long. The eye of the viewer's clich√© was never appropriate. This viewer saw little value in this. I was confused about the infinite magnetism that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie her character is more of a mouse than an attractive one. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would rather ignore Lucy than fall into an instant of falling in love with her. In the defense of Bacall, this film was filmed at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and the weight of his deteriorating health could have affected her performance. Of course, part of Lucy's fatigue was to confront her with sloppy Marylee, who played Dorothy Malone to the limit and beyond. The scene in which she performs a wild-sensual dance while her father tiredly climbs the stairs to a deadly heart attack is by far the best scene in the movie. Malone's performance outshines the rest, though Jasper Hadley's fatigue about the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, though, I have to say that I'm not a big fan of melodrama. The cartoon-like behavior of the characters makes a story too implausible for my taste.
