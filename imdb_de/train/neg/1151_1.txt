This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, the main character, is anything but "motherly". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband dies. Then she goes to her son and meets this guy who sleeps with her daughter and sleeps with him. Up to this part, the movie is fine. Not excellent, but it can be observed. The guy is charming and who can blame her? OK, it's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's lover, but let's blame her for the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She is totally obsessed with the guy. I think that's the part where I started not liking the movie. She's always there to "snack" on him in an "old-fashioned way" while working in her son's house (I think that's the only thing she's ever learned) as if it was the only way she could get attention. The guy is obviously not very interested (actually, it seems more like he's sleeping with her for a charity activity) and instead of being offended, she keeps asking him to go to bed with her and be nice to her when he becomes very abusive. "I like you," she says desperately, while insulting her. <br /> <br /> What has outraged me in this film is the total lack of self-esteem the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless lump" when they first sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to women. If it had been me, I would have bought a small object that would have given me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
