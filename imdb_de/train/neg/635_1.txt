Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role was not required. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the movie. Luise's character was a slave who was then married to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Both actors were not Asian in ancient Asia, but convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because Luise must have got her Oscar. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to have a methodacte. This seems to be something that Hollywood often does. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I found Luise's performance consistently dull, and when she died she did not change from earlier scenes. She stayed the same throughout the movie. She may only change her expression or her emotions twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I probably did not see it.
