This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made. He had everything to make a movie great. Incredible spectacle, great special effects ...... oh, I have to think of a good movie. Well, that was not one of them, it was just shit. <br /> <br /> What I would like to know is what a bone head this movie would hold for a 10. When I cast my vote, there was 206 out there, God knows what's going on in her head. As with any other vote, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie sooo good to give it a 10? I know these are the same ones, of which Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
