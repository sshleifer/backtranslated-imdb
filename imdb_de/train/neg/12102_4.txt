This movie is really just Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are some fun moments and some interesting points, but do not go into it if you expect an equal discussion about religion. This is what I consider the worst kind of documentary film - everything is arranged in advance and in the editorial office to give you the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decision. <br /> <br /> - It's very small cut and it's associated with pop culture and media clips to reinforce the point. The interviewee hardly has a chance to finish a sentence before it is interrupted by the processing. The only people who are given a fair chance to voice their opinion are those who say what Bill Maher demands of them. As soon as someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, he is processed. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWEES - They are supposed to be the most extreme religions. From the evangelical television to the ultimate Jewish cliché to the TRUCK STOP chapel (seriously: a TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He has chosen the worst cash grabs, the heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say no. And if he brings a good person to a job interview, he's got hell out of it. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are represented as clichés. Especially affected are the Muslims. During the Muslim section, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before either interrupting him or working with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as extreme extremists by editing, and none of the interviewees are treated fairly. <br /> <br /> ENDING - The message at the end is AMAZING, and it's interesting idea, it does not do justice to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while destruction videos are in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and will destroy the world. He also explains that anyone who has anything to do with religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the mistakes of the film, he has some good points, and the humor, though it is very unfair, is actually funny. But you know, it's a very one-sided view of the religion of Bill Maher. He does not discover anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - A few good moments, but with an irresponsible style of documentation.
