For the first 20 minutes or so (I've seen it on a PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took) Alienator has an interesting requirement. I do not think I've ever seen a Slasher movie with an alien from another planet as a villain. However, the interest soon turns into baffled doubts when you realize that the alien is a huge bodybuilder woman in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Do not think that's what I'm up against. In the world of Shock horror, obviously ridiculous behavior can often be a good sign. The blatant stupidity of his premise, however, is all that the film has to offer. Alienator is funny as hell, but it's also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. Actors fail due to failed attempts at seriousness, potentially ingenious lines of pure cheese dialogue stumble with disconcerting incompetence, and the direction does not even bring one or two decent sets together. When the movie is done, you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripple the team has piled on top of it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the "alien" only kills people by vaporizing them, in contrast to not being called "slashing", and you have a huge bunch of good ideas can rot. You'll laugh about Alienator, but AT, not with it. If that's your thing, then just do it.
