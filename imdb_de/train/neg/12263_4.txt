Watching this film, as I just made it for the first time at Turner Classic (which lists it as a "Dangerous Female"), can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must have been paid by the grin. I hope he remembered his dentist and brylcreem salesman in his will. They made him the actor he was. The women are all good, but no better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little bit better. More interesting are the "Original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who provide many of the individual tics competently, but almost nothing of the atmospheric atmospheres of their successors in the roles of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor have outdone the reminiscence of their characters; Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not stink right now; it lies there like a big piece of ham. Their main value today is a reminder that great films like the '41 Falcon do not just happen. On the scale of 1 to 10, I rate it as 4, mainly for the camera work and the supporting players.
