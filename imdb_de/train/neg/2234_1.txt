I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I know why. The drama was the worst thing I've seen in a long time. The lighting and the sound are bad at best. The plot also makes little sense when you are sober (ATTENTION: I do not suggest watching this movie soberly.) This movie feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who does not get much out. It's really a shame that all the very little money spent on this project led to such a waste. I'm looking forward to seeing if any of the admirers still have a career apart from Eva Longoria, who is the only "star" of this movie that did not seem to be hit with the bad-looking stick. I am sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill. Do not try again. In the words of Squirlyem "There is a lack of good department".
