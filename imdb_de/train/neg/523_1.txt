It is amazing to me what is considered entertainment today. Maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties and I have no contact with today's generation of film production, and apparently this is the case with this film because so many people loved it. I thought it was mean and vulgar. I have not said that about many movies in my life, but this one is just right. The humor is sophomoric and raw. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes not only not funny, but downright offensive (I'm not gay). The main character of the film is not even a sympathetic person, just pathetic. When the movie finally came to an end, I heard a number of people commenting on how disappointed they were with what they had just paid to see good money.
