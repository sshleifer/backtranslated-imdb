Did this yesterday at the IFC and can not believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? Kate tells Jed that she could be fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but she's on her way! Then they suddenly decide that they are in love? And she is so devastated by his death, she does not go to his funeral, much less tell her "good news" to her family! By the way, how did an American become the principal of a very good British school? Janine should have been thrown out of power for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up with a con that brought her to interrogation! And the less that is said about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for guilt, Janine and Molly feel about Jed please! It's the punk's damn fault that he was turned into roadkill! Where is the blame for poor Gerald getting spanked? If only I could do the same with the clues behind this "movie"!
