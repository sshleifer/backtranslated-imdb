Joel Schumaker, who directs the script he co-wrote, has a group of Georgetown graduates who are confronted with adult life situations. The plot is a jumbled mess, but some scenes are really good. Here a lot of talent and time is wasted. The cast is more impressive than the movie. On show are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty disgusting. Growing up is not so easy.
