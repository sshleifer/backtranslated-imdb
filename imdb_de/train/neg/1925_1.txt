Ron Howard directed that? The 1966 cartoon is charming and offers children a simple lesson with a simple plot. In this film Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, selfish Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault. I imagine the script was called the worst person you can imagine, so Carrey Tom channeled it, and the result is film magic. Similar to Danny Devito's penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so utterly unlikely that any degree of comedy that might be gained from his character simply disappears. Where the 1966 caricature featured a Grinch we could all identify with, Carreys Grinch is the angry, soulless old man we've all seen once, sitting in a parked car, mumbling to themselves or toddlers in the car Supermarket stumbles his stick This Grinch is completely robbed of any degree of humanity, humor or any insight, and his redemption at the end of the film is wrong. The whole movie is wrong: there's a stupid Christmas contest, a failed attempt to explain why the Grinch is such a jerk when he dug into his childhood, and an incomprehensible secret about why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them are not. In contrast to the cartoon of 1966, I would imagine that children would find this film tiresome, irritating and full of conflicting messages. Do we really have to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski, as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw the necessary butts, fart jokes, sex jokes and other compulsory Carreyesque humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 caricature (or the book that inspired it) as George W. Bush comes rational, clear thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
