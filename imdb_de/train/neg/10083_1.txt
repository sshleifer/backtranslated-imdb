They changed the title of this cruelty into an unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains dialogues that would be laughed out of a third recital in third grade. At a point when the woman leaves the man, a bad cover from All by Myself plays the soundtrack! Seriously. The actors try but are struck by the inappropriate, incredibly awful writing. The direction is amazingly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How are such things done? I turn off the TV before it's over!
