A romanticized and thoroughly wrong idea of ​​the unemployment of a "middle-class artist" with a comfortable education ... It is clear that the director has never suffered directly from unemployment and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live through pranks, jokes all day long. They never look for work, they almost never experience rejection or fear, etc. Life on the work floor is like summer school holidays ... ridiculous. Especially if you compare it to contemporary masterpieces by Ken Loach and so on.
