I'm sure there is a kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of. Having seen both this and "werewolf" and read dozens of comments on how undervalued they are, I became convinced that there is some certainty here. Many people say that people who hate it are "just scared of Gore", "I do not know any good horror" or anything like that. Well, I'm not really interested in Gore, but I want something to happen in a movie! Most of it is just the woman who sits and looks around! Or walk around the house / garden! A movie requires something to give it atmosphere, you do not get it through pointless scenes in which someone walks around and stares. Oh, and "makes you think"? Yes, I thought "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I have ever staged! <br /> <br /> S. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, That kind of stuff.
