I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" are the main reason, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this worthless piece of rubbish. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future filmmakers. If you have a film that is as successful as the original Corpse Grinders, you should probably leave sleeping dogs behind, and in no case try to revive them more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial backing Even if you choose, you should probably spend a little more money than on the original and for God's sake ... NEVER do a movie filming on video ... Why do filmmakers even try to do that when everyone knows the quality will be disgusting? Personally, I've done it Watching a movie that's even worth the powder to blow it to hell ... If you can not afford to do a sequel that's better than your original one Movie, then you sell the rights of the movie to someone who can do this ... and what did Ted V Mikels think (or smoke) when he wrote this god-a wful script? I mean, come on, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A cardboard box that looks like a devastating machine that can grind human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If one of these actors, except Liz Renay, has been paid more than five dollars for his vile performances, they are completely overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and see the original instead.
