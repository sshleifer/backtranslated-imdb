I was fortunate to have read the book before watching the movie. It was an epic of adolescence, a summer's dream, a great potential indie movie, or a big budget drama. It somehow fell into the hands of a hack that clearly took notes while watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without even learning anything. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low gag. I'm sorry for the actors because the characters in the book were rich and structured, but in the movie they were just embarrassing characters. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the skeleton left over from the story is a bad thing after a school special. Poor people = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it's almost worth seeing the southern California beach where Gary Sinise parked his trailer to fit a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing turn for director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
