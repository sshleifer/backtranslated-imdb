I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I loved her on Top Model and was really happy when she won. I also like Chris Knight, he seems to be a great guy. But this show just made me sick! I'm so mad at both what happened on this show. I do not care that it was another age, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. It did not surprise me at all that he had not suggested. And I see no incentive to force someone to marry you before he is ready. If it should be, then why not simply enjoy each other's company and love each other and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary. It is stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, too bad for you, that you broke down and still made her a suggestion! You have two failed marriages behind you, how could you fall into another just because she had a seizure? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage has been canceled for all the wrong reasons. Maybe they can now take a breath and find the right reasons to get married from the marriage.
