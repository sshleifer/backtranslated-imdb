Even as I watched this movie with a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora was playing a movie about an artist sleeping on the way up. As beautiful and sexy as Ms. Zadora is, she could not stop this sad apology of a movie from refueling. Not even her photo shoot for Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" was already promoted "by the day", could stop this movie from refueling. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Miss this one.
