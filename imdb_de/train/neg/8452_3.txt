This is the first time I've commented on a movie because I thought the right guy could wake up the movie and do something about it. In recent months, ABC Family began broadcasting a new format of films. I have seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were captivating and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I was looking forward to "See Jane Date". The trailers looked good and sounded good. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book must be light years ahead of the efforts of the authors and musicians involved in this project. The year 2003 is the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as a lift ride in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. It helped against that. I work in the film and television business. I enjoy being entertained. This is a case where I constantly thought it could get worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you would not know it from this movie. To complete the overall experience, the end shook my head. Advice to the executives of Disney, ABC, ABC Family, and the producers: Under no circumstances should you hire the composer or music tutor for future movies. They have lost touch and need to understand what the terms contemporary, modern and current mean when they describe a romantic comedy. There is a world that passes by you. All in all a big disappointment from the people of Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
