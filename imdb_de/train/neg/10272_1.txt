When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had to throw my mother into the stack of movies in the "4 for $ 20" section at Blockbuster. When we got home and plunged into the movie ... after twenty minutes, we turned to "that's shit. Let's put something else on." I admit, a few lines from the friends in the cafe left us a little smile. But come on, get at least decent actors! From time to time in a movie, when acting is bad and the movie is not embarrassingly slow and actually interesting, I can figure it out and make some laughs about how they are over (or under)) making their lines. But I can only take so much. Screaming scenes looked like the actors had hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines ... In this movie, amateur does not get used to acting. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here To say that this movie was good had to have had some really good drugs while watching the movie. It's the most meaningless thing I've ever seen. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM !!!!!
