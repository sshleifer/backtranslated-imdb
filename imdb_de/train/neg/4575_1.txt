I admit that I am currently only a student, an English major. By the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I would say it's a junior year, but it may have been older, hard to remember. My experience in quantum physics refers to my physics course with honors, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read the subject in a series of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as every article I can find and the same. I am by no means a PhD. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. It aims to address the scientific spirit of an average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe how special everyone is. My mother is such a person and since she saw this movie she's been trying to get all her friends to see him and bought a copy of the movie. I've tried to point out the various mistakes and problems I've seen in the movies of logic and science - and that's numerous - and she rejected my claims because "oh, a high school student knows more than anyone Doctoral students. "In this case, apparently. <br /> <br /> To leave behind the fact that the doctorate is not mandatory for a person to be correct or actually intelligent. I have left the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to expose half of the film. To make that clear, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to give the impression that they supported their beliefs when he was in fact completely against them. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think Intuitor did the movie really well. Feel free to read this if you are interested. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
