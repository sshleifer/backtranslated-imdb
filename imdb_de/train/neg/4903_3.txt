I'm never a big fan of Taiwan film production as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. Strong-looking quality is hard to find in them, as shown clearly in this film. I do not consider myself as hard to please as I am actually a fan of indie films. However, this film shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle, where the action goes. The drama certainly does not make it any better. Rainie's acting is unsurpassable because she seems "over the top" and tries to be cheeky and sweet. Although I have to admit it is a pleasure to look at her. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, deplorable and extremely reserved character. Overall, I find this movie a disappointment.
