Apart from the above-average acting skills of the two leads, this film is really very bad. The favorable production values ​​do not help. Of course, you would not really notice that the production values ​​are cheap if you did not constantly try to convince you that they initially had a production value. Even for a B-movie genre freak like me, this movie really shits.
