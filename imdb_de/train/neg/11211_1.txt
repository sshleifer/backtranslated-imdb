There is so much that is wrong with this film, but to summarize it: terrible action - it must have been so bad on purpose. bad script - they may have had some good ideas, but this was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad end - in some cases, the end to save the film - not in this case. If you manage to go through the whole movie, you want to kick yourself in the end, because the end is not even worth the wait. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It was perfect torture to go through this movie, I could have appreciated someone who warned me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then you will regret exposing yourself to indescribable torture.
