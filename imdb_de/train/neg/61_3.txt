There is not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which is the title of the alleged comedy Neil Simon's only ironic moment. Simon, who has adapted the script from his play (which is not in the credits), equates age with irrational behavior - and, worse, awkward, galumphing, mean irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless when we played an old variety-performer who was reunited with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special. , Burns, who has won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune to come to the film in about thirty minutes. Afterwards Matthau has already blown the material into hell and back. The louder the movie becomes, the less tolerable and observable it is. Director Herbert Ross did a solid job only if he was not affiliated with any of Neil Simon's scripts. This is where Ross Gags builds up like a dull amateurs and pounds off belligerent routines that do not pay off (like half-incoherent Matthau, who appears in a mechanic's workshop to audition before a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he compensated by rolling and roaring. It was up to Ross and Simon to defuse the character, to refine his temperament to give "The Sunshine Boys" some sunshine, but Walter keeps projecting as if we were all deaf. The picture looks terribly dark and crawls along at a mindless pace; you lose hope for it early. * 1/2 of ****
