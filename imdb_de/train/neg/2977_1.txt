Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei. Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To check out this movie and get some good backgrounds, I have to start at the beginning. And the beginning of it is really George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in the year 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect successor and call it Zombie 2. This movie is the one we know as a pure old zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK, so after this movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy), which came out and made a huge amount of money, the Italians decided, heck. Let's do more zombie flicks! These things rake in the dough! That's how Zombie 3 was born. Still confused? The story of this movie is really just a summary of the stories we've seen in many American zombie flicks we saw before this movie. The best comparison I can think of is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... there is the government that experiments with a particular poisonous gas that turns people into zombies. Canister is released into the general population and Shebang! We get a lot of zombies craving human flesh. A few people run away from the zombies and land in an old, abandoned hotel. You have to fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of Italy, was sick. So he could not finish this movie as he wanted. The film was then passed on to the two smaller directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the living dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a movie that was not that good. You see, Fulci herself did not really have heart and soul in this movie. He was not enthusiastic about it. He gave the movie to the producers and basically said, "Do whatever you want!" And God loves them, they did it. <br /> <br /> And that's why ladies and gentlemen have such a shitty zombie movie with the big fulci called a "director." The main problem in my opinion is that it's just a pointless hole! There is no substance at all! After the first few minutes that some terrorists steal and accidentally release the poisonous gas, the rest of the strip consists only of empty, soulless characters who do not draw any personality from the zombies. In some cases this can be funny if # 1's zombie makeup and zombie action are really good and funny and # 2 is involved in gore and guts. <br /> <br /> Here we do not get any! Well, there are some inspirational moments, for example, when some eagles are infected by the gas and attack people. That was cool. There is also a scene with a flying zombie head (which, by the way, contradicts all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and chewing the legs of a poor girl. But other than that ... the rest of the strip just falls on the ass. <br /> <br /> Endless scenes in which the action, which does not exist anyway, is not moved. That was my main complaint with this movie. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is virtually nonexistent. I hate it when everything looks so damned unfinished! I like my B-Movies, but this one really fell under it! It's closer to a Z-level movie, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The zombie make-up? Pure crap. The zombies are all about Asian actors (the movie was shot in the Philippines), so you get a bunch of Asian zombies. But that's not a big deal, since the movie is set in the Philippines anyway. It's the look of the zombies that really shit! For some reason, they died with the same clothes. And what zombie makeup is all about is a bunch of black make-up (more like spots) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex make-up, but it was still not good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of goo being splashed senseless on the faces of the actors. This strip is not only slow, but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead people! For those who expect the usual coolness in a Fulci movie, you should not expect this here, as this is usually the movie of another. And the two participants (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put their heart and soul into it. When you see the extras on the DVD, you'll find that Fragasso, when asked about his memories and feelings about this film, does not take it seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of that, and he often says that they "just had a job and they did it". And that, my friends, is the last nail in this movie. There is no love and no heart to make this movie. That's why you get a half assed, crappy zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Only for those who have or want to see a zombie movie. Everyone else, do not even bother about it! Rating: 1 out of 5
