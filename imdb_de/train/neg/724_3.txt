The concept for Sarafina seems to be solid, apart from the musical perspective. She tries to combine African music with a story that describes the cruel conditions and atmosphere black people had to endure at the time the movie was filmed. The contradictions of the two elements are too blatant and the film never justifies such rapid changes between jubilation and terror. If it had simply been a drama that reflected these conditions, it might have been a good movie, but the scenes of schoolchildren being shot down by soldiers are not right next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Apart from the bad premise, acting is not the best, but Goldberg does a mediocre performance, as does the rest of the cast. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
