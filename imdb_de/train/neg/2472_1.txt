Anyone who has actually been able to get through this movie and feel like a good movie does not appreciate the quality of films. This film was an insult that could be seen, the direction was the quality of the class and the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had a better camera and I hate this step with passion! The plot had the potential to be a very intense, very good movie, but fell flat from the first 10 minutes to the end of the movie. Someone mentioned that this movie was about a child's fantasy, okay, that's all well and good. But with this script, they could have done even better things than what they did. Come on, the Indian in the shop. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they say to the store clerk and she casually says that no one else works here except me, so you're okay, a weird ghost scenario, but then she just swaps for the amount on the idol and we forget the kid sees that guy , That was so lame that it is miserable. In the end, you're not just wondering what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell did I waste my time seeing this !! This is a move I should NOT recommend, as there are definitely better movies that will not offend your intelligence! Thankfully, I never had to pay to see this movie. I would have reclaimed my money! For those who were easily entertained by this movie ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of filming, to really say that it was a good movie.
