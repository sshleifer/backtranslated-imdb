The film and the acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job with Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that he is a precursor to a hit movie. Obviously, the creators of this prequel did not observe the original Carlito Way, or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel, which means the original movie has already set some story for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least leads. None of Carlito's close old friends from the original appear in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, originally Pachanga, is in the film, but plays a very different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel 1969-70. Considering that this movie is less than five years ago, would not you believe that one of Carlito's longtime friends would show up? In the original, Carlito is released from prison after 5 years in prison. These are only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning that Carlito spent five years in prison. So when the prequel brings this Hollywood happy ending, it's an insult to the intelligence of the fans of the original. What happened to Gail? It is the lack of continuity that brought this film directly to the release of videos.
