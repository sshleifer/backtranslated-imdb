Disappointing action movie with an interesting premise: A young mafia killer (Chandler) has to prove to his boss that he is a good man for the service. Beluschi). First and Most Important Task: Killing a young woman (Lee) is a strange thing for everyone. But is she an easy target? The film continues based on this basic idea, but the result is just a bad routine. Even the strange twist at the end does not save the movie. Good performance from Chandler. I give a 4 (four).
