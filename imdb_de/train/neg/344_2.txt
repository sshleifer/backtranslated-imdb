Let me really clarify this movie. I did not see this movie because of the storyline, I look at it for the naughty sex scenes. However, this film is so damned awful that between pure joy, I see a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer), and the horror of my eyes for the catastrophe of a conspiracy seems to turn back and forth In the first scene of the film I had already a lamentation. You see a woman painting something on the lake shore, in sheer bliss and serenity, then approaching a beautiful girl and asking if she could paint next to her. When both were done, they showed what they had done ... and the woman painted a vineyard when she is in the sea. What kind of screwball director would make that mistake? And in another scene, Traci can kill her teacher's lover by shattering him with the sail pole, and then she floats away, and nobody in the city's police once suspected her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY WAS NO GLOVE, DO YOU HAVE YOU? YOUR FINGER PRINT IS ALL ABOUT GOD DAMN BOAT !! After that, when Mandy is near, the "chilling" sound effect that sounds like a cat hissing is played. It is also a pity that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I'm really sorry that she does not have to play a role in this super-low-budget soft-porn. The same applies to JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the bad luck to participate in this film. All in all, 2/10.
