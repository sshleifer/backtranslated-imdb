Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nothingness. I'm not familiar with the director's work and I know the filmmaker he allegedly pays tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro. Although she has not even addressed Ozu in her size, Hou has not said anything about the depth of Ozu's emotion and concentration on meaning in a confined space. What he totally misses is Ozu's attention to the character - we are not even "introduced" by Hou into his main character (a perfect blank page). There are no middle or close attitudes of his people. One of the DVD extras features interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Hou does not do - take a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish movie by Bardem, called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates into something like "Nothing Ever Happens". That would be a much better title for this pointless exercise. Throughout the film we get hints of an obscure Taiwanese composer, some of whom are on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, do nothing. If you are not a Trainspotter, this movie has nothing to recommend.
