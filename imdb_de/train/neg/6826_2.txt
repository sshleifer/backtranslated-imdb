It's been a long time since I last saw such a bad movie. The acting is very average, the story is terribly boring and I have no idea what the execution is. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and that's as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) did it right - 80% of the cast consisted of forgotten actors. If you were hoping for a career relaunch, I think that will never happen on your CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and clearly should remain an actor) made it. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than everyone else. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever think about it, you should check it out - I strongly recommend that you turn to something less traumatic, because not only is it a total loss of time, but also a faint one Example of how bad cinema looks like.
