This could be one of the worse movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how it could ever be described as a horror movie or even as a thriller. It's more like a lumbering drama. The creepy music is EXCELLENT, but with no frightening situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use them for everyday activities like dropping a garbage dump or climbing stairs. The movie had so much potential. They had beautiful cinematography (sp?) And interesting characters, but it seemed like the authors would assume that you already knew them. They would follow special activities without explanation or even a hint of what they meant. This is just one of those movies that say it's about one thing and something completely different.
