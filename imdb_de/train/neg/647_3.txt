The drama was as revolting as the script. It was poorly arranged and almost made you laugh at the murderous murder scenes. The end was even worse. Everyone died, but somehow it looked like everything was fine! They did not give enough story about the obsession of the teacher, etc. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really put this movie in order, but the script and acting failed miserably.
