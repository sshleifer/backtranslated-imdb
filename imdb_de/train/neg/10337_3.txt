Man the end of this movie is so terribly unsurpassed and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the movie was okay. There were a few unintentionally funny scenes, but had some really good camera shots and editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who has done FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane. The problem is not the direction, the acting or anything technical. The film is destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters were all about NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell did the writer smoke when he invented that? The way out of nowhere could have been the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, the life of David Gale or Notorious, I think that this is the worst ending ever. What a disappointment.
