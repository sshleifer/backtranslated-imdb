This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than church". Maybe I do not get it well enough, and I thought it started pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER), Hermann Brown is sent to jail and Maria starts to work / sleep with her boss, it just started to tug, and I had problems staying awake Maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion in the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF THE SPOILER). In the end, I do not understand why others think it's so great because I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not see this movie out of my own free will, because I had to see it for a film lesson.
