The completely ridiculous "Period" movie is just a thin excuse for his detailed, vivid portrayal of the heroine's affair with "the beast," a monster that appears to appear every century to rape some women. That's pretty much what he's doing, and the depiction of the animal in the movie is really terrible; It's basically a tall man in a furry suit with a mask and a huge PVC hose for a tough hangover that sprays plenty of white fluid. For fans of counterfeit pet porn, I think that might be a real kick-off. However, I was amused by how horses had sex in public places.
