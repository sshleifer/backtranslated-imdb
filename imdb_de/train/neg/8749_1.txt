A horrible movie, as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the cameo of Scott McNealy, who honored one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that is virtually defined by its hatred of Microsoft. They were instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. Were they stupid enough to believe that this bad movie gives the fire extra fuel? <br /> <br /> There are no public reports on SUN's involvement, but the creators of this film know Scott McNealy clearly. An interesting puzzle.
