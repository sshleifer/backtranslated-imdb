The complaints are true, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too targeted for women. I'm fine with these nocturnal soaps, like Gray's Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting, even if you assume they will never end. If the idea, however, coincides with the daily soaps aiming to put only good-natured men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and trumps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it seems as if it is a general hospital ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That's what men wanted and they had it, so if women want that, then the idea that this is a high brow show (or something that men will see) is unrealistic.
