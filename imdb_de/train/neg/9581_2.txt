That's the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I've been there and never seen the city look so good. Beautiful river and city landscapes. <br /> <br /> This film is moving at such a pace that it hopes you will not notice the world's lack of relevance. People walk around shooting without consequences. For example, a shot is fired in the house of Rob Lowe - two cars are stolen, and yet the bulls appear much later in the movie. Rent-a-murder never looked so implausible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this film should end up with one of the countless stray bullets. Many of the actors in this movie are so much better. I check the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the writing strike, but unfortunately this was not the case. This movie is currently being shot on Universal's HD channel. If you do not want to drool over Lowe, there's no reason to look at him.
