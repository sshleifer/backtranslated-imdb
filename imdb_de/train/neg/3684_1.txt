They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I thought it was pretty funny (comedy ?, I do not think so). I laughed the whole movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and the plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but OK. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy". I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams. Whoa! She is a beauty and a good actress, but let's try to achieve a small goal, the story mm mm ... the direction mm mm ... it lacks a lot of good tension, in fact it is a really boring Movie, but there is a good thing, it is a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was like 10 minutes under the water !!!) <br /> <br /> I just do not know why this film is rated so high, and even lazier tomatoes higher, what's up with good, rational and objective criticism?
