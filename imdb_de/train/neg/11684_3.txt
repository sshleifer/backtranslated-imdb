This movie makes no sense at all, there are plotting holes large enough to drive through huge NYPD vehicles. The characters do not work in a plausible way. I'll put my comments in the chat board, but you save time and money, that's stupid. I can not stand it when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash-bang gear, using imaginative editing and cool music, and does not bother with having an action that is even at the simplest level. But it's nice to see that Denzel W. dominates the man, available in three flavors: Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg, and Capt. From Trapp. There's even a cute little kid with a video game that's nice.
