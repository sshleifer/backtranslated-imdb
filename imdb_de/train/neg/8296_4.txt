Basically, a dentist-couple team and their 3 daughters are unfaithful. The premise is interesting, the acting is good and the music, though sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The husband's dentist leaves his wife behind the stage in an opera house (she plays a subordinate role) and then goes back to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his fear of this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear of confronting his wife so he does not have to do anything about it. "I will not tell you the end, but let me say that the movie is nowhere to go and the end is like a spitting whimper." The motivations of the characters are missing: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent-looking, good dad The movie does not say it, with whom does she do that, do not expect any answers, why does he want to uphold the marriage in spite of everything, who knows, what is the purpose of all the children who throw up, where is this movie going? by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic relief) are completely wasted by this darn nonsense, who does not know whether it is an American beauty film or a family movie.A root canal is more interesting.
