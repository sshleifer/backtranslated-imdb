A terrible plot (ami in its worst form), senseless and self-confident "decadence," obvious shock tactics, and irregular acting make this film (rather like "Rancid Aluminum") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted British movie revival. The humor is weak at best, and the presumption of the whole establishment (including a kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, as contemporary) really starts to rub. <br /> <br /> Final summary - a half-baked attempt to be "nervous", which does no favor. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
