This is undoubtedly the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the rating, it's way too good. This abomination was not even worth a rating of 0/10, if that was the case. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no action <br /> <br /> - Worst action scenes, and there are not too many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do it all himself, including the Fight, speaking (a lot of synchronization) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and can not care less about this movie. Something that is quite obvious. <br /> <br /> Take all the other Seagal garbage DTV films, multiply them, multiply them by a thousand billion and all the bad you win. I can even describe 1% of this absolute manure festival.
