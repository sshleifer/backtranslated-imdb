It has to be the craziest TV show in the air. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talents from his younger brother. I hope that this show will be canceled and will never be spoken again, except for a negative use. Jim has to retire or something. Please let them out of the air. If I make a joke of this show here, I'll throw up and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I'd rather be taken by the devil myself than to watch half an hour of this piece. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know that when we see Jim's face, we want to shoot our TV pictures. In the end, please no more.
