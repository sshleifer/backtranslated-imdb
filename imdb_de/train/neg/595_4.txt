Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, that's all for this movie. <br /> <br /> No real action, no action. No sympathetic characters, well, characters are not correct if you do not know who someone really is. I mean, they're being chased by a weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing, why is he there?), That's pretty scary, I think, but do I really care? No, I do not. Why me not Because I have no idea who these people are, and I do not know if I want them to live or die. It's one-dimensional and relies on gore and sound effects to scare you, which is rarely the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, no purpose. It feels like I fell asleep and missed the 45 minutes of building. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and their friends are locked up in the London Underground, chased by a strange creature, and finally flee. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, The location is excellent and the sounds are fine, but that does not make a decent horror movie, so unfortunately everything is thrown away. <br /> <br /> It is nothing new. Another predictable modern "horror" where Kate (the main character) is consistently stupid "Hey, I know you're sitting at home, thinking I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oh no, the total opposite I wish they would not do that, it's done so often, it's boring and predictable, in fact I'm pretty upset that the stupid woman is not from the earthly, gray alien creature <br /> <br /> "Your Journey Ends Here" is the movie's tagline Well, Creep's journey ends in the movie for a short time, so if you've had a couple of beers, you've got some buddies with you , then look at it, but if you want something original and clever, avoid it.
