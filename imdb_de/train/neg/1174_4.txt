Eric Rohmer's "The Lady and the Duke" is based on the magazines of an English aristocrat who lived through the French Revolution. But it's a darned affair, with strange, painted backgrounds and skilful conversation. This portrait of the age of terror almost always takes place at a distance from the real action; One sees in this film very few ordinary people and little chaos, poverty and terror, which took place in the salon rooms of the persecuted, but spoiled aristocratic classes. The result is often boring and ultimately not revealing about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; It is a disappointing film by a renowned director.
