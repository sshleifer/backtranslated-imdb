Absolutely horrible Mexican film allegedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, about a journalist who wants to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the forest to write a story about how it works, etc. When our hero is Gaston Faced the big show of dr. Maillard, head of asylum, we see all sorts of things that are horrible, like men hanging in a dungeon for a long time, and comedic, like our hero, joking on the soldier he climbs down a ladder that hangs over a building. Then there is a sight that could have been both: a human man dressed like a chicken, yes, that's really a chicken pecking for chicken feed on the floor. The scene was supposed to be a comedic highlight of the movie, but for me at least it was the low point of the movie and really disgusting, considering that adult men and women thought it might even be entertaining. Ah! That's the real horror that Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes is. And that brings me to this salient fact about the film, where most movies that go through multiple title changes usually have a serious problem. Yes, that's obvious, but some have distributional problems and others, one of which is one, have a lot of title changes, so someone unwittingly buys the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. It has very little to offer. The only performer worth a look is Claudio Brook as Asylum Leader. He is a giant ham plate, as he laughs madly, organ bellows, sash with sword in hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired to hear him talk about the "calming system" as a means of healing mental patients. What a bunch of ludicrosity (Hey, such a movie with a script like this deserves that word). It will not take you long to figure out what's going on in the asylum, and it will not be more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!
