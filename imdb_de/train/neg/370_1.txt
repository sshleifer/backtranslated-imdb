Blank Check is by far one of the worst movies of the nineties. The action is completely meaningless; His overtones of loneliness are pitiful. Do you really believe that a 12-year-old, personal assistant to a millionaire could achieve anything in this movie as if he were buying a mansion for only $ 300. The idea, not to mention the low price, will only be believed by the gullible spectators. Please respect your intelligence and do not look at this horrible, terrible movie.
