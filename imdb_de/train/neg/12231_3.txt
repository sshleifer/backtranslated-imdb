I saw this movie, and sometimes I was stunned to believe that this movie "saw me". Munchie sweetens the "farce" for years. Look at Star Wars again, do not look at Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a Responsible Parent (I speak with those who are now Parents), I would (you) not allow my (your) child Join this pseudo-occult video festival. Submitting Munchie is satanic, for a co-viewer it is likely that a "duh" is cooled. He is vicious, alien, spiky, and utterly malevolent-just as the bogey man makes flesh, invisible to adults, and seduces children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self-denial and prudent responsibility ). He is a trader of simple answers and false ideals. He is everything that the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil's own Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (literally and figuratively, with a focus on the former) that this film does not jump the format to DVD. I hope that this kind of "yellow filmmaking" on the cold nights of 1994 could suffer an unfortunate death. Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that. It comes up a lot.
