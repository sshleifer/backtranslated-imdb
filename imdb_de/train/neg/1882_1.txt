What a terrible piece of garbage !!! Who are all these people who appease how good that is? Yes, it is "arty"; and yes, it is "foreign", but .... that's not enough. The plot is boring and incoherent, like a reality show, but not so smooth. <br /> <br /> People are uninteresting in themselves; But as characters, they do not have enough depth to feel compassion for them. If they are based on real people, I am very sorry. <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems rather intrusive and free. It's as if the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think a lot of him too. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, if I had such neighbors, I would move!
