First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a capable actor, hardly a decent, sometimes just a lousy man. In this piece by SnakeEater @ *! ^ The film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnamese veterinarian named Jack Kelly, also known as Soldier (who is said to be as tough as a leather belt, and more, one can believe, when he pushes a palate with nails through 2 guys feet and puts them to the ground), learns that his family was killed and his sister was abducted. That's why he's doing a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still pretty thin. <br /> <br /> Now the acting. As an actor, I am qualified to say that this was some of the worst actors in art history !!!!! Llamas is good at himself. The donkeys who play the Clampets / Deliverance denials should be lined up and shot for their so-called performances, which offend actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break! The shootout is so good at BEST and the fist fight is unfortunate. I saw more real-looking fights at the Renaissance Festival (and they looked pretty fake!)! <br /> <br /> Reader, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ALL YOUR COST! IF IT WAS A ONLY FILM, YOU WANT TO AVOID IT! Do NOT watch this thing for the sake of your brain cell!
