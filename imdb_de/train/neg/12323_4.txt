Many agree that Origin is a beautiful anime. The music, the graphics and the world are beautiful and it truly stands above most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more, I suggest you look elsewhere. The beauty ends just before her appearance and when it comes to action and characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal and people are shallow, sometimes restless and unrealistic. Not to mention the action hole here and the action hole there ... So, in summary, oh my god, I've never seen such an adorable anime like this one; and oh my gosh, it's like ... - people - do not behave like that. It was a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime, but also a few steps back in times of poor characterization.
