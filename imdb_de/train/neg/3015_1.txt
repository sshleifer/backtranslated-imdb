This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bad guys either. This is a lousy worse. It was really painful to look at. The direction was terrible, there were many jumps and the green and yellow shades that were used throughout the movie make the characters look sick. Keira Knightly did not convince as a tough girl at all, and I can not believe that Lucy signed Liu and Mickey Rourke for this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was horrible and the acting was like fingernails on a blackboard. If you have not seen it, do not do it. You will not miss anything and will only spend two hours of your life seeing this jerk. I've seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them because of their mistakes. This is just a waste of time.
