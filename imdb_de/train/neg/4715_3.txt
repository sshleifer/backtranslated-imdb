I recently looked at Johnny Test to find humor. I have failed terribly. Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make its shows interesting to all viewers, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable and the ongoing gags are not gags at all. Children will love it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Well it does not mean that everything is bad. The original initial theme was actually quite catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton and figuratively destroyed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame because that was really one of the best things it had. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could theoretically be very interesting. With some work, the characters could work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. This, in turn, makes it easy for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit too fast. The episodes are too full and there is little time for clever writing. That's a pity, because there are so many interesting concepts that make the show come out. On the other hand, the fast pace will keep the kids from losing interest, and that's really the whole of the audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks great on paper, but does not do it. It's fun or interesting. This is a show that I like to like but I am not able to. There is just so much potential that is not realized. Kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
