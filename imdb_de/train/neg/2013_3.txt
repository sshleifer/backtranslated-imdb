This movie is about what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and (rather tame) sex scenes! The movie is not sure what he wants to be, and rather annoying. It looks more expensive than most films by director Al Adamson, but it's not the budget spectators expect from sci-fi movies. The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson movies, there are no previous big names or B-actors. Part of the music is fine, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
