I have nothing to comment on this movie. It's so bad that I had to post my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this "movie" ... even staring at the walls is better. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I also tell you that this is a low budget movie, bad acting, no actor name, a stupid mutt wolf and so on ... Even the story brings nothing new, the special effects are made in the style of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (do not watch this movie)
