Who likes terrible "comedy" shows like the little mosque in the prairie? I can only imagine two types of people watching this. They are: Muslims and self proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so enthusiastic that there is a show about Muslims that does not care if the show is good or even funny (which it is not). Two old people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is unbelievably predictable, badly written, outdated jokes. CBC really needs to take a look at what they do and who their audience is. If you write comedy only for really old people, guess what's going to happen, their audiences will die soon and they will not have an audience anymore. I wonder, who ever writes for this show? Do you think they are actually Muslim or hip, funny young people? No, I'll bet they are old white men who have been writing the same jokes for the same bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> If you look at the CBC comedy shows, Air Farce Nur has finally finally taken off (luckily!), but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer for which we pay, not to mention that poor excuse for the "comedy" Little Mosque on the prairie. It should be offensive and funny? Only the CBC would think that this lame show is offensive or funny. Shame on the CBC for wasting our tax money on shows that would only bother a few people.
