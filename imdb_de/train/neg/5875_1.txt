This film looks at two former football players, Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work as private eyes and get to know all sorts of men and women with bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who is having sex on the phone. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks him for help with some other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time and often go to Miami, Florida. Golf courses or a sports bar, where all sorts of things take place in the city. There are many punches, murders and many ambiguous words that bring this movie to zero. Do not waste your time, this film only cost me 50 cents and that was too much.
