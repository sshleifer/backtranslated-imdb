This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no action, no climax, no conflict or other important details needed to present a story. This "movie" is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his masculine side and the "tough guy he really is". I wasted my time completely watching this movie. The best part should be the credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my fingers off and thrown them to the producers. Anyone who mentally gave Toby Keith the chance to play in a feature film is obviously on the same intellectual level as him. Bottom line: Do not waste your time watching this movie, it could just be the one thing you regret.
