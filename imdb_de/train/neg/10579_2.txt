According to IMDb, Takashi Miike's Master of Horror segment imprint was banned in the US. So I thought I would translate the Swedish review I just wrote for you ... <br /> <br /> It was hard to have any expectations of Ichi The Killer director Takashi Miike's episode in Masters of Horror Series. And the DVD cover of Imprint actually looked very promising. <br /> <br /> The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese brothel, sometime in the 19th century, telling the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind and promised to to return. Tired and dejected, he arrives at the brothel and hopes that this will be the end of his long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and calm girl, knows about Komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as unfortunate as it is hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese were mostly fluent in American-English. But I'll leave it at that, it's not such a big deal. What is a big deal, however, is how miserable the rest of it was. Miike's story moves so slowly that I could look at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. The extensive Torurenzene, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the film, felt so unmotivated - and pornographic intrusive - that even THIS scene was not interesting. I felt it was violent, just for the sake of violence - without style and purpose. The only scenes that gave rise to some sort of emotion were the images of bloody fetuses rolling on the floor of the fast flowing water ... and, frankly, the only feelings they evoked were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist who seeks the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago, who is most memorable for me as Frank Nitti - Al Capone's white-robed assassin in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables (1987) , I always found Drago's portrayal of Nitti iced (and I mean that in a good way), and that was probably why I was almost annoyed when I thought he was so awful (NOT one) good kind). His acting seems to flow from no feeling and no empathy to depictions of a really bad transcription. As his character responded to the terrible things Komomo was exposed to, I sat on the sofa, twisting and turning to escape Drago's terrible drama. I am grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> The final is supposed to be daunting, maybe even repulsive and horrible, but I just thought it was somehow ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked again at my watch and just wish the shitty episode ended). Maybe the finale smiled a little at me, but that's just because I had to think of a series of Red Dwarf and the upturned chin of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, their eyes fixed on them. They look like aliens. Fortunately, if you have seen this episode and now decide to see imprint, I will have forever ruined the look of the end. <br /> <br /> My first thought when The imprint ended up finally with the only thing that made the pain of seeing worth listening to was the main theme of Edward Shearmur's (the same music that I believe that it is used in every episode of this series), and that - if any - is a big warning, do not you think? <br /> <br /> One could refer to the costume design of Michiko Kitamura and say that at least something is lacking in style and sophistication. But there are so many other movies and TV shows that it is much better to show the Japanese "geisha fashion". This is nothing short of inferior and I am disappointed. Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror episode is boring, unimaginative and pointless. In other words; It is really very bad!
