I'm not the only one to admire the first Superman movie, a movie that Richard Donner performed masterfully. I'm not alone in despising Richard Lester's Superman 2, which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie, unfortunately, it's still an absolute abomination. Unbelief is required in heavy doses, but Superman 2 puts things too far. It does not matter who led Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader. In a sense, there is no action, as the characters, unlike the original Superman, have no motivation to act the way they do. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible manner. There is too much to criticize, so I will not worry about it. I condemn this movie ... maybe the Slapstick in the Lester version is more in keeping with the moronic script that this film is based on. Super Duper bad.
