Oh, damn it, the MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like this cheap, kitschy parody of the 70s. The idea of ​​huge hordes of killer tomatoes destroying the United States is a great idea, and although the Moovie triggers a decent chuckle in spite of everything, the sight of frightened extras walking in front of big, obviously fake tomatoes is moister. Together with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, this film is one of the earlier attempts to make spoofs that became so popular in the 80s and 90s, thanks to Airplane! This, like most parodies, is quite poor. Many attempts of humor are bleak failures and will lead to much groaning. But thanks to the greedy tomato hordes, the vile "Puberty Love" song, and the incredible helicopter helicopter scene, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes delivers some goods, albeit for the most part for the wrong reasons. There are so many mistakes in this movie ... and it's hard to explain. Enough people must have enjoyed it too, when the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 Moore movies and a comic series !! Big chunks outside the tomatoes are pretty boring. And digging those 70s clothes, dude !! ; = 8) This tomato is shabby and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two. The MooCow says, grab a pizza and crackle in the tomatoes !! : ??
