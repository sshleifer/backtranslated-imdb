I had probably been spoiled when I first saw the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The adaptation of 1983 is such a disappointment. I just did not get chemistry between the two main stars. I do not really enjoy starring and acting, and what was the point of getting Tim into the role of Rochester? Had the casting director ever read the book? Very strange! He's a good actor, but he's definitely not Mr. Rochester! And Zelah was just a funny couple. In his favor, the minor castings were pretty good, and the Lowood scenes were the best adaptation for me, but in general, the magic of the novel could not be caught. I certainly would not ask anyone to regard it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointment!
