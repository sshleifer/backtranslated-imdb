At least it's not full of senseless violence or fluff. It is also not very thoughtful or a lithe plot. This story has some potential, but the director seems to have lost the green side. The story is incoherent and continues in foreign directions, to no conclusion. I do not think the director spent much time in a Golf Country Club either. Some of the representations are absurd. Not very appealing.
