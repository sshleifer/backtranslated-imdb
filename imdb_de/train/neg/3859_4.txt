Jason Lee is doing his best to make fun of a stupid situation, but the movie just can not make a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems unconventional and soon becomes a sexy cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair's characters should have acted in the opposite direction. (Selma Blair seems to be more intrusive than Julia.) <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization of a potentially real situation (that you do not catch yourself at a bachelor party with a pair of pants) lets and does not bend your cousin) who can not keep the promise. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter, and the cast (even if she's Miscast) does her best with sub-grade material that does not exceed the slippery theme. So instead of receiving a successful slaughter party (eg Animal House or American Pie), part of the humor and stupidity is left over (ala Meatballs 2 or so).
