This film was certainly the longest and the record breaking film. He had 30 actors. Nobody, according to JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), had the courage to do such a thing. <br /> <br /> The movie, as the title suggests, is based on the Kargil War, but the problem is that there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and songs of many characters are boring. <br /> <br /> Even if there are too many cinematographic freedoms, like killing people with knives, ask yourself what the soldier does? <br /> <br /> Director: JP Dutta fades away BORDER Music is fine <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan is tall under the huge cast, Saif is very good in his role and that too is his first Film with Kareena, Abhishek is sympathetic. Manoj Bajpai has his moments when Sanju is wasted. Suneil is okay. Akshaye Khanna is doing well. Rest is passable. Rani is good, Esha is okay. Rest is passable
