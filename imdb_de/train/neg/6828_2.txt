In a movie that follows a struggling actor who is obviously played by a struggling actor, Chris Klein has no advantage. He strives to bring something of memory into the role and winds his way through the flat writing that manages to show something that can only be described as a threadbare leader. The story exists, but that's all and does not show a basic beginning, middle and end, and the onlooker shrugs and feels as if nothing really has happened in the last hour and three quarters. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle is Fred Durst, who manages to differentiate himself from his seemingly talented co-stars, and he's halfway there to bring Legde's backward character to life. Whether Fred can handle this with a higher cast strength remains to be seen, but I will take care of him in the future.
