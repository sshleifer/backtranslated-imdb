Bela Lugosi is a scary, crazy scientist who uses orchids to recruit brides to steal life essence for an old woman. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious !! Many freaks plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this movie a nightmare. I loved it, as in the end all pieces fit together in a typical Hollywood way. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless when you watch. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would make boring flicks like these low, but the dwarf just added enough scary and fun to collect a few more points.
