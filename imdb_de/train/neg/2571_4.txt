With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you find that this does not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a terrible failure. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who is suddenly in a relationship with a really strange boy, not to mention the attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is unbelievably disconnected and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie does not prove it. <br /> <br /> The Arabella Cinderella song is pretty cool, but that's it. I recommend this movie only to people who enjoy watching a movie with extreme novelties, this is almost the definition of a movie. I think that more than anything else, this film is a sign of the times in terms of definitive experimentalism and unconventionality. <br /> <br /> Above all, Peter Sellers is a hit and miss. Context and style, but this movie had some fun moments. This is pointless and I am sad that someone in this film was as great as Peter Sellers. Recommended for anyone.
