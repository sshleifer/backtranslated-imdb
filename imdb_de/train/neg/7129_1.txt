This is best known for the Ferrari, who crashed when Eddie Griffin was promoted. <br /> <br /> The history of the race and the betting is a poor outcome of the numbers that seemingly have a director who does not see numbers. Largely a point and a shootout with a group of actors for a paycheck. This is not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be seen and end up as something worth filming no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Misogynist, despite the fact that one of the main roles is a woman. This is a movie that was clearly made to bring producer and director to pretty girls. Do you want proofs? There are long shots of women in virtually nothing that serve no purpose other than the rise of people who are afraid to rent a porn or the Sports Illustrated swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
