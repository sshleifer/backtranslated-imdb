For those who want to watch this movie? I would say go! Without the narrative it could be a very good movie / documentary. But the music, the narrative, and some of the implemented storylines make it very hard to look after a skeptic like me. After several animals one has in several seasons the feeling that it is an animal soap, which we observe. But the melodramatic point of view just does not cut it off for me when a predator finally catches a prey (an exception stays there), the camera zooms or jumps to another scene. I'm wondering why this would happen if they were showing the reality why the scenes cut so that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think morality is important to the masses of the crowd, because it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
