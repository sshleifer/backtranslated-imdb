Oh dear God. The idea that this film is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. Apart from the point that it seems to be written by a 5-year-old. The plot, the acting and even the props and the filming of this film were anything but a shame. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm not so critical of any movie because everyone has their style. But this movie was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and I think it should stay that way, because movies like this make the thriller genre a joke /> <br /> I recommend anyone who is a fan of thriller movies, or also just movies, to stay away from this movie.
