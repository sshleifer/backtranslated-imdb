This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of crazy characters on a stupid mission. Its distinctive highlight has brought together the entire cast of the film and fought for hidden money in a crazy moshpit. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "Kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; As clich√©d and absurd as his films may be, in the end I enjoy the comedy. However, most of his previous films were in a good mood (Hungama and Hera Pheri being remarkable). Now the fun of his films has faded, as he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is irritating and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is fine and Sharman Joshi is the best.
