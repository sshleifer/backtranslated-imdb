Absolutely terrible movie. Ameteur and it is not funny at all. The main role played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and Star Wars are just stupid. <br /> <br /> actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good thought about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Apart from Goksal, this movie is a garbage. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is still his worst written work to date. <br /> <br /> The music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actors Sumer Tilmac also have presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent at all.
