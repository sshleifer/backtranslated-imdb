Two old buddies are sent to Japan to obtain results of a videotape genetic study stolen by the black ninja at the beginning of the film. First, they only have to learn Ninja abilities, because "Only Ninja can defeat the Ninja." Sakura killers try hard to be a good ninja flick, but fail very much. The whole movie is so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say something good about it: dozens of times the same shift has been seen in different variations, characters are drawn too short, the direction is boring and the script is no surprise. Even in the final scene, which reduces the film value (trash can) itself. <br /> <br /> Even the 80s Ninja Flick fan, who understands the aesthetics of trash films, can hardly find this movie. It simply does not offer the viewer anything new, either in the visual plane or in the plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas swing, but it is not enough to determine the direction in which they should be, and similar combat scenes stun even the weakest viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend movie for everyone. Even Franco Nero's awkward performance in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind the sakura killer's American ninjas. Even on a visual level, Movie has no balls and it's a waste of time to find big battle scenes in this movie: There are none. All in all, one of the most futile ninja movies I've ever seen. Is not even interested in curiosity. Trust me in this case. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
