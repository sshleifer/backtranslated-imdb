Another Friday the 13th rip-off, even with some music! A group of young adults meets for a small high school reunion and begins to be slaughtered after Jason Voorhees. Could it be that the nerd they tormented at school would make routine slashfest fun for fans of the genre and include the usual T & A odds for movies if it does. The end is a bit more resourceful than the standard Slasher. MPAA: Rated for violence / language, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
