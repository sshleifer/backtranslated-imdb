I rated Basic Instinct 2 as high, but rated less than 4 in the movie. This movie has only 4 of me, but 7.3 of over 600 people. I see no reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This film is boring because it hardly leaves these rooms in this broken big house. And in this movie there are only 5 people. It's almost two hours, which is completely unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The film tone is also dark blue, which makes it difficult to watch. The movie can easily be shortened to a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" by Hou Hsiao hsien, that one is just as boring, the dialogues are just as boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching them after the first story was over. <br /> <br /> This movie has no passion or excitement.
