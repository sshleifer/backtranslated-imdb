... did you bother to make this movie? Someone? I would not have thought that. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that is getting on, rent Summer of '42. This is not a summer of '42. <br /> <br /> If your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard has more screen time, this is your first warning sign. And of course, for such an "artistic" movie There is plenty of cursing and flinging of the skin just to make it look artistic. <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual, uninteresting character out of cardboard, which was interrupted by moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of someone with bipolar disorder. Above all, Miller is famous for her looks and what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her. She misrepresented a real Pittsburgh aborigine. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard an incentive for his money in the style of cardboard. Impressive! Was this his first role after high school? <br /> <br /> So we have this weird triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but is with his boss / girlfriend. He can not put Miller to bed and put his boss to bed. So he hooks up with Sarsgaard & Miller and watches them tackle it. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller use it, a scene that we "treated". to every sloppy, moaning detail. To top it off, Foster & Sarsgaard continue with Foster in the Miller role. Now I know how there are two boys (as if that was ever something I needed to know). After all, all that remains is the tragic end of one character and the retrospective views of remaining 2. It puts me right in the pit of my stomach. Oh, wait! That was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I would like to have the time this movie took from my life, please.
