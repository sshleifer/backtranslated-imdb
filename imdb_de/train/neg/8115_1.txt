This movie was the most terrifying movie I've ever experienced, and what's worse, the fact that I had to look at it and had no opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Granted, the story was decent ... but I found the acting awful! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I found her performance wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her I could have endured the movie. Every time I say someone say, "daarling," I scare! I almost attacked a customer the other day because they said "it." It reminded me of one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if this has offended someone, just express my opinion.)
