First, some background; I am English and have lived all my life in London. I've been to The Den and most other clubs in London many times. I'm familiar with the kind of person who gets into hooliganism, and I know how they behave and how they speak. Have to say, this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie embarrassed. I felt like writing a mini-review because I felt like I was showing some things. <br /> <br /> a) People just do not talk that way in real life in London; The filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it seem stupid. Unfortunately, there are hooligan types, but the ones you see in Green Street are more of a parody. b) The actor playing Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded like "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. He's from the north of Newcastle and I'm just amazed that any of the other actors could keep his straight face next to him - how can we take him seriously? I do not know why they did not get someone from East London to play this role. I could have done a 'bang job' myself, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I expect Elijah Wood to seriously kick his ass when it's twice the size and are really bad hooligans? He would be dead. It's that simple. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will bomb here in the UK. Things could be a little better in the States because Americans just do not know (or worry) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these companies do exist, but it's all extremely subterranean and quiet and on a much smaller scale. The movie gets only a 2 of mine because they actually filmed in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect all of us to not notice.
