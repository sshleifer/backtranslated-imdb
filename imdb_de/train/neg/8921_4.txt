The premise of an African-American Scrooge in the modern, struggling city was inspired, but there is nothing else in this film. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserable banker who uses the employees and clients in the largely poor and black neighborhood she lives in. There is no doubt about the good intentions of those involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not fit well into the urban environment of this movie and the update does not work. Also, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly that the audience gets sick of it long enough before the film reaches its well-known end. This is a news movie that does not know when to stop. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson provides an excessive performance, and sometimes the lines are hard to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so often that it is a problem to adapt it to be fresh and relevant despite its very relevant message.
