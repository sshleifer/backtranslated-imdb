This show is terrible. How does George want to mock his mother's death? This show is terrible. The parents are obviously terrible and the children should be taken to kindergarten. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his loud and hideous sort of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I laughed at him a few times, but most of all at how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible, despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh about the way she treated George as a baby is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Can someone explain that Georges head is big, is it funny? It is not even that big! I have developed from the characters because they are too horrible and I would write to write, and I honestly do not care enough for that. It is important enough for me to tell anyone who looks at this and asks me if he wants to see this show or not, that this show is a lousy apology for a sitcom and is not worth your time. I give it starts 2 because the woman is extremely attractive.
