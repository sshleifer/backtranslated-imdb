... and we were told that there is an hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why was there no editor who told the writer / director to flick, flick snippets Apparently, the author / director made shorts before; In short, that would have been okay. However, the lack of dialogue begins to rub after twenty minutes. The lack of a lot of music bothers. The background noise (speaking, traffic and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) are aging very fast. But the worst mistake is in history. There is hardly anything beyond a short period of time. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw variations of the same scene again and again. I almost screamed on the screen: "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It's amazing that after leaving the theater, we were able to go home, see the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, prepare for the bed, and know that the audience was still trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to spoil your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
