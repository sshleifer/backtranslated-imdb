Oh man. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip off of Japan's Ringu. Well, I think the US did their version as well, but at least it was a pure remake. Very very sad. I enjoy watching Filipino movies and know that great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe that this had to happen. Claudine and Kris are so big names there, surprised that they were associated with plagiarism. For aspiring filmmakers in the Philippines, you do not have to stoop to earn money. There are many movie fans watching the films being aired by the Filipinos and enjoying them!
