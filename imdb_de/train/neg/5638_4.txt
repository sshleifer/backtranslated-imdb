Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy shootout between the happy couple, the exotic model in the deli and the vintage motel that (it would turn out) secretly watched from the woods and left the boys when they shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In the process, they blew up the frozen cabin, solved most of the problems; like the "whore bitch" on the windshield, the reason why the protagonist had "no friends", as well as his coolness under the pressure of the bloody tampon, incessant phone calls. , , and this creeping space-chic, the green thumb and his attraction for the simpler life. All the technician with the human body. Ex-abortion morgue? A little heartbeat would have been nice. <br /> <br /> It was fun watching these people, I think, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were stiflingly cliched, while the janitor attended too many yoga classes: a dick, a brains and a pickup truck rounded it up for him. I also wish they could have had a bit more luggage: Eleanora is ready to put black underwear in her smart red suitcase, and the janitor just needs a cardboard box in the motel. <br /> <br /> Little things you can say. I agree, even if the nagging things in this hurry job just did not get summed up properly. Good owl war, but I felt completely cold.
