It is a French film, LOL, with a focus on young girls with a lot of older men. Why are the French so focused on these kinds of things? When the age difference is so big, it really looks perverted! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she bears a strong resemblance to Olivia Hussey of Zeffirellis '68 Romeo and Juliet playing in a similar period), but she looks about 15 and the actor who plays Tassi, her painting teacher looks. .. 50 is KIND. <br /> <br /> On other posters, the historical record (in this case described in exceptional detail) of the true Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of the time (17th century). Her story speaks in modern times mainly because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" - she condemns this claim - and because the story of her rape process is so poignant to us. Not only was she clearly attacked and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to her assassin was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a serial rapist, possibly killing his wife and child. <Br /> <br /> The film does a terrible drawback by reversing this truly fascinating and remarkable story of life, which is very dramatic and does not require "spicing up" because it's "hotter" in some weird frencified way. to have is an overzealous teenager who draws male genitalia and has a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. This is "sexy" - the truth is boring and seems too feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> It also bothers me that this is ONLY part of the life of Artemisia, which is considered interesting for filming. The fact that she has painted for decades (her famous painting of Judith beheading Holfernes was NOT painted before the rape) that she was the first woman to be admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy that she had children. .. oh that's boring stuff. After all, it's a middle-aged woman, and they are not "hot" like teens. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are a lot of creative licenses when it comes to turning a movie (or a book) about a real movie into a historical character. You need to create a dialog, have subplots and create a dramatic structure. Surely some details can be sacrificed - it's not a big deal if the dates are postponed for a couple of years or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (if we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette ... and a big one Bone work had one, no thin Minny) or something like that. But turning their story around and turning rape into romance is actually sick and disconcerting. It's even worse because the director is female. She should be terribly ashamed! <br /> <br /> If you LIKE (and I know some people might care less about the real artist and like historical costumes and hot sex), you'll probably like "Dangerous" Beauty "with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack: Similarly based on a heavily rewritten story, with many billowing bosoms and jeweled cups: Bon appetit!
