It was a painful movie. It eats your heart while you watch it. I ask you: do not watch this movie! You will hate it if you lose 1.5 hours of your life! It's not like some movies that are so bad that you can see and enjoy them. This movie is boring because ... there is nothing so boring as this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie until the end. And you'll hate that you did not listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and watched this movie to the end. Now excuse me, I'll shoot myself. I saw everyone. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Do not look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
