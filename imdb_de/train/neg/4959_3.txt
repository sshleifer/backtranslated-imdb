Do you remember the good, old animated Batman show from the 90s? The one that people have praised? The ones that people of all ages can appreciate? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit? The one who had bad guys you could identify with? The one who had bad guys with real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. does not do it. Hence this filth. <br /> <br /> Do these people really know something about Batman? Have you ever looked at a Batman comic? Do you know that Batman was meant to be a detective? The compilation of 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a little more intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Bias'. Batman finds dead where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercially. Batman finds an obvious / stupid way out. Penguin escapes. Penguin makes something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung fu (by the way, everybody, and I mean, EVERYONE knows Kung Fu for some reason). Penguin of Batman punch. he is knocked out goes to Arkham. (Note: It's usually a different rogue in each episode.) <br /> <br /> Well, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the floor, maybe he's in the old amusement park!" Yes, maybe he has been there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I mentioned that, but everyone knows KUNG-FU! ALSO PINGUIN! what do you think? (probably because it's from the people who made this Jackie Chan cartoon) <br /> <br /> What really bothers me is that the show is just action. No smarts. None. If Batman has to think, he'll use technology, then a few kung fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget the bad guys. After all, what would Batman be without his rogue gallery? <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say a lot of praise for originality. I do not think other Batman media would have envisioned a Joker and a timid monkey man, an enigma like an emo, and a poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about it, is not your sexuality your main strength? ) <br /> <br /> What's even more crap is that every character is now a two-dimensional, stereotypical rogue. <br /> <br /> For example <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a power hungry madman obsessed with bats for unexplainable reasons. Penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> To notice a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive is Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Remember the Emmy Award? 'Heart of Ice' episode of Batman: The Animated Series to win? The one who gave Mr. Freeze motives for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in comics over its original backstory (Crazy Scientist)? The one who made him a victim with one goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin have admitted that as Freeze's origin in this P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and turns Mr. Freeze into a predator before his accident, who only has wealth in his head, then freezes and gives him the power to make things cold , Then he continues stealing jewels for no reason, while saying that he has lines like "Have a ice day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they have seen Batman & Robin. <br /> <br /> But Hey, look at the bright side. In this series you do not feel anything for the bad guys, that means you are a good person. Good for you.
