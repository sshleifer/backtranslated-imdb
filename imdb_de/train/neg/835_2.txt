I have seen both the Lion King and the Lion King II and both enjoyed it very much. I thought Lion King 1.5 was something to be proud of. What a disappointment ! Disney must be desperate for revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they have lost the deal with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just picked up a few shots that were still in the editor's floor (or trash can) and glued them to a <br /> <br /> fast dollar. Unlike LK I and II, both had strong storylines. <br /> <br /> This movie has hardly a story. While the characters and animations are always fun, there's simply not enough material for a movie here. Some of the bits might have been good 2nd plate fillers on the original offerings. Disney - Too bad you bring out this trash to make a quick buck! <br /> <br /> Next time Take the time and effort and continue our work.
