And a few "no". The Voodoo Academy is without doubt the least ambitious movie of all time. What exactly is it trying to do? To tell a story? Obviously not; As mentioned above, most of them are just legitimately legal people who rub themselves. Could it be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if not for the fact that it never goes beyond the most harmless and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which to the joy of no one repeats about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's some kind of horror movie; Is it trying to scare us? Unless the director wanted this through the total slowness and emptiness of his "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I have ever seen. It's like the Voodoo Academy taking the genres of horror, zombie and gay movies, putting them in a mill and then passing them through a coffee filter - except it's not the coffee filter that filters out coffee beans. That's all important , Nervous or somehow interesting out. The result is 74 minutes of film, which are as exciting as a glass of warm water - only without the opportunity to rehydrate you after the 10-day gin binge that will inevitably hit you as you observe this atrocity of human effort.
