The only words you have to be afraid of are more than Joe Don Baker, if you think of a movie, Greydon Clark, and when both are there, you're running for your life. This is a very funny movie, because they are really serious! It starts off badly and goes down from there, repeated scenes, the Good The Bad and the Ugly Like Shootout will make you roll to the floor laughing as he can. He sets his own rules, does things in his own way, wearing cowboy boots and sidearm cowboy style. You want to see a bad but funny movie? Continue, it's your movement!
