First of all a few things here: a) I am an anime fan - it has always been like that (I always saw Speed ​​Racer in preschool). b) I like some B movies because they are hilarious. c) I really like the Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> When the movie first comes out, it seems like it's going to be your usual B movie, except for the fucking FX, but all of a sudden BOOM! the anime is coming up! This is when the movie WWWAAAAAYYYYY goes downhill. <br /> <br /> The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than I remember SPEED RACER, for Crissakes! In fact, it is so cheap. One of the few scenes from the movie that I remember "vividly" is when a few children leave school ... and they are the same kids again and again! The FX are also terrible; The dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action animation is disorganized, the dialogue and voices (especially the English dub I watched) were horrible and I asked my dad to remove the tape from the DVD / VHS player. The only thing that survived was jokes and comments like the robots & Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie while surviving it. <br /> <br /> I plan to show this to another Otaku friend of mine on Halloween for a B-. Movie Night Because it's stupid to look rather painful and at the same time inadvertently funny, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I originally wanted to give it. <br /> <br /> (According to my grading scale: 3/10 means pretty boring and bad.) It's fun to count to three, unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will have fun counting to 15.)
