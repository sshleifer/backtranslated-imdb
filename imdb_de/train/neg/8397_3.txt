After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I was not the only person who was confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice as he goes down into a grave and pulls the lid after him. I anxiously awaited an explanation for this strange behavior ... of course, I assumed that he had something to do with the evil deeds in the house, but because he was killed by the first rising corpse (hereinafter referred to as zombie). 1) these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if anyone out there knows why Carradine was constantly descending into graves - let the rest of us in! <br /> <br /> All actions are limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try a summary. John Carradine comes to the cemetery to investigate and is throttled by Zombie # 1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler discover Carradine's body in a small moonlight shot in the cemetery. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from where Zombie # 1 surfaced, but manages to throw him into the open grave, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I think we can conclude that Strickler was dead all the time (a witch?), But why he turned from the normal look into a version with rotting flesh by flying into the grave of Zombie # 1 never explained. (Considering how incredibly slow these zombies are, I would have thought he would have preferred to stay in his "normal" form until his deal is completed.) This scene also reminds of a question - who is actually Zombie # 1 "We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown on the opening balance of the movie, but who knows which or why he has a special grudge against the film crew. <br /> <br / > Anyway, after that, Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the zombie # 2 slurp through the trees when we saw zombie # 1 (which leads to a momentary confusion about how many zombies really exist) In the best horror film fashion of the 1950s, Ireland manages to flee, conveniently banging his head against the small tombstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (was it not nice for John Carradine to carve a tombstone for a cat, which he hardly knew?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 has done so devastated in the house. He sends easily three film crew members and then goes up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him and thinks he is a lover of John Ireland, who has returned from his post-shooting. When she sees that it's just Zombie # 1, she lets out a scream and retreats to a bedroom where she finds Ireland's revolver. While Starlet Carole Wells takes a shower at this point and can not hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (drinking and pulling up the mirror in his bedroom) does it. He takes his sweet time (and only after a few more sips from his hip flask) and finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer in the last quarter of this movie is how slowly the stars are screaming and shooting). Domergue comes armed and ready in the hall, but confuses Macauley for Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He makes a nice acrobatic look over the railing, then Domergue retreats horrified into the waiting arms of Zombie # 1. Carole Wells is now out of the shower and will dry off when she hears shots and Domergue's screams; She also has no great urgency to find out. During this time, Zombie # 1 has time to untangle Domergue with a rope. Wells sees the hanging corpse of Domergue and faints. The next time we see them is in a creek outside the house (???) - but more on that later. Meanwhile, Ireland has regained his senses and stumbles into the house, where he discovers the bloody slaughter of zombie # 1. Although Ireland has just stumbled upon three murdered people, he is more worried that his film has been exposed and ruined! Luckily for him (and the audience), Zombie # 1 throws movie gear from the 2nd floor onto his head. That's the last thing we see about Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience is treated with a montage of all deaths, showing that the new ones "mirror" the ancients. How deep. <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2 has now arrived near the house (remember, these zombies are moving as slowly as molasses in January), where he happens to see Carole Wells swimming by in a stream and Pisces is you Out. How did she get there? Did Zombie # 1 beat her down, throw her in, and then zoom in just in time to destroy John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims had drowned in the tub, so Wells also has to drown (but why out in a creek rather than in the tub is never explained). Zombie # 2 never manages to get into the house himself (everyone is dead anyway thanks to zombie # 1), but instead he takes Carol Wells back to the cemetery. While the credits appear on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love in his arms, descending into the open grave. <br /> <br /> The viewer wonders: Yes, but was not this zombie tomb # 1? Why is Zombie # 2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie # 1 comes around and wants to get back in - will Zombie # 2 let him or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the recently deceased Carole Wells? And what about the late John Carradine - where is he? After all, we know from the earlier scenes that he's clearly at home in the grave ... If this plot of the finale has puzzled you, do not worry, because you're not alone.
