This movie was made by a bunch of white boys who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that except that it looks like it was made by a bunch of white men who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white men who are about the same age. It's almost like watching a couple of guys in the boys camp doing the camera themselves. The film has no action. It simply repeats the same action of the bloodbath after the carnage. There are some funny scenes and comedies. But they do not solve the flat monotony. <br /> <br /> The graphic animated scenes are used to cover up what was obviously out of budget or resources and is not very well suited for that. Anything that can not be done with white guys running blood over the beach is done with cheap animations. <br /> <br /> After watching the trailer, I saw this movie, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever will be. The rest just repeat the same banal, inhuman comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets boring when the same stuff comes to you again and again. It's more of a series of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a hit-you-over-the-head-it-art comedy. I can see where the story idea fascinates. But in this movie, the post-apocalyptic America Medevil England is very similar. In fact, Wheatlry says that the ideas of the story come from this time. He plans to do a second part. I think he thinks he is Tarrentino or maybe a parody thing. <br /> <br /> At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned that in Part 2 he will bring back pretty much the same cast. He was asked if in the next cast he might consider a more varied cast to which he answered, well, sure.
