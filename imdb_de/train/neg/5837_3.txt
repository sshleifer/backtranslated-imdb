I can not say that I liked the movie very much. It has some amusing moments, but it does not seem to be able to decide whether it is a comedy or a drama light in tone, to be a drama, and the amusing moments are few and far between , It does not make much sense either. Things seem to happen for no reason. And it's also extremely confused. If they had just taken a little time to explain things, it might have been a better movie. I would say that the end is anti-climatic, but that would mean that the rest of the movie had actually built up into something it did not do. It's just an end, and that's it. I did not find it boring, really, but as I said, there's no point. I'll be reluctant to give winter kills and weak 3/10
