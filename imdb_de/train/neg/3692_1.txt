Rajinikanth is reborn after gaining a magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are several issues that are obvious to the occasional audience: the 50-year-old Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the next-door girl's father believes he is a captivating "boy" ("Vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons. The worst part was how women were trained by housework earlier. Still, we have to believe that he is not a theist. Although well read, he wastes six of his seven powers for a stupid dragon. I can go on, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are gods, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth. The directory has difficulty inserting Rajinikanth in any of these categories. Originally Rajinikanth is just a Rajinikanth who does what Tamil heroes do - defend themselves against bad guys and, though she's the oldest, is courted by the prettiest woman in the film. Rajinikanth is doing well and some of the hallmarks of Rajinikanth are really entertaining - "Baba Count" is a novelty. What makes this film unbearable is that these few minutes are just a foreword to the worst book ever written. Even this preface has a comedy that is forced and obvious. The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; We see that the hero faces several hurdles (by politicians as usual), but we can not really look for the hero because we do not know what the hero's ultimate goal is. In the end, if everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another of his sermons and goes away to become a recluse. The director does not provide a solution to the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Either he shows spots of brilliance or he has not bothered to fully invest in this film - who can blame him. There is a scene in which Rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks, then throws the knife and begins his baba-count. The music is very suitable at the moment and acts as a catalyst for further tension. The songs are anything but mediocre, after a few years no one would deal with the songs from this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank that you can map to IMDb. This movie contains all the elements that justify its rightful place in the IMDb ranking.
