Zodiac Killer. 1 of 10. Worst acting ever. No really worst acting. David Hess (last house on the left? No. One of the seventies? Rent it, it's really good) is the worst of the group (pretty tough competition, but he's amazingly God-fearing) a home theater affiliate with such to find a cumbersome camera presence. The film screams to an overwhelming painful stoppage when it's on the screen. Not that the movie actually has redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess that he can ruin. It is taken with a home camera and looks quite old, including boom microphone. Also no post-processing. Come on, there must be some Shovelware that a five year old computer could use to clean up this image. Take bizarre stock footage of autopsies and aircraft carriers, and this is a visually messed up image. The autopsy images are inserted as Italian cannibal films use these god-fearing real-life animal killers. And the Navy's stuff is supposed to be an anti-war statement (because we know all the bloodthirsty insane people join the Navy.) What on earth is Lion's Gate to liberate that garbage? It would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry ?? No, the one from the Seventies Rent out that it's really good.) Someone gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume that the Zodiac killer is back? Eh-huh What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder, and in which the relationship between the young killer and the older man resembles that of a congressional side and a closed congressman? The haircuts and production values ​​of the eighties meet a Nambla subdivision. Sign me up.
