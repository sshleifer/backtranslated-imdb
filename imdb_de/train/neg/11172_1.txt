The undeservedly popular "I Love the 80's" from 2002 is an insane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of terrible television programs that ultimately spelled the end of VH1 the only real one music-oriented channels on TV! I practically lived on VH1 until spring or winter. I forget, which from 2002 when garbage like this started to occur without any reason. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I suppose you call it that), I had decided that I would go ahead and watch it in the first night anyway, even though the ads looked like crap. At least I can honestly say that I was not a bit disappointed because my expectations were initially obviously a basement. The focus of the show, which I found out within the first five minutes, was less about each year of the 1980s and what was and was culturally significant or popular (which I expected), but rather a spontaneous platform for quite a few terrible no-name comedians to show off their comedic skills that they think is likely * * rolls their eyes * ... more like a want of it, if you ask me! It's pretty easy to see why no one has heard of these idiots before they appeared on this show, because they are all so terribly inglorious and pathetic when they try the so-called "humor" that I swear I feel my gut can knot with any rancid one-liners they've shot down one after another! All in all, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / are the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.
