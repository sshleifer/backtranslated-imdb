After seeing KHAKEE, I felt I could watch another good movie, but unfortunately. The movie is a joke and really hard at showing Aryeman Afterall. His father Keshu is the producer. <br/> <br /> RKS talked so much about the movie During the promotions, he said that the film contains meat in contrast to the films of that time. I wonder what movies he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a typical Masala movie with a lot of comedy, romance, action and everything that mixes everything up. <br /> <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts of all time. Imagine children kidnapping Dawood's family. <br /> <br /> The end is a complete mess with a sudden change in characterization <br /> RKS indicates its hitherto weakest movie, except for some Bachchan scenes, the movie is boring. <br /> <br /> Music is boring. <br/> <br/> Amitabh tries to give his role all in all he does his part well although he is not his best even though he pulls his face too hard when he pulls a trigger and a funny look makes while smoking the cigar H. Also the dubbing is not fitting properly. <br /> <br /> Akshay is here for a few minutes and just repeats his act and ham. <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems expressionless, trying too hard, but exaggerating some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika shows the best of the crowd <br /> <br /> The rest is fine
