I enjoyed the feeling of the first few minutes, but after 20 minutes I generously applied the fast-forward button. Too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) going down the hall from room to room, through doors and down the street, as well as many shots of him looking thoughtful and confused. It gave me the impression that the story was originally intended as a short film (20-30 minutes), and then became a love piece between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they wrote the script). > <br /> It might have been more entertaining if one of the characters had said something that I had not heard before in many other films, or if the end was not - disappointing - the one that I had predicted three minutes into the Film (atypical for an independent / smaller studio film). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not ordinary Hollywood manipulation nonsense.
