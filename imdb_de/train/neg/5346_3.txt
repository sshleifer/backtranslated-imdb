I had to watch this movie because the plot was so rude and the movie met expectations. In fact, it is sometimes quite uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual antics are kept to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unnecessary and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy, combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery, and fails in every respect. It's as if Meyer has tried to offset the sexploitation / blackploitation with a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about being turned over by the obvious domina connotations of the early scene, in which Lady Susan lashes out in a provocative outfit. Then he tries to return to the way of the righteous by making a film about the triumph of good over evil. But since they cancel each other out, you do not end up with anything. <br /> <br /> Because it's so bad in so many ways, it's really worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie possible flavor at worst. Maybe because it's so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.
