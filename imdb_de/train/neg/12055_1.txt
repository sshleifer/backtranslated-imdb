Do not spend your money or your time on this pathetic movie in the guise of cinematography. If every third word is dedicated to the swear word, there is no real conspiracy and no cast of old actors who still play the role. The same dated past achievements that have not developed in their careers leave much to be desired. From the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro, I expected something better. The vision others have of Puertorricans is irreversibly distorted by garbage like Maldeamores. A nasty word at a certain point in a movie can be used to emphasize a particular point of view, and may even be funny or sad, depending on the context (see, for example, Elsa and Fred), but it should not permeate the plot. The film is totally embarrassing and it was absolutely nothing funny or cute about this movie.
