For those who want a remake of 1989's Slaves of New York. What is there, seven of you? Here it is ... was. <br /> <br /> This undercooked movie has diligently unremarkable characters (well, they're club kids, yes, a big idiot!) that are in patterns. The big question seems to be, how long can a young adult still remain teen? It took three people to write this "story"? Good God, it was easier to come with Citizen Kane. Instead of taking the audience back, this film was meant to embarrass anyone who was a scene star at the beginning of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman envies a bunch of selfish children over another era is the world, as only herself, twenty years can imagine. The weird sidebar about library work is not the subplot one expects from Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. Your "I'm serious about the graduate school!" while a stripper is dragging on her, she is hysterical. Posey's shit is always amusing, but there are projects under her. I slept before the 40-minute mark was exceeded.
