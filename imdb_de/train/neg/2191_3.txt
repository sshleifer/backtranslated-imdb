A doctor trying to fulfill the medical dream of a transplant secretly experiments with hospital corpses with varying degrees of success. His last best chance is that he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he rescues him from a burning vehicle. I searched for cheese and believed that I found it. It has everything bad movie hunters are looking for - breast and brain surgery, where surgeons use flawless white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love to watch the rear wheels of the car), cheesy clarinet stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in film history. But unfortunately, these can be so bad, they are not the good moments can not be overcome. <br /> Jan in the pan annoyed me with her thunderous monologues in a hoarse whisper, a little less than wicked laughter, and the fact that she was kept alive with a Colombian brew coffee and 2 DD batteries. I could not even talk to Dr Bill's horrible exaggeration and moral self-righteousness. Normally, such a ham makes these films a must in my opinion, in which case I was bored. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960s version of "Body Shopping" and I even nodded during that time. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on this one - there are better bad movies to entertain your sick sense of humor.
