The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle a lot of material (including opening and closing titles) from Criminally Insane. The new footage shot on video is really bad. Scenes lack the right light, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video issues like scrolling images, etc. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, it basically just repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills anyone who shares their living space, often for reasons that make them stand in the way of the food they want. <br /> <br /> At least it's just an extra on the DVD for the first one, which also includes the same director's film Satan's Black Wedding. Too bad that the films of Death Nurse are not there.
