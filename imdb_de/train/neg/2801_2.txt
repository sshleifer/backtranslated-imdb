After a quasi-gothic, purely fruity music video, the film begins with Cassidy, the singer who kills himself. In a perfect world, that would be it and the credits would roll. We do not live in this world. The dull band members decide to go to a clown to get in touch with their dead essence. When I say clown, I mean actual clown. He tells them that they will all die through Cassidy's mind (the mind owns Dora, one of the bandmates). We do not care, as the characters are boring, dap and extremely terrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly fitting surname, if ever there was one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, according to The Attendant and Tower of Blood HSS, needs to know he's making a living all the time), this movie is a permanent one Battle between the incompetence of the film and the need of the viewer to stay awake. Not enough blood to soothe gore dogs nor enough nudity to satisfy perverts. This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway gets topless <br /> <br /> Where I am saw it: Starz on Demand
