If I could really rate this movie, it would probably be in the minuses. Although I respect the fact that someone has to keep turning those horrible "horror movies" around, it's a waste of money to buy a ticket to this film. Though it's a horror movie, there's nothing terrifying about it except the idea of How many horror clich√©s you can put into a movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it would probably have made a better movie in the long run. Whoever made this version of "Prom Night" screwed it up. The actors would probably have done a decent job if the questionable script had not been. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I would rather see "One Missed Call" again, at least that had a conspiracy.
