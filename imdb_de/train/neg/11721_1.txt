This movie was awful. The script is FULLY unrealistic, but written to be in the real world. The editing and lighting effects are worse than most of the first projects at the film school: A) knows every detail about the world of police or covert operations. B) knows every detail about filmmaking or appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or below average mind, I think it would be nice if I was a fool. If you have to watch this movie with your brains, I recommend a kind of drunkenness. <br /> <br /> It is a total waste of low production value.
