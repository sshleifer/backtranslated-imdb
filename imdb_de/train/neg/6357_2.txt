I am so disappointed. In this film, I felt driven out of my time and my mental energy. Here again was the epitome of the Woody Allen movie: The upper-class neurotic Manhattaners debated whether to cheat on their spouses or not. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen the story of you ten times already. Where did your creativity go ??? You have to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change with her. <br /> <br /> There are far more interesting and funnier scenarios that you can apply to your anxiety disorder and neurotics rather than washing the same old slops over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project, it does not do anything for me - because now I'm expecting his old standby: the couple who gets tired and in the end cheats. Depressing and the same age, the same age. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win back his fans, he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence needs to be stimulated - not offended.
