"Magnolia" is an absurd, confusing shop window that does not count enough. Like "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is an aimless series of episodes that do not care about coherence. The camera races through corridors and corridors and sees sad characters. Where is the reason to take care of these people? The general theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who are not interested in others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters) and are self-destructive idiots who either fall apart or die. I was reminded how much I did not like "Shine" because of the incurable monster of a father of Armin Muller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappetizing characters here, why should we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> With that said, there is nothing to hold back Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandonment. There are two ideas, especially this bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. The camera changes from character to character as each of Aimee Mann's Coffeehouse folksongs sings. Cute, but ineffective, because we can not see what connects them all. The other idea to which I refer can not be revealed except to say that it is totally unexpected and completely ridiculous. Especially Tom Cruise, who unleashes a performance that I did not know was in him. And John C. Reilly is playing the most decent and really good cop lately. But that does not help. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theater could not stand it anymore and said, "That's stupid!" I think the majority of the audience will agree.
