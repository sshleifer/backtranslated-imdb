Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakespeare's obscure, rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s musical. This leads to both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy, since the actors are seldom sent to one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder bad in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who appears to be hysterical as Costard, but he is mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with Shakespearean language, with the authority of a youthful Valley Girl writing the script you read intermediate English lessons. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are staged with the know-how of a high school production of "Dames at Sea", with the cast and dance cast being awkward and amateurish, with the sole exception of Adrian Lester, who proves to be a great song and dance man. The only other salvation of the film are Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's contribution as Eye Candy, but they have performed far better than in this film, and it would be wise to review some of the other titles in their filmographies without messing up a passport.
