This movie will be a hit for those who enjoy Sophomoronic, unthinking, explicit allusions to sexual exploitation and F ... in almost every sentence. How a good action? Like a comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from Whipped. It was so bad that I left after about half an hour. I saw two kids slip into this area, which looked like 10 - very damaging - that deserves an X.
