First and foremost, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, as the usual pattern for the success of a box office entrance is when you hit below the waist. This film is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this film is to make money by touching a sensitive moral (in fact, this is considered taboo in most countries), but the spectacle is almost perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background, trying to compensate for the lack of Altioklar. Talent! All members of the cast were perfectly attuned to their roles and well-qualified, even the less experienced. (Like Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a little word of recognition just because he knows the cast well. Otherwise, he is just a media monkey who poses as an artistically gifted director. Come on, art is not just about dealing with naked / half-naked women. And just because the media boast, no director is a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and wait for something artistic. I am looking forward to welcoming your next work. Hope this time you are creating an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good spectacles, hot women (just kidding!) :) Disadvantages> Anything and anything but the cast
