Hmmm ... where should I start? How was a serious actress like Demi Moore involved in such a crap? "First Blood" could be considered a bullshit, but that kind of nonsense is just Rambo with tits. If you're interested in the Crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals), this is the stupidest clich√© I can think of, you say "GI Jane" is awesome movie. Alone the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable, but hell, I can not imagine that Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not during the last useless 30 minutes). Ridley Scott did not deserve to turn this film into a movie intended for women of equal rights. It's just mindless propaganda for the American army. To make them more attractive, they've dropped Moore into the movie. Terrible movie.
