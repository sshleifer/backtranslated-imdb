Notice that I gave this 1 star, if the option had been given, I would have given that zero. When I put this DVD in my TV and sat on the couch, I expected the movie to be the worst. I checked this movie in IMDb and found it to be the worst rated movie. I think I have addressed every mistake critically. But it did not prepare me for the crap that was just spitting out of my TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this movie look good. DO NOT LET THIS FOLLOW. This movie has to be banished from every shelf in the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe the movie is like porn, but without sex scenes. Acting (if you can call it that), the "plot" (as many holes must look like Swiss cheese) and the special effects are really awful. <br /> <br /> Please do not like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to look at it. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying that I can make a better movie than this, but I think about it.
