I'll say it again: this movie was totally lame. Kids will like it, sure, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was basically a reissue of the original, which is to be expected since they thought a lot about the whole concept in the first movie, but did they still have to completely rework the entire movie? I mean, everything is reworked by the little mermaid. The worst is Morgana "Ursula's Crazy Sister," who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous as Triton is present with his magical trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the act forced him to do nothing. I could go on, but I will not. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to gain more money from the Little Mermaid, and was apparently thrown together without thought because they knew it would sell. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
