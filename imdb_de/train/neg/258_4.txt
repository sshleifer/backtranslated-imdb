I saw a movie with Jamie Foxx for the first time and I bet it will be my last. I could not understand why he was funny, although people in the audience found it funny when he made a face to the camera or because he said, "I'm taking a shower." <br /> <br /> The Plot is completely predictable. The evil comes after the good. The good one has a wife, so evil uses her. In between, the officials fail. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you do not do your homework to solve a trivial puzzle and shooting is MTV-style. Do not waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
