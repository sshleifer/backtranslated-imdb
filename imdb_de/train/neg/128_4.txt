This film, once sensational for its forward-looking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, eventually became mere curiosity. It now seems absurd that this mostly boring little film has been banned and confiscated by governments in many countries. In view of how socialist Sweden eventually became, after four decades the once controversial "radicalism" of its politics appears naive and almost mainstream. And his sex scenes, once the subject of sensational obscenity, seem pretty tame in a modern context. Nonetheless, the film and the accompanying documentaries detailing the many controversies and influences remain marginal as an early relic of the 1960s youth uprisings. Part of the film that still stands up: its self-confidence in relation to the "fourth wall". Every now and then the filmmakers themselves film how they make the film. The satirical playfulness still triggers a giggle.
