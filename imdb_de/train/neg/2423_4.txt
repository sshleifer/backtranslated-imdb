I got this movie from a private collector and was very curious. In IMDb there were 7.8 (only 9 votes) and some external comments were pleasant. But I have to say that it is a very ordinary and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the movie is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but even though it did not bore me at all, the story is so common and the things that seem so normal that I did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can make some laughs. And you can see some small tits. But if you like the kind of giallos that I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsensical, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murders ...), you will not appreciate the movie's good direction and cut and the twists and turns that make up the movie Make a movie entertaining. But it could be a lot better.
