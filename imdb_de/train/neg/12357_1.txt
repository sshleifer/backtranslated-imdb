I am short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone who had a room temperature IQ. I'm sorry, liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. You can forget the design or even be in combat. Will not happen It's hard to understand or accept that men and women are physically different. Despite the fact that it is 2007, reality can not change anything so that people can not hurt their feelings. Men can not give birth or breastfeed babies (Oh, I forgot San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women do not have the physical strength to be at eye level when fighting with men or other physically challenged situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? After all, I could not give a damned cry in hell if what I just wrote upset you. Think about it - if this upsets you, that only warms my heart more. I have not written anything that is not the truth. This crappy movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one.
