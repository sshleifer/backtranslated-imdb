Every now and then someone looks at me a bit out of the blue and asks "What about SNITCH'D"? I know right away that they have a case of barely hidden amusement + horror. Look, I was the cinematographer of the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points regarding this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally called SNITCH'D ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, one day after wrapping TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that, like so many indie features of the era, never went on sale despite festival awards ... it fell fine pressure of the SAG to eternal victim notorious experimental feature contract. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> I thought I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster strip in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000, I did not want to keep up it. Finally, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I too believed in the myth then. <br /> <br /> Just explain it to us as a "film school" for many involved, including me. SNITCH'D was filmed in August 1999 in two weeks in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught drama at a grammar school in the latter city (yes, he is drama and English teacher ... keep that in mind when watching the movie or even watching the use of apostrophe in the title), hence the places and the performers. <Br In his cast was the only well-known dramatic performance by weather girl Vera Jimenez, Channel 2's Morning News in LA, and more importantly, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was eager as I was, a movie under the belt to get. I have to say that her professional commitment, her concentration and the attitude "Let's do that" inspired me and was a prelude to her fame, which is yet to come. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, low light or power, multiple boom operators, and the provision of an uncorrected off-line duplicator. None of this overshadows the actual content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Until 2003, however, the film was sold to distributors (with a net loss, I understand) that inexplicably did not have any pictures of Eva box (until then she was an aspiring, working name), but it did managed to get a clear picture of a seemingly latin gangster who lends credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's other passion is in antiquarian business, it seems to confirm that you believe you can actually judge a book by its cover ... because so many have put this DVD on their sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, met and I met James for a day to shoot a simple short film he had put together, SPLIT SECOND I think has never seen a game despite the festival intent. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie entitled JUAREZ, Mexico. I thought he had clarified the process; My participation depended on casting, screenplay, and crew control, and the resulting film actually looked promising in daily newspapers, as it were ... a cheap detective story around the mass murders of girls in Juarez; Despite allegations here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared at any festival or venue, though Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has distribution and was just waiting to be released to release a DVD of two studio pictures on the same topic, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER CITY.
