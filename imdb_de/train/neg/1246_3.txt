Spoiler, I think. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the end ruins the entire movie. I just could not overcome it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I had suddenly collided on a planet full of talking monkeys, I would be like "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! But he's like" talking monkeys, okay. Anyway, this is pretty dull, I'd say, he has to come across strangers on a regular basis, and besides, this is Rick Baker's best work so far, this film is a true testament to how far we have come in monkey make-up 3/10.
