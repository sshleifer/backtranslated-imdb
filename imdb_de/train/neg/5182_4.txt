Like most festivals, Hamilton has an interesting clock that has all the ideas and little implementation. Although the film is impressive for the apparently low budget, the film faltered in its final twist and becomes awfully long as it expands and becomes obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous outsiders trying to survive after the death of their parents. They kidnap people, empty the blood and feed something trapped in their basement. Mckellhar and Firgens have some nice, dark-humorous performances, and the rest is just like that. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing. But for the first half, a strangely humorous and dark mixture knocks, which is a surprising achievement. The next half is not so successful, because with unrealistic turns it gets into a film oblivion and becomes a ridiculously playful finale, which turns the entire movie into a total crap. It is a shame, though undoubtedly some talents have been involved in this production, and although it is deeply flawed, it remains original and creative. pity that it completely fails in delivery at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
