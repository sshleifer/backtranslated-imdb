This is the kind of movie you regret in your VCR. It's a weird bad rip off version of Stephen King's movie "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this movie got a score of 5.2, because it has no story and when the movie was finally over, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should appear as a short film instead of spending too much time on it. And as in any bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie in a timeframe of 10 to 15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So before you decide to watch this movie, make sure you have a few of them Put new batteries in your remote because you'll do a lot of fast forwarding ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
