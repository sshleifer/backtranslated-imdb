The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad, but unfortunately the story in the middle gets a bit boring and the excessive use of footage as well as bad special effects let this movie sink to a subordinate level. <Br /> <br /> The movie begins with a rocket heading toward Earth. In a panic, because it is about to hit Earth, the Soviets manage to distract the object. However, this is not necessarily good as this seemingly unmanned ship has a contrail that destroys everything in the way and the ship is now in low orbit over the planet. In other words, each passage is followed by part of the death - one that could kill us all !! So it's up to the good scientists of the United States (led by a very young and barely recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us - and above all to save New York, which is in direct orbit! Unfortunately, they can not save Ottawa (I've never been there before, so I can not say if this is a big loss or not), but thanks to the good old American know-how, they can eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> As you can see, the story idea is not bad and original. But so many old clips of fighter jets and guys doing radar scans are getting a bit old and it seemed like they were filled up. All in all a decent, but hardly inspired movie that extreme fans of the genre like - everyone else sees it at their own risk.
