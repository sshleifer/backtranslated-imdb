This is one of the worst B-Slashers I've ever seen in my life. The end is something you have to see to believe. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs watching their mother as her father comes down the fireplace in a santa suit. He puts the gifts under the tree, eats the biscuits and milk and then goes up the fireplace. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry just comes down and finds his dad in a santa suit sexually pleasing his mother. Then Harry goes up the stairs, smashes a snow globe, grabs a piece of broken glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then it goes on into the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man sleeping in a santa suit and watching little children through binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children and the other for bad children. He writes down everything they do in these books. The guy is a scary. He also works in the toy factory Jolly Dream. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds out his boss is just about winning, he collects all the toys and delivers them to a couple of kids. Then he travels to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree. The kids catch him, but they go back to bed. So Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the dad and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he approaches a house, he is spotted by a bunch of kids and run to him. The parents are nervous and try to get their children to return to them so they do not hurt themselves. How do you know that Harry is the killer? Sure, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it might be. Harry gives presents to the children and the father pulls out a switchboard to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs away, the citizens flare up and follow him to kill him. You do not even know he's the killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, his brother and he talk and he and Phillip strangle him. He just loses consciousness. Phillip loads Harry back in his van. When Harry wakes up, he starts. <br /> <br /> The end is something I could not believe. You have to see it again to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me was Black Santa. That's right, the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man. Why did you bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You get your money worth seeing these two films. You are better than this garbage heap! I give this movie 1 out of 10 stars. I wish I could give it 0 stars, because that's what this movie deserves.
