SPLIT SECOND was maybe a good movie. A story about "Murder on the Road" has a very young Clive Owen doing a pretty good job; BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camerawork and really terrible cut. The camera jumps (presumably) across the entire creation in an unsuccessful attempt to reflect Owen's stress on business, family and traffic. What this actually means is to give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Since the filmmakers did not care to make a good movie, but only impress with their idiotic photography, you should not waste time with this travesty.
