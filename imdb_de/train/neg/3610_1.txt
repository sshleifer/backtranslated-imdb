A patient escapes from a mental hospital and kills one of his guardians and a university professor after he's on his way to the local college. In the next semester, the late professor and a new group of students will have to deal with a new series of murders. The dialogue is so clich√©d that I can hardly believe that I could predict lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap films thrown together in the mid-Slasher era of the 1980s. Although the heroine is killed, this is just inferior garbage. Terrible drama, terrible screenplay, terrible effects, terrible horrible terrible !! "Splatter University" is just good for your VCR if you have nothing better to do. I suggest, however, to look at your head cleaning tape, that would be more entertaining. Skip it and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rated with R for strong violence in graphics, obscenity, short nudity and sexual situations.
