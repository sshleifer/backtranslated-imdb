I had the greatest enthusiasm for the screening of this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to humanity, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (before Tolkien). I have to say that it was a huge disappointment. They completely made the plot a joke and turned the thing into a long soap opera. The elements that were faithful to the conspiracy were sprayed in such a random manner that the audience often laughed at the silly script that paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) in "Fabio on the Beach" in the guise of Pitt (who co-starred With a good script and more effort this could have been the most complex and original warrior character Hollywood has ever produced, the actors were actually decent and tried to make the most of a ridiculous screenplay - it was indeed a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic.) Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it does not even hold a candle for them.There are plenty of guys for the ladies, but not enough fight scenes for a movie made by I would recommend to anyone to pay for this story as one of the F is dragged through the mud (at least they got that role right).
