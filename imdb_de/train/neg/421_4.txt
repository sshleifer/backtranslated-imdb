My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you've seen the "planet earth" of the BBC, which I'm sure you have most of them, then you will not like this movie too much. I own all the discs of "Planet Earth" that I rated very highly for the movie and read good reviews about it. I was excited to look at it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw that it was a Disney movie featuring production companies BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them on my DVDs at home from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie went on and on and on and on and on, me and my friends got stuck The scenes were all from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because I think that 90% of the photos are from "Planet Earth". I say 90% because I did not recognize some scenes. I feel like I just do not remember her. <br /> <br /> So, what is the movie really? It contains a compilation of various foot sections of the various slices of "Planet Earth" with a narrative aimed at children. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the Polar Boys leaving the mother boy, the narrator says, "The Polar Boys are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers." (I do not remember the exact words, but that's the way it is This is a condensed "Planet Earth" for kids!
