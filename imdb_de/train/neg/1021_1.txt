The film started heavily, LL Cool J (Deed) as a covert police officer, along with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott out of practice, possibly misunderstood as a villain?) And committed robbery and murder. The act refuses to kill the drug dealer, which triggers the conscience conflict of a dirty policeman. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al.) Are well staffed and the movie promises. <br /> <br /> As soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced, the movie does not start anymore. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people might see repeatedly, or a movie where female girls drop by because of Timberlake, I would choose the former one. Even talented actors have to work hard on their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no hard work can save him. I thought he would do a better show because he has been talented for years. Everything he did in this movie was unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, he does not automatically translate that he can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the apparent lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are some storylines, such as Pollack's sudden sniper skill and the fatal operation of storage machinery. This movie had promised so much. Deeply disappointing.
