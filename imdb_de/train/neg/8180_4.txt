The reason for the DVD release of this film in black and white is that no one can get a color of this public domain film, at best, a modest sea story in the hands. Distributed for television through Allied artists, DVDs (or VHS), which are on the market at this time, all come from the same 16-mm television printing. Films distributed to television before 1963 were often distributed in black-and-white, since most of the viewers had no color palette anyway. Remarkable black-and-white prints for television were also more favorable, as several prints were often used for all channels that handle a film on a syndicated basis.
