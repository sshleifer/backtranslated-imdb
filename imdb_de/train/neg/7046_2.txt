I've seen that boring waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so innocent and obviously assuming it's a comedy. But here is absolutely nothing funny. A good cast is basically a script I could have written with my left buttock after it had been struck meaningless by the torturers of the 15th-century Inquisition. The first half is especially bad, as there are some of the most boring and meaningless dialogues I've met in a long time, and a zero-point-zero plot that you could talk about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are featured in this little movie and this movie has less than 1000 votes on this page should tell you everything. A few nice shots of waves hit the cold British coast, but that's it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that is made only because the people who wrote it have good connections (preferably family connections) and / or lots of money lying around.
