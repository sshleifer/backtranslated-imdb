Although Jerry Jameson's production and direction are definitely an improvement, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": smooth, commercial garbage that leaves a decent cast (this time in the truest sense of the word). Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner that is abducted by art thieves and plunges into the sea (the general public claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but in the film itself). When the rescue ships come to lift the plane out of the water, we see their cranes (quite blindly) falling into the ocean, and it's hard not to laugh (imagine how the cranes clog the plane, the passengers and the flooded writing). NBC radiated the seemingly "Director's Cut", adding at least an hour of additional material - mostly flashbacks - with all the subtleties of a "Gilligan's Island" episode into the process. The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some players have a bit of fun: Lee Grant is a disgusting drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting Oldsters. Nevertheless, the personality conflicts and the agonizing military detail tear the patience. ** from ****
