The first half of this release was the best I've ever seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was extraordinary. Then it was like saying, "Oh, that's too long," and tearing the rest of the story to pieces. The main scenes, if any, are so whitewashed, combined and put in order that they completely change the plot. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for someone who did not know history to follow it. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then destroyed the end of it.
