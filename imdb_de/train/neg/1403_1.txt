An absolutely wretched movie waste !! Nothing happens. No ghosts, no train, no secret, no interest. The constant and BRUTAL attempts of the comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a group of people stranded in the middle of no location because their train was held for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves them no room to rest in a heavy storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can go 4 miles over the black fields. Um, yes. For sure. Or they can force themselves for the hospitality of the railway and stay at the "frequented" station. A station that proved utterly deadly, completely devoid of ghost, interest or conspiracy. <br /> <br /> So dreadfully boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> That should be added to the list of lost movies !! aargh !!
