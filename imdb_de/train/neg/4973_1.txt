I paused for five minutes as Beowulf got an automatic double-arm crossbow that had the eye on it. Crossbows not only do not have a riflescope, but Beowulf defeats Grendel in close combat. The terrible, wooden spectacle and the eternal darkness that plague all sci-fi original films did not help either. I had only a few minutes before I felt my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead. That's all I have to say. But you could only say that it is a TV movie that can be made just for watching TV, and skip it right there. <br /> <br /> A farce.
