This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is able to offer much more than this movie. He's on the bus while he's apparently anti-racist, doing nothing but scolding White and worsening the black status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men traveling by bus to Louis Farrakhan's million-dollar march. The bus has every type of person you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger, and uncle Tom (but he's thrown off the bus). It was a single white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist when he got on the bus to drive. Although he is a Jew and has explained the fact that this is a situation, he was ultimately a racist and left the bus. This should not be seen as a triumph, but as a sad disappointment. You may think I'm racist because I wrote that, but I mean it well. Good luck next time.
