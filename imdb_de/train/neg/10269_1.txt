This movie is unheard of. with outrageous I mean terribly. I had more fun drying the paint on my local hardware store on an August day while suffering from migraine and heat stroke. Acting became progressively worse as the movie progressed, and the directors taking euphoric medications became clear with the final scenes. When Misty was shot to death, she decided it would be wise to blink after the murder. that was not intelligent. Truly, Stevie Wonder could have caught it with her eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun while intoxicated and watch this movie, remember that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
