The only reason this film is rated 1 is that zero is not one of the choices. It's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director because he put that black mark on his CV. Even for the 50s standards, the special effects are disgusting, except for a few submarine sequences. I can only assume that it was nominated for the best special effects, because besides 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THE! There was no one else who made effects. It certainly was not a competition for Disney this year if this was their only competition. I would not recommend the film for die-hard submarine movie fans either, as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to a shot of seawater trickling down the erect periscope. There are other, much better sub-films that you can enjoy from this period, like the 20,000 leagues mentioned above or the Torpedo Run.
