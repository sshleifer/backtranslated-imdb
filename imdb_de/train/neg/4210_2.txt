Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like riding bicycles or climbing into his tree house because he knows what accidents could happen to him. One day he rides his bike and as it starts to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. There the whole story takes place. He experiences all kinds of employees and in the end is not afraid anymore. But the whole story is incredible and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than it is.
