Oh dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and uncomfortable ... Remember the shot of "The Natural", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump), the Roy Hobbs makes a bat out ?? Well, the producers of this movie used the same scene to introduce a scene where a branch rammed into the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use The Natural footage, or did they just hope no one who was watching the movie would pick it up. <br /> <br /> Then in the end, when they tried to get away in the truck. Such overfunction in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad movie, a really bad movie.
