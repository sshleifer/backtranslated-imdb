Children love dinosaurs. It is part of their culture. But they have the land ahead of time. The original. At least this movie had a heart. These. This movie is just pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean you can just fold up any old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid and it's more of the numbers. Not as eager as Theodore Rex, but it's light-years to be a land ahead of time.
