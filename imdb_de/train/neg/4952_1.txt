Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a Batman comic now and then. As you can imagine - I was a bit excited when I heard about this series, and then I was VERY disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY ad. No depth. And what the hell was wrong with the joker? Who, in my humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time and they killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. Actually, I wish I could say that there is something about this series that is remotely creative or interesting. In short (because I think I could say so much more), DO NOT waste your time on this show or on your money.
