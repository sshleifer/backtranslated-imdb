This movie was absolutely ... oh, I can not find the word, oh wait ... crap! I mean, when it started, I was like, that looks good and after that, it was boring. I almost fell asleep and it has nothing to do with the fact that I saw a delayed show because it was totally filth. Ram Gopal Varma did his best, but the cast could never do justice to the cast of the original Sholay. I mean, what he thought of doing a remake. What did he want to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all prizes next year like Black? Ajay and this other guy were good, especially the other one who played Raj because he was the one he had looked at. What did Amitabh do? He destroys his own dignity through all these stupid movies. First Nishabd, then Cheeni Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and now I mean he has to raise some money and get as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect. I mean, all of this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who's getting a really good name because of Amitabh's recent fall. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and I just knew that Abhishek would be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, check out Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie of all time and number one on the charts!
