I have not seen many low-budget movies to admit, but this is probably the worst movie, the lead actor the old man talked to. He had a lobotomy and lost the ability to speak more than a word every 5 seconds; a 5 year old could be better. The story had the most terrible conspiracy, and the army guy probably had what he thought was an army, and then just went over the top, I just looked at it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped It would lead to the right movie. I can not believe it was among the 2-night rental deals at Blockbusters. Please take this for free and take it out of our field of vision. I think there was another halfway decent actor to the woman. I think the only thing that was okay with the budget was the make-up, but they show every important scene of the movie in the beginning of the music. Terrible, just awful.
