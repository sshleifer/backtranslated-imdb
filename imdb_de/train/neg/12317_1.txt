I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slowly, poorly staffed and poorly played, it's a movie that's trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the past few years and fail! McDonald and Parker seem to convey no real feelings and are lifeless. In this case, they seem to be for all the paychecks they get for it, not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! I love great chick movies as well as the next girl and that's not one !! If you avoid a movie this year, let it be
