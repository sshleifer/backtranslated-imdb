The impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films are, as so often, nothing but listless stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story in which men are trained as savage cruel dogs that perform their Lord's bidding. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer compared to an equally unstable police officer, are a far cry from the common heroes and villains we often see. In the end, do you lose track of whom you should empathize with and do not feel the slightest emotion for one of the men? Whether this was the director's failure or perhaps the underlined message he was trying to say is up to you. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, Waypoint became a modest story of survival and revenge. The initially obvious tension soon disappeared due to a mismatched music score that brought the potentially effective storytelling to a standstill. And in the end, you felt that all this detailed background information and the introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, was the transition in the story from point a to point b quite untypical compared to US movies? Those who are unfamiliar with Asian films and the predictability of Hollywood are tired should take a closer look. <br /> <br /> White balance did not seem to be quite the case throughout the movie. It was like looking at a picture that was taken with fluorescence when it was supposed to be tuned to tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it irritated my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie was also fun to play pranks on you? An interesting composition gave me hope for the slow-moving story, until it was diverted into a low-budget, low-speed chase scene. And just when you think you would get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespeare's tragedy, you find that it's not an end at all, but rather a transition to a crazy country music montage about peace and serenity. <Br /> <br /> Cast some gruesome, behind-the-scenes scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought to savagery, and vice versa, Asia's fascination for body fluids and a horrible music score that does not fit the movie , and you get the average thready Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand why every fight scene is overlaid with clips of roaring lions? I thought they should symbolize dogs? In the end, are we ultimately reminded of a true murderer still lurking among us? Tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
