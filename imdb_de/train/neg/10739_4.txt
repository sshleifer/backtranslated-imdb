'Ierere Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a direct video movie. It's the story of a man who thinks his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is done. Everything should be funny, but it is not. It is trivial and awkward, the characters are flat and the end sequence is completely without climax or emotion. The final sequence is probably the only scene in which you feel like laughing, but only about how pitiful the entire lineup is.
