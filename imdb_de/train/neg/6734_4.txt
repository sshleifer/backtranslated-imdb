I found this movie a great idea that did not work. It seems that they have found a way to build up excitement, but they were not able to stage their payouts very well. In one case, the police are on the clock to find the hiding place of the kidnappers. You walk with difficulty from the dentist to the dentist to adjust a dental practice. At the same time the abducted man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the construction, the police arrive at the same time as they are released, which, to say the least, is very anti-climatic. There are also great narrative scenes that take us into the "thinking" of the terrorized husband and wife, distracting from the tension rather than contributing to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult, depriving the viewer of any chance of a personal experience of fear, as Hitchcock has repeatedly proven, is far more effective. The biggest disappointment is to go through the whole movie and reach the fast, rather bland end. I just mean it ... "ends" in a snore.
