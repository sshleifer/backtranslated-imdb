I hate airplane crash movies ... ALL of them! I hate them all with passion! Above all, they look cheap and have no craftsmanship! Second, they insult the aviation industry and tell the audience that all the planes fall down ... fall and crash! <br /> <br /> Why did I flinch in such a movie? This could happen to any of us and with worse consequences than those who suffer from the characters in this film. This is the only deterrent aspect of a disaster yarn for an airline like this one. I hate this movie because, like all 50,000,000 stupid airplane chaos films, it is! Free Fall is like everyone else: nothing but boredom before the cliched bullshit-dramatic scenes take place. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same group of retards in this flying death trap: The Cleaver esquire family, the Yuppie-Baastard and the bitch of a flight attendant with a big blond haircut from 1987 scolded everyone, the least afraid! <br /> <br /> My second point of criticism is that this should not be a full-length movie, but a documentary that describes everything from the Air Canada incident "Gimbli Glider" or "Freefall" to the safety precautions /> <br /> My third and last point of criticism concerns all airline films of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless). Why the hell did the steward tell the passengers to take off their shoes? (I could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but come on!) As if they would make them safer than they are now! If this plane (passengers) did not know better, they knew they would land. Why force 100 injured people into a rubber sheet that can cause the skin to bleed and bleed on impact just to run on a debris field with their trump feet! Is that useful for everyone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and the successful ABC series "Lost" had more depth and realism in the air disaster than just "aircraft glitches" - people turn panicstars into assholes, without wheels In a field, people walk without shoes and Jackets etc. The same old crap from Airport 1975! The freefall was so typical of a plane crash movie that I almost expected Charlton Heston or Peter Graves to burst into the damn passenger cabin. Could we at least see these malfunctioning characters return to normal and not happy between people? who are in the midst of the imminent tragedy staring in front of them? A typical moronic life time movie! Cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director of "Freefall" should focus on cheap TV movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenagers who use drugs and have marital problems. As far as the tension is concerned ... Leave it to the professionals ... you hack! Why should we go through the audience for more than one and a half hours? is airport wannabe rehash. I hope to God that they no longer make airplane crash films. If this is similar to the ABC series "Lost", this would be something to see. But that's absolute crap and then more. Stop turning every airplane disaster movie into "Airport 1975"! This is not an "airport", that is cheaper, pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or a TV movie made for television to anyone, not even my worst enemies.
