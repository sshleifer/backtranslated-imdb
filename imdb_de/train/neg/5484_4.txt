This film is about a family trying to deal with the mother / wife's death by moving to Genova, Italy. <br /> <br /> The storyline of "Genova" sounds promising, but is unfortunately empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes that show the daily life of the family. Swimming, taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are superfluous and tedious, they can not emotionally appeal to the viewer. The end is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can say with certainty that I am disappointed and bored by "Genova". The only good thing about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as an extended tourism promotion for the city, but not as a movie to enjoy.
