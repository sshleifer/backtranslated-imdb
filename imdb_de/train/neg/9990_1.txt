After seeing this movie on the sci-fi channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a number of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless succession of bizarre occurrences or "joys," as the friend reading about my shoulder tells me. The plot is not really worth commenting, but basically a plane crashes with soccer players into the Yeti area. Before the movie is over, we will still expect the hearts to go out, but it waddles to run before jumping 50 meters. He rips off a man's legs and kills him with a Yeti who has survived several bullets and was set on fire without obvious damage, a Yeti dangling from a cliff by clinging to a man's shoe, but then jumps off and a whole series of other bizarre occurrences. Basically you should avoid this movie like the plague if you do not stay awake on a Saturday to watch the worst original movies on the SciFi channel. Or as my friend reads over my shoulder, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." The friend to my right says, "Only Battle Techno music could have done better."
