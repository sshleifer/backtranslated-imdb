I agreed with those comments that said this was a good movie, totally too. This is a totally sucked movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The evolution of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner switched from an innocent girl to a party fun looking for chicks for no convincing reasons. In addition, all the actresses looked too old to be college students - college students looked like they were about 30 years old - you can find out the rest. I only watched for about ten minutes and started searching for sex scenes quickly. All sex scenes are lame, hasty and, above all, not frontal. All sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they had on. Do yourself a favor - lay it down and save yourself a few dollars. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out of 10.
