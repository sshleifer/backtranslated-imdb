I took the chance to watch this movie uncut and uninterrupted, and remembered Rahs and Raves for it. But wherever it seemed really scary, it retreated and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams and the wrong turn in the raw sewage were thrown off before they could start a scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost expressionless face mask produced little but confused unbelief, something I mirrored as the movie progressed. What could have been sinister Aboriginal chants and instruments in the background, instead, was a cacophony that seemed to beat terror in the head. The ideas that modern humans can embody ancient gods, of which Native Americans believe that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other options are passed on as a grocery list rather than as an indication of another dimension (the Dreamtime) br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, I did not realize what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So what? How large? A tsunami? Yes OK. This is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That would have to be a damn big wave. Why? Was the world so bad? It did not seem so terrible in this movie. Actually, I did not think the wave started because the shadow left Burton's face, which had been thrown off the shaft. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Shit, that happens every day to the people who lose it. It would not be of interest if only he were. <br /> <br /> The most scary scene, and the one that shows the best potential for Weirs, was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton went to face the old man because he frightened Burton's wife. Charlie asks him again and again "Who are you?" and it gets really annoying after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed.
