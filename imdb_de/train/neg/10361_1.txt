This ABC TV error is absolutely not fair to the brilliant fantasy novel A Wrinkle in Time. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in their "Time Quartet", is a wonderful account of life, the universe, and time itself. However, it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. His unflinching customs are common throughout the book. This film is nothing more than a ridicule about the artwork of Mrs. L'Engle. Honestly, what did you think? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is muddy and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and almost every magical feature of the novel has been lost. This was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuaron) will one day make another attempt to bring this book to the screen, and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, counterfeit and cheap motel room art that has no floor and absolutely no impact on the audience.
