Yes, I rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise creates an otherwise unpleasant story with no real gain, but at least it's well shot. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with real danger in itself. In most cases, this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker slips away pretty quickly. The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and the writing are just awful. Slower scenes drag on forever and the fear is too low and too far away, without the movie having a real climax. An eerie mood is set at the beginning, but loses its shine before any horror occurs, and I found myself bored to death and made another sandwich ... The cover art is appealing and I think it's worth it if you're looking for it If you want to enjoy a good story and a varied ending, grab something else.
