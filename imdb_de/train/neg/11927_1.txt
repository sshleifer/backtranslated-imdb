Without question the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I've stuck to the end because there's got to be something here, but no. If it is not clichés, the action wanders to the point of nonexistence; Dialogue, which is supposed to be street, is simply messed up; Characters never develop beyond sketches; Set pieces are clichés. Worse, considering his co-director, photography is just so-so. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that highlight this besides Get Carter are Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser far away. The lives of the saints lack their innovation, let alone their depth and shading. In short, her craft. An unscrupulous editor could probably reduce it to a decent 30-minute short, but it's a sixth-generation movie project that's worth one million pounds. walking and bloated with his own claims. That he was financed (certainly only because of Rankin's name) while other small films are fighting for money is depressing for the British film industry.
