This movie is probably a mysterious, heavy thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. After 30 minutes, the movie becomes a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine that no one laughs when Cage happens to kick Karate's blonde girl or when he "beats" that old lady. The lines, characters, and drama are all bad from the start. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made some horrible films this year; This is by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an exciting thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. But if you want to see it, get ready to laugh at a few lines and finish scenes instead of taking them seriously. That's the only way to enjoy this movie.
