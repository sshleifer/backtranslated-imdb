I rented Hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid, lame attempt at a tele-movie. The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when walking it looked like he was eating those mint cakes ... with his butt! The wolf contacts he wore were great, though I felt the actor had relied on them too much because there was nothing threatening about his acting. The wise-born Indian chick must be one of the stoniest hardest ever seen. Talk about an acid cow! She once smiled for the entire movie, and I think that's because she had sex. The sex scene was also lame. You may have also shown curtains if you can dig it out. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is a big pet hate of mine, on the cover and the DVD menu the losers have moved in digitally Cool sharp teeth on the guy. They were nowhere to be seen in the movie. :(
