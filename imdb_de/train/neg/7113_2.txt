THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This film offers some pretty cool biases (an off-screen spokesperson warns that film burglars will be offered a free funeral if they die of fright when they watch this movie.) A scary setting Skull emerging from a quiet room pool and the omnipresent creepy music), but unfortunately the movie is running down from there. A widowed man brings his new bride to his remote mansion ... and admonishes his servants and friends that the new woman has a very fragile inclination due to a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time at all, she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all in her head and ... well, you can probably see where it all leads to. They've found out what's wrong with our unlucky heroine ... because you've probably seen (and do better) the same thing in hundreds of other movies and TV series. To add to the innumerable transgressions of the film, most cuts of this film (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to miss a few key scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly to the window ... she opens up to open it ... you know she'll see something weird ... and then ... all of a sudden, the scene falls into her husband's mind Into the arms. So, what did she see? I think we will never know.
