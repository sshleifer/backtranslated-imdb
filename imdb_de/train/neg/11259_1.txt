I gave this movie 1 I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the great directors of Italian cinema, made such a film, so stupid and ridiculous! All stories of the people involved in the film are unfounded, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola will radically change themes and style in his next film.
