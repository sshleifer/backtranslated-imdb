The First Power (1990) was a terrible movie that came out of cheap-produced horror movies in the late '80s / early' 90s. I found this movie very boring, but in some places extremely funny. This movie has so much sense and credibility that it's not funny at all. The quick justice in this film makes Texas look weak by comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is over the head with this role (he plays a hardened cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a clairvoyant. Do not waste your time with this because it is bad. What a minute, I take it back. This movie makes a great party movie. Look at the nun with the cross-cross package. She has the most beautiful legs I've ever seen with a nun who was not in a Jesus Franco nonstop strip. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This was the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was clouded and he could not draw flies to a dunghill. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, unless you are desperate.
