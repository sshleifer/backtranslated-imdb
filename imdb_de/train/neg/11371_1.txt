The "documentary" and we use that term clearly evident summarizes that Muslims are trying to conquer the world by force. Then it is said that any Muslim who it does not want to admit either his own faith does not know or is lying to your face! Also, has found a market for their ridiculous reality, each person who is interviewed in the film by selling them claptrap of conservatives who are willing to take on other thinking for them. The West must know that this is nothing more than propaganda for spiritual dwarfs. When looking for a documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look around elsewhere. Try something that offers multiple perspectives from qualified sources.
