I have just seen The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than the first time. I do not understand why it has become a "cult classic" when it's so boring. The opening scene looks promising as the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her sweet life. After that, all that really happens is the melting man in some woods and houses, while looking back on his life as an astronaut. The make-up is pretty good and its melting sticky face looks pretty realistic. There's a cool scene where he throws a man's head into a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. However, there is not much to wet, most scenes are shot in the dark and you can not really see what happens. There's not much gore, at least in the Vipco DVD I've seen. <br /> <br /> No, the Incredible Melting Man is not that great. I'll label it for its cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a true sci-fi / horror cult classic, check out The Deadly Spawn instead!
