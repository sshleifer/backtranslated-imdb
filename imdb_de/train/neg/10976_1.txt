A terrible movie that should be independent. It needed some dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This totally lousy film deals with the interactions between Irishmen. Did you try the wonderful movie "Crash?" To imitate? If so, the movie crashed completely. <br /> <br /> Here is just too much going on, culminating in a little brat running around, throwing stones into buses and cars that are obviously causing chaos. > The movie is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another, while her younger sister is demolished by a worshiper. As a result, the former sister becomes a bitter woad and runs around in untrustworthy clothes. The older sister is also embittered, but soon finds a romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry, but there seems to be no punishment for the crooks. Maybe the punishment would have meant the failure of a coherent film.
