THE DECOY is one of those independent productions produced by obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the usual flaws that affect most of these films. It has a definite story, it has a decent spectacle, the photography is very good, the hero and the villain are both impressive men and the background music is not over the top. This is a DVD reissue, so people will be looking to see if it's worth it. I do not know where the ten come from, because by no means can this movie be so good - even if you are the mother of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a theater was Warner's garbage collection from J K. Rawlings' popular and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. When comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, keep in mind that PHOENIX (like Warners) had no history. The director did not allow acting, the photography was awful, and the sound-of-sound music was a mess. I rated Phoenix "1" because the scale did not go down. THE DECOY is four times better in every way. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - the shootout" or any other nonsense. It is original. If your expectations are not surpassed by the stupid "10", you may enjoy the movie on its own terms.
