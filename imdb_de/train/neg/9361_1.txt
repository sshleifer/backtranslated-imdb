When I saw the preview for this on TV, I thought, "Okay, it will be a good werewolf movie," but it was not like that. it was not scary at all! Acting was good, the conspiracy was terrible, the military mission was stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could have been better than this piece of crap. The film sounded like Arron was turning into a werewolf, instead becoming psycho and biting a doctor's neck. If you've read some of my other reviews in other films, they're all positive, but that's not just because the story was awful. One of 10 max. I'm sure you all expected a waswolff movie, but I bet you did not expect that. Beyond Loch Nes it was a lot better than this movie, dammit, every movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
