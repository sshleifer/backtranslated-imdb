This movie is so horrible that it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At first the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded person can write a better story! The actors are boring and untalented, maybe they were forced to play in this cheesy movie. <br /> <br /> The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good thing in this movie. I should be ashamed because I paid for this lousy picture. <br /> <br /> Hopefully nobody will do a sequel or a similar movie with such a bad plot :-)
