This movie has always impressed me. I saw it as a freshman in high school and was home alone this night. I think I lost the respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of Brady Bunch. I also thought that the role of Chuck Connor is abominable and evil. However, this film has impressed me so much that I am now volunteering at the Women's Women's Prison, conducting Bible studies and worship, and trying to change women's lives one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people actually saw this movie. No one of my friends saw it and my family is unaware until today when I discuss this movie because they did not see it.
