My comment refers to the Russian version of the Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space), which will be shown on the first channel of Russia on April 10th and 13th, 2006. A bad translation could have ruined some details, but I doubt that this is the case. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (development of the first rockets). Even the US half of the movie contains several mistakes and omissions. The audience will not be told about launches of V-2 / A-4 from the US. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number "UE" on board. Apollo 1 should be brought to the moon, etc. In the Russian half, everyone is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniform and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song waiting for the start (I think it was added specifically for the Russian version).
