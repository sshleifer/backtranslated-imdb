Spoiler: A group of passive-aggressive people who have a family reunion. The script tells them that they are doing and doing things that people would never do, at least anyone who has a bit of decency. The hero falls in love with a woman whom he sees as his soulmate in a bookstore on the day of reunification, unaware that she will appear as a friend of his brother at reunification. He tries to resist his brother's request, but she knows that our hero has a definite crush on her. At one point she actually undresses and takes a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart breaks. She finds it funny, until she suddenly decides that she does not want the brother and leaves the reunion. <br /> <br /> The film is really catching up. The audience coughed and fidgeted over the long haul. The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. We almost went out, but we kept thinking that something would happen that would cheer things up, but no. All the nice reviews must have been written by paid shillers to make poor fools like me see crap like this. Compare it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? My goodness shame on you, the writers, the actors, the producers and the theaters, because they let something so bad on the screen!
