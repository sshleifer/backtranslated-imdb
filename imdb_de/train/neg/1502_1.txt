The ballad of Django is a dormant mess of a movie! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) Movies allegedly linked by "Django" and tells how he brought in various outlaws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) does not play the role of Django. Skip this one if you do not just have to make every django movie and THIS might not be a good excuse to watch this movie !!
