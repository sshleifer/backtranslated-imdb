Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... honey "protector," whatever that means), descended from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had received an indication of the whereabouts of a vast treasure that our Founding Fathers, most if not all Masons, had chosen to hide because they did not want to finance their independence too badly. <br /> The first clue shows in a ship long lost in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and some faceless lackeys, arrive in the hold of the ship. They immediately spill tons of gunpowder across the floor, not that it matters in any way. At last they find the clue (a skeleton hovers over it) and it turns out that it's a whistle that's written on. Type of. Do not ask me to explain that. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery, and despite the fact that his expedition is obviously upset because he does not find the actual treasure, Gates wanders around wailing to himself on the meaning of the puzzle. in this frozen hold, while the crew only stands around with their jaws open. I mean, come on. Someone should have been a little vociferous in his disappointment to come all the way to the damn Arctic and find nothing interesting, but they just stand there as Gates enters his own world and solves the mystery. The next clue is the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is horrified. Different characters provide a very obvious representation (get used to it). All this leads to Ian's lackey pulling a gun at Gates and gunpowder exploding in a big explosion. Huh !!) Ian and his followers flee, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley run to temperatures below zero in an Inuit village to stop them. <br /> To stop her, Gates closes after trying FBI and super-archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Gates and Riley have to steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates in painful detail why they can not steal the declaration because it protects them with metal and laser eyes and high-tech security. Gates then tells Riley that there is a way to steal it from the storage room. Does Riley know what the storage room is, asks Gates? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not joking; that is the real line. Bartha does not deliver it like a joke either. So Riley researches all this research into the Library of Congress and the archives and about water and sewage, but they do not know what the Preservation Room is. This pretty much indicates what level this script is at. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this document short, Gates actually does with the D of I on a ridiculous burglary that can only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they portray computer monitor technology in movies - full of unlikely and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase lands for convenience and as an obvious "love interest." At one point, while fleeing from the law, the three discuss their plans very loudly in a clothing store surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father Played by a dyspeptic Jon Voight leads good and bad guys to a huge Indiana Jones funhouse under New York City. Strange that the subway builders have never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian on a wild chase. Ian thinks they are caught in a dead end and leaves them there. After they leave, Riley asks how they should come out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... pushes a button and a door opens. No I'm serious. A button as it is available on a dishwasher room in an office building. Good that he knew where that was. Anyway, after a few tricky twists, they find this huge treasure room (remember, this is all under Manhattan!) Full of all sorts of historical, golden things. Riley can deliver a really stupid line. Once again. FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and marries the two chemical-free leads. <br /> <br /> For every viewer, I find it hard to ignore all explanations and jumps of logic and stereotypical characters for a very long time. Some exposures also include beautiful history lessons that are randomly inserted into a conversation. I would like to have more conversations in my life.
