I've always thought Cinderella II is the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; Since the film has no action, they try to fill it with joke. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it 1/10. But now I think about it, most children are not interested in how good the original movie was, they just care about making the movie entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's awful. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
