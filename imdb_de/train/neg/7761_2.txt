After a series of power outages in a remote island zoo, genetically engineered Saber toothed tigers are on the loose and gruff inhabitants of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made a few bad "original" movies, but I think this may be the worst yet! This poorly written and directed rip-off "Jurassic Park" offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientists who think that people killed by monsters are "unnecessary losses", characters walking alone through dark corridors, brain-dead youthful characters who only work the movie should die a horrible death, etc.), and it is not surprising that there is no tension at all. The special effects are cruel - the dollheads in close-ups of the title beasties are bad enough and look like stiff plush dolls, but the CGI - which makes the computer-generated dinosaurs come alive in "Walking with Dinosaurs" in comparison, they are just terrible. There's a bit of gore, but most of it does not look very convincing. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist in the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh, it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this one is just bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting little things for you - this movie has taken notes from the 2003 science fiction film Alien Hunter, which was far superior to this bitch.
