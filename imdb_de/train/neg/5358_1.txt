It is obvious that all the good reviews that have been published for this film to date come from insiders who either participated in the film or know someone who knows someone and has therefore seen several cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's pure rubbish. The only thing it has to offer is ambition and several cameos from horror legends (none on screen for a terribly long time). It's as if the filmmakers filmed this movie during a weekend horror convention, and made actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess, and Michael Berryman film scenes during their coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap, would-be shot X-Files with terrible plays from a group of non-actors with more than 21st century mullies acceptable. There is little or no action; It is all a dialogue to be explained, trying to explain a meaningless intricate plot. The computer FX are a joke, but there is not enough of it and not enough action to make this movie enjoyable in MST3K mode. After about 8 scenes of nothing more than talking, grab the fast-forward button ... and do not let go. Absolutely worthless.
