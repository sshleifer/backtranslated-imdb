I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the film is that in some places you think a little bit about the spiritual theme, the evolution, the sinfulness and your part of the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the movie is easily broken and there are very few relationships between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this movie version. The events that were supposed to be a symphony are almost unrecognizable. There are a number of considerations that must be made so that the viewer can see that the scene is a coincidence, and even more to believe that this has something to do with a bigger purpose. <br /> <br /> Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not produce the better feeling than it should. Do you remember the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, that's not true. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are performed poorly. There are many scenes that do not really develop the story, nor do they contribute to creating an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not save it. The first two seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters trying to save the movie, and because they paid more, but that does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells himself as a vicious guy (as always), but the script does not help him all. The scene in which he first tries to persuade John (Matthew Settle) to join him is a bad script. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad. The flashbacks throughout the movie can not even be commented on. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a great span of time, read the book! I did not read it, but it's probably a billion times better than that, it has to be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
