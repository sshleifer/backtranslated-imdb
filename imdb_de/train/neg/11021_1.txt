Hallam Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and then experiences a kind of Oedepus complex. <br /> <br /> It's about 95 minutes, but in ten it would be better. There is about an hour in the middle where he makes climbing exercises on roofs, and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). I have nothing to do with anything. She looks like his mother, yes, what? We know he misses his mother, that's what it was all about for the first ten minutes. They just had to put the beginning and the end together, and it would have been OK. Short film. Now it is a portrait of a figure that does not change. He's a guy who happens to do that. The only active choice he has throughout the middle of the film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There is this whole thing of Oedepus, which is supposed to get us to analyze his character. He paints his face, dresses in women's clothes and carries a dead badger on his head. A badger You have to see the end! He returns home with the badger on his head (and he is filmed like a melancholy horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he initially had sex). And somehow they thought that would not be entertaining enough, so they put indie-punk music in the background. I have to admit, I'm kind of allergic to movies that want to write a psychological complex on my nose. It feels like this MacKenzie director / guy / whatever is trying to show he's also been studying psychology at school. You're so smart! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! You really dug! What a wallraff! Okay, now I realized that this movie is based on some random book, but still. <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. Many talking heads. In addition, the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene. You know, cold and warm, etc. Why? Maybe "Hallam Foe" is both a feature and a test movie for color-blind people. Or maybe they just thought the drama would not be enough to tell us he was feeling lonely, and so they turned blue, so we really understand. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the cliché in the oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they made in the presentation. And all the "sweet" sex stuff. This whole movie is an independent cliché. But I can only recommend it. I have laughed more than a few times. Although it's really annoying to be a film student and see how crap goes through the machine.
