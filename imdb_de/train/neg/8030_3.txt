Not really keen on it. The story is pretty awful and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, well, bill nunns. After that it was pretty awful. Tim does not fit into the role, he looks like a smug, inflated ass & Pruitt Taylor Vince does not convince as a trumpeter. It's an idealistic movie and as a musician you feel slightly offended after watching it. There are no scenes in which 1900 was played or played with his colleagues, he is completely lenient. I find it difficult to build a relationship with this type of character, maybe I see the wrong movie. If you have no real passion for life or a sense of what music is all about, then happily treat yourself to the suspension of unbelief and watch this waffle.
