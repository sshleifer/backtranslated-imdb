The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology - similar to Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated lovers of the series who think that every episode was a winner, regardless of whether or not each episode was a winner. It is they who can rate each show with a 10 and can not rate the show objectively. That's why I checked all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) some time ago because the ratings and ratings were too positive overall. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Even though I've made many episodes 10, this one gets 3 just because it was bad. The letter was really bad. You see two people who are in a big war from another side as they wander through the entire episode. After a while, it's obvious that these are the only two people left on Earth - as you'll learn in the really stupid and absolutely unconvincing conclusion. Normally, the turn makes the episode a great one - it killed them!
