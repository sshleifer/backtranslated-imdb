Why is this show so popular? I do not like why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried to look at it more than once, and I can not make it terrible through an entire episode. Everyone exaggerates to the point where it's annoying to watch. They speak unnatural voices, use unnatural sounds and have an unnatural body language. I have seen better acting in a kindergarten school. <br /> <br /> On the other hand it is NOT FUNNY. The actions are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or FUNNY. Should not a sitcom be funny? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventies here? It's about as authentic in the seventies as "Happy Days" in the fifties. <br /> <br /> OH and what about Ashton Kutcher? Who did this untalented Dweeb? And now he makes films? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is quality television, it worries me.
