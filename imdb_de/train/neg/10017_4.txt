"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to take place in an immaculate underworld, a time long past when the biggest sin a child could commit was to resist the law and get a ticket. It starts with a young car fanatic who gets the business from her archrival who forces her to a car race. That's it in drag racing. This B-Flick is mainly about rock'n'roll, man! The people of American International were obviously decent, right-angled teenagers who liked to party but still did not participate in an adult chaperone. There are a few amusing double starters and fruity exchanges ("Necking Kid:" We thought we could get some fresh air "... Dad:" Where do you think you would find it in her throat? "), But the ghost comes a little late. Short on 65 minutes, the movie cheats us off with a climactic race that actually takes place off screen, and a "Scooby Doo" style unmasking that makes no sense. For nostalgia fans, however, there are some pointless fun. ** from ****
