Aside from the acting of Meryl Streep, which as always is remarkable, I would avoid this movie because it has an outdated "movie of the week" quality. But it's worth watching as you look at the various sub-stories: how a couple goes through the media review and how the differences are treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the credibility of the differences is important. Australians are different than "we" (most of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come across with a "strange" flair about it. The couple involved are religious (unlike most others) and Adventists (different). Their lifestyle and their way of thinking are therefore suspicious at first. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so we are confronted with strange questions again. The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treat others, those who have different accents and beliefs than we do, and how we regard what they say as suspicious. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are sad posts on the web all over it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie, it was discovered (as you'll find on the web search) that much larger kids were being chased by dingoes. Research by dingos experts has shown that it was not only possible but most likely that the baby was taken by dingos (possibly a couple), expertly pulled out of clothing and eaten within moments without any trace. <br /> <br /> But the question remains why people defended dingoes when they endangered children, instead of killing the dingo to save the children, why, because a woman's affect (expression) is so cold that she is guilty, and on and on. <br /> <br /> Spooky questions, with or without a movie.
