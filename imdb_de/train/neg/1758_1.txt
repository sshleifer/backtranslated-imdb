If you have not seen it yet, I'll just say go for a walk in the park and do not waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the spectacle is worth your money. * Spoiler * - I can not decide what was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very questionable. I hope she can improve it over time. The story is just amazing. Loose cannon American policeman who fights criminals in Europe on his own? Infamous Slavic Mafiosi only protected by two guys ??? An emotional art teacher who runs a reckless gang ??? Spanish police chief stupider than a bag of hammers ??? Give me a break. However, there is only one good thing in this film: at least the cost of production must be lower than "Ocean's 12", which was as meaningless and exaggerated as this one.
