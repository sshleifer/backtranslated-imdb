This film is about a young scientist developing a serum that revives the dead. He first uses it with his brother when he is shot dead on a pass. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some scenes, the zombies are seen running very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast, which makes little sense. Acting is mediocre, but history does not help the movie. The makeup consists of blood in the face of the zombies. I'm sure the budget for this movie was very limited. I think the film could have been made better if the story were more original and had a better budget. If you want to see a good zombie strip, you will not see it.
