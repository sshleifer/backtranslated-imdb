This nasty video was initially banned in the UK and allowed without cuts last November. <br /> <br /> It shows the Playboy Playmate of the month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and misty jungle pictures. I'm not sure what the purpose was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the ransom in the jungle. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively while another (Werner Pochath) is constantly complaining. <br /> <br /> The ransom change goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have eaten? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a bad video? Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortable undressed. Peter leaves her and goes off alone to find Laura, who has since been captured. They spend their time having sex and see no danger. Courage, someone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some big wounds from the Cannibal Priestess (Aline Mess) and the line "They ripped their hearts out", which is funny when you see the movie.
