The action was fine. Akshay Kumar was as always good and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so much pain and screaming about her size zero, but she did not look slimmer. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor played such a bad role. There was not much to do in the movie for him. Just because it's a Yashraj movie does not mean that an actor should take on the role no matter how bad. Ali Khan was fine. I think it's high time that Indian directors and producers start looking at Indian customers as an intelligent lot. What are we ? Fools !!!! What they think, they will show two men taking a SWAT squad against seesaws, and we'll believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they try to catch some criminals ... They take a whole troop of more than 100 police officers and nobody surrounds the palace. The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action. Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen who were all shooting at him ... and he shot back at her. None of the policeman's bullets touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Crap CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the fight director who was thinking about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to watch this movie.
