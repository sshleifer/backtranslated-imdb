This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive at the time. A wealthy English upper-class woman plans, manipulates, and manipulates everyone around her to her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to conduct secret activities of an extremely unsocial nature. There is a clever reversal of the gender role as their activities make them more daring and simple than most male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger who can sustain the love interest, and that evil lady is not backward when she meets the right man. Every other character does not convict the action in the extreme, but those who crave romance , are overlooked.
