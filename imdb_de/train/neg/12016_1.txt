If Bob Ludlum saw this miniseries, he would have cried. That was a waste of time and money. I've read the book, and although films are not exactly what the book is, CBS wastes time and money, and it's embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> Maybe the creator should be Look at the Bourne identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good this TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to break this low? <br /> <br /> Terrible !!
