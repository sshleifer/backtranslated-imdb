Black-and-white film. Good photography. Credible characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I wasted another perfect evening and watched a movie rated "worthy" and "very good" by others. There is a good acting and the background for the plot is good (more should have been done with it), but it is growing very slowly and never develops. It is based entirely on sex without much romance and with much unnecessary nudity. You could have done more with the main characters. If you're looking for something to look at with your family, this is not the movie, and if you do not, you'll have trouble getting through it. Although this film is long, it is only about 1 inch deep!
