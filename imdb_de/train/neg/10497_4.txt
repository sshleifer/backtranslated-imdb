So, Steve Irwin. One must admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that is clearly filled with crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tons of manure of the above reptiles and mud, not only daily but also with enthusiasm. He was never able to make me want to, but he managed to get his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This film does not fall into my parallel film university - the films for people who have just had their teeth drilled, have migraines or have no movie experience and are therefore like meager mediocrity (currently well populated with Disney movies ). It's too loud. Well, Steve is too loud. He's just so happy all the time and would blow the teenage boy teenager (I can hear it now: "This movie was so stupid") or cut Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm is infectious, but if it did I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they were beauties, but I still will not stroke them. Plot was indeed predictable. The bad guys were so bad that for a minute I thought I was shopping in an electronic supermarket. But the movie was full of animals and Steve and Terri, so I looked at it. This conspiracy (if you could call it that) was actually more a reason to throw a crocodile into a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. <br /> <br /> However, I had hoped that there would be a sequel where Steve and Terri (who have been working on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can not believe that we will not see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved at least in the Australian Zoo and the Discovery Channel. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without a member of the Irwin family telling me how wonderful this crocodile is. Crikey!
