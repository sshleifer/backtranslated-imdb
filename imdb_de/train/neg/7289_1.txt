This is a movie of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not a part). I saw a preview of this movie and did not know what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional (often downright "twisted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my thing. An epic saga like this should give your viewers something more in the end. Ultimately, images like this are about the human condition - this image hardly sheds new light on its meaningful facets.
