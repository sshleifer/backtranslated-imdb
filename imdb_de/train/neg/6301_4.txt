Despite the great work of the supporting actors and an intelligent screenplay by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a deadly mistake - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as "a wistful little crap," and unfortunately that perfectly brings it to the point. There is nothing about him or his accomplishments to make it credible that his girlfriend and the publisher / friend of the upper class would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and utterly annoying. The part called for an actor who can make you love him, even if he's a prate - like an Ewan McGregor. <br /> <br /> The witty satire in the class system etc. was wasted thanks to this irritating and utterly unlikely performance. All I wanted was to shake him and tell him to get over himself.
