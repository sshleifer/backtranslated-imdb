This movie was another waste of time ... why, why am I letting so much crap? ... Someone please tell me ... * sigh * All right. Back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you've really enjoyed the first movie (like I did) and just want to find out what's in the last (hopefully) scraped-together movie, just to keep some actors and poor Scriptwriters hired, then of course this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic storyline ... * bad grin *, then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK, I'm lying ... Best of all, this movie is shit , OK, I have to admit that certain elements were cool to that .. well .. cool ... and I laughed a lot, a lot about the wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But all in all, the few things that make up the category "ok" are not enough to make this movie worth anything. Unless one counts "Manos - Hand of Fate" among the top ten films of all time!
