Nothing can prepare you for another lousy Bimbo trip! This time it is brought to you by the never anticipated Fred Olen Ray! As far as commercials go, this does not click! As science fiction, it's just unoriginal! All we see is an ugly, female android wearing a bikini to destroy the earth, showing off everything that is almost irresistible! Give me a short break !!! If this type of entertainment is your thing, why not dust off the old SI bathing suit magazines for a change from the attic ?! That would have been much better if the sleaze factor had not been set to a very high value, but that would not make it great. I would like to refer to another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It shows why first-class "femme fatale" first-person action films in America are not translated well. Sorry, people!
