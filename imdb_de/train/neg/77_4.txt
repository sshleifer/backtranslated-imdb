I watched this movie opening weekend in Australia and, with a stellar cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, expected the final story of Ned Kelly to evolve before me. Unfortunately, the plot was paperless despite a stellar performance by Heath Ledger ... which did not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were a few other pluses, in particular the support of Edgerton, who guaranteed the direction of Jordan (as confirmed by his talent in Buffalo Soldiers) and the production design that gives the Australian bush a real sense of harshness, just like the Irish immigrant of the early days 19th century must have seen it. But I can not help but feel that another opportunity has been missed to tell (or was it?) The real story of an Australian folk hero. I suspect that there is a concession to Hollywood and the sale of the image in the US. Well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose beards just to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> I guess I just have to deal with Peter Carey's excellent "Secret History of the Kelly "content gang." 4/10
