If ever another Hitler shows up, it will be partly due to a nonsense like this movie, which spreads the absurd notion that he was a visibly confused madman from the start. Far from following such a person and choosing him as the highest office in the land, reasonable people crossed the street to avoid him, and he died in a ditch, nameless and unknown. <br /> <br /> Whoever reads the reports of Hitler's close associate - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge - is impressed by the fact that people found him a friendly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speeches were overworking and listening to modern ears ignores the times when they were made, as swirling pomposity was common in political speeches. Likewise, the exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central element of the early Nazis - especially anticommunist - was still unusual or unusual for the time. The film makes it look as if Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person that will cause the deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore spotty Raver life depicted here. Instead, look for a charming, charismatic man whose convincing speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for a lot here and got nothing but caricature. The fools who did this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
