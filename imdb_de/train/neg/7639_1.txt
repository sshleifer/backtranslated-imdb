I saw this movie at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. First and most distracting was how much of it was shot; That is, a lot of slow-motions and overly-artistic close-ups that seemingly did not make sense - in terms of story or aesthetics - except that they show the cinematographer's abilities (which in my opinion was also the director). This film seemed to be what a presumptuous film student would bring with it. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very sweet, but at best a mediocre actor; and the rest of the cast ranged from bad to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most viewers seemed to enjoy the movie; I laughed and sighed constantly, but I did not like it very much.
