As with Freddy's Revenge, this sequel has a rather strange idea and does not make much of an effort to get a story out of it. Basically, Alice is number 4 pregnant and her baby is being followed by Freddy, which gives him the opportunity to persecute her friends. This has the fewest deaths from the entire series and the white cracks are pretty bad, so neither the horror fans nor the comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about that. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan return from four, but it's not worth watching a movie. Relentless and not enjoyable, perhaps only the direction of the competitor saves them from being the worst of the series.
