This film was so poorly written, staged and played that it rejects the faith. It should be recreated with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is acting. They have on the one hand Jennifer Beals, who is polished, professional and absolutely believable, and on the other hand Ri'chard, who is wistfully suspicious and just makes fun of this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just terrible because the slave owns (and keeps) a pair, although both usually do a good job. The actors (and the director) should not have tried to set any accents - they are inconsistent and unbelievable. It's much better to have focused on doing good work in proper English. The casting is ridiculous. Why did the children of an "African" trader (who is less socially desirable for the Gens de Couleur society) be occupied by very pale, undressed actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel has expressed African features, including an obviously tinted blonde "her"? It's as if the casting directors can not bother to read the script they throw, and select suitable actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse color actors. It's just so funny! This could be a great movie and should be recreated, but with people who can respect the material and select suitable and capable actors. There are many good actors and it would be fun to see Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben getting on with a decent cast, a good script and a good direction.
