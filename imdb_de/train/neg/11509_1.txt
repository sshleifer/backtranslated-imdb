I do not know what some of you smoke, but I suspect it's strong. Calling Swept Away terrible would be an insult to the concept of awfulness. Acting is abominable and I do not select Madonna here, we all know she is useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her disease is contagious. My back literally hurts because I bended so much on poorly supplied lines. The editing is so sloppy, there is no description. The photography and composition (in this time should be given competence for any film on a budget) are surprisingly unsuitable, even if the lighting looks terrible and unnatural. These are basic elements of filmmaking. If you can not get it right, you should look for another line. It is designed like a 3rd production of Snow White, except by far not so well made or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor that excels at presenting stunning visuals - you can taste the sea salt and feel the wind-blown sand in your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate ... those of you who found Guy Ritchie's version regrettable should see it, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema. Those of you who thought the remake is a kind of masterpiece that should have your minds examined.
