Oh man. good cast, but writing and governing is an art, and writing joke and direct joke is a bit of a job. Even if you make a good comedy, you have to set the right timing and the right moment. I do not put it all down, there were parts that made me laugh aloud, but that was very rare. The main focus for me was on the fast, free-flowing dialogue that annoys some people in the movie. It may sound great if you read the script in your head, but taking it out and into the camera is another task. And the handheld camera work gives energy to some parts of the movie. The overall direction was good, but the script was not all for me, but I'm sure you've read the script in your head. It would sound good. We are sorry.
