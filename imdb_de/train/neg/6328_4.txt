Why is this film falling short of the standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humorless screenplay. A slender / average-looking Travolta (I must say, he looked pretty chic even with a GIANT mullet) and Gross are both very good as two young-dressed but skilful New Yorkers who want to open their own nightclub. Apart from that, the rest of the movie is just boring to look at. It's SO SO boring that it's really not worth knowing what's going on at every level of the movie's climax. Kelly Preston apparently exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her future husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the movie. Charles Martin Smith is pretty funny to see, like the fighting KGB "Bob Smith". I personally think the movie would have been better if the storyline had been changed a bit so that the attitudes did not change from New York to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand you see the movie ... Obviously, this movie was shot in 1986 for a 1987 release. I think Paramount stayed until January 1989 because of the incredible conspiracy. It was reported that they considered it "unsolvable". Even so, this $ 6,000,000 movie was worth a whopping $ 163,000, as it was released in BRIEFLY in countries like Texas and Colorado before playing directly on video. This is proof of the overall poor quality of this film.
