How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat did it. That's a shit and he likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those films that I need to warn people about. It is an abominable atrocity caused by vomiting, which only asks to be seen, so that you can feel so much worse. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors. <br /> <br /> For a movie about Heavy Metal he certainly does not seem to understand what Heavy Metal is or what it is. This movie manages to paralyze the heavy metal look and that was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. That's quite a performance, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = so bad you'll be annoyed that you saw it. This simple equation hopefully keeps you away from this mindless and discouraged film.
