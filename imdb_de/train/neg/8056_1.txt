A clumsy, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which the student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claimed the life of her friend Sean (Casey Affleck). > I can not tell you how bad that is ... nothing of any importance ever occurs, or is there any real entertainment value at all. I did not like this cast in this movie - they are all unconvincing (their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the anxiety? There is no sense or tension - there are some good songs, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> How on earth did this project get the green light? Author-director Steve Carpenter has no recognizable visions or talents that I can perceive. Worst of all, the inference makes the whole movie really pointless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut" I saw is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
