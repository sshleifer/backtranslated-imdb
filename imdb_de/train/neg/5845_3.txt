Well, after seeing this, I can say that this is not the worst movie ever made. Yes, there are worse things than that. There are some good points for the movie. You can see drunken teenagers, have terrible deaths. and cute-looking rats eating some science experiments and getting grotesquely tall, the drunken janitor, the witty doctor, and yes, a girl in thong's underwear who has absolutely no shame, stupid jocks I personally could not wait for the rat to do to eat these drunken fools, I rooted all the time for the rat, she had a good condition, the first part of the movie, was interesting, although the scientific explanations about the rats, and the little backstory, but I think that it was ruined when the stupid, drunken, horny teenagers come into play, the rat in my opinion, the one who lost, her name is Brenda, was so fake, must have been a cGi rat, looked like a man in one Biberanzug, that was pretty fluffy, lame, but not totally disgusting
