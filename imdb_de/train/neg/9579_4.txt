Here is a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (you wish!) With Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF LIVING DEAD 3). Clarke as Candy, a desert person who leaves a bank robbery with his friend Johnny (Jason Durr) behind. He lands in a south of the border prison, which is led by the sadistic Chief Screw (a overreacting Robert Englund in a Toupet). She and her beloved pet poodles hide in the convent of a gas station until they are transformed by a newly fallen meteorite. The dogs turn into sickening drag queen bitches and Candy develops a VERY long-termed, killing forked tongue that she can not control. Rackets looking for the stolen loot and other fake skulls add complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is awesome and does what's made of this movie. You watch her and see someone who is very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and costumes, including a stunning, crunchy latex body ... and wonder how this actress not a huge star comes. It is too bad that the rest of this cult attempt does not live up to its promise. <br /> <br /> School Principal / Scribe Sciamma, who thinks the fancy premise is just enough for a laugh ... but his vulgar gags annoying minor characters and stupid dialogues are no substitute for real humor. Another nail in the coffin; The film looks cheap, many bright colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert landscapes. Thankfully for Sciamma, Clarke is in his movie because she's watching you alone.
