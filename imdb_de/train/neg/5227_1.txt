........ and an extremely bad !!! How long has this train accident lasted? 14 episodes or something? I can understand why now. <br /> <br /> I bought the "Serenity" episode of Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it's free. That is the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident?). <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on the acting, as these were fairly new people who did not really get the job. At least I have never seen her in a big show, in the theater or on TV. If so, then I easily forgot it. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrible. This is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did a better job than that, and that was thirteen years ago. I especially laughed at the bad guys' ship (reaper or similar) as it chased the weird-looking firefly, and smoke came out of the engines that looked like a giant model rocket. I had absolutely expected to see the Wiley Coyote at the summit while chasing the Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines do not even do that badly. <br /> <br /> And that was not even the worst. In Wild West shootings, I wondered if I actually saw a science fiction movie or a Gene Autry movie. Regardless of the hype, do not waste your time ... I did ... every 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
