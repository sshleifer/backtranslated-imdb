I could not believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I had a good laugh since playing half my life D & D. I had to turn it off because I had company, and they wondered what crap I had looked at. <br /> <br /> Finished it later, and I should have just let Softcore gay clown pornography get started. No, they perform the palette of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism and dressing as KKK ... This movie is absolutely mean for anyone who has ever played D & D. The Real D & D would not let them they use their game. Who wants her name to be related?
