His costume drama is poorly staffed and without charm. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was a great character actor. But he is utterly implausible as a leader, an 18th century villain known for his philosophy and good looks. His Costar is just Akim Tamiroff. A Frenchman! Then there is Signe Hasso in a dark wig as the virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis is best. The movie starts with her in silhouette. She is a soubrette and a naughty girl. She disappears for a while, but appears in an unlikely situation. But she is good. She has always been an attractive actress. Here she is closest to her usual kind of role. <br /> <br /> It should be a bit cheeky, a kind of ooh-la-la. It should have a light touch, but it is a leaden matter from start to finish.
