I can not remember going out of a movie theater once. Not only that, I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, figures made of clay, violence without meaning. I did not care when the good ones died; I did not care when the bad guys got it. The fantasy and magic was thick as liver pudding applied and there was no connection. In short, good entertainment if you spend an eternity in hell.
