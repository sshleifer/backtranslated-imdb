No scenario, bad actors (the poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give it a budget ... In Belgium we produce ten films that win all prices in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director has graduated or a police officer? <br /> <br /> The better things in this movie were the word "end". , <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell this? 1รง is too expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, this was my big mistake of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time I'll break my arm, but buy that kind of sh * t.
