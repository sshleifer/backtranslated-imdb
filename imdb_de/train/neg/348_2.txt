This movie is a shitty and memorable vehicle by Sean Connery. The performances are generally shitty, especially by Capshaw, Fishburne and the normally solid Ed Harris. Connery seems to be a Harvard graduate. The movie will definitely get worse. It is a third-rate puzzle that is extremely invented at the time it unfolds. The movie is an outstanding minor cast. George Plimpton also plays a minor role in adding some gravitas to Connery in the debate on the death penalty. The violence and the atmosphere cultivate a third-rate mystery / thriller that manipulates to the highest degree. The scripting and the direction are extremely bad. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the only virtues of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
