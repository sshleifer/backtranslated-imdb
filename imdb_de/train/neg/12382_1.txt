Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would turn in their graves if they knew that suppose who is coming to dinner is actually in the cinema. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. Today's rip-off is a joke. So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (insert GASP here) to his grandfather's funeral. Of course, the reactions of his family members were predictable. This film was telegraphed so painfully from beginning to end that my friend actually started snoring to signal that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Make a pass on Wake.
