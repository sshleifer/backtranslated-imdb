I loved the first season. The quality went back a little in the second season, but had a great center (Pegasus!). The third season was pretty new and original and was fine. The fourth season went downhill quickly, because she gave us no explanations when we really needed them now. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon fractions? What was the point where Angel-Kara led the fleet to a ruined Earth-1? What past did the last five Cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our earth) in the past. Well. But destroy the fleet ?! Give up technology, give up any kind of city life and spread a few thousand people all over the planet ?! It's not just anti-science, it's anti-rational and life. The philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle that leads from the nature romance to a decadent capitalist society, the destructive A.I. that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a greater future for humanity, and it contradicts the right science fiction. And do not even bring me up with the angels! Religious swatter of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment !! <br /> <br /> The whole "all this has happened before and will happen again" should refer to the previous incarnation of the series, not just the earth as we know it. To reconcile the new show with the old one would have been the decisive stroke of genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
