I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (since this movie was touted), but it failed me miserably. For me, the conspiracy was a bit confusing, and I quickly lost interest. I am so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff that they are interested in this movie. I will remain a fan of all, but only time can cure my feeling for this feeling. I can positively comment on the movie that Hillary Yonica played so well that I did not even recognize Hillary. I needed a few scenes to realize it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box. Had I paid to see it on the big screen, I would be crazy!
