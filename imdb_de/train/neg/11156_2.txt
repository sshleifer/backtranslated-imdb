Dark Wolf Let's get straight to the point: this is a disgusting piece of rotting roadkill with a cow on it. It's just a horrible movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst performances imaginable and a story as weak as any other nerd from a 1980s drama movie. Worse, poor Kane Hodder was tempted to play the gigantic evil werewolf. Kane fucks Hodder. Someone is trying to make sure that Jason Voorhees is at the height of his film career ... Anyway, former playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and eventually becomes a werewolf. It's a kind of shitty cop drama with the worst werewolf in the world. But it has moments of almost wild nudity. But that's all. Would you like to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur that wafts around the screen. And if we're privileged enough to actually see a transformational sequence, we'll be presented with something akin to a full-motion video game video created at the beginning of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really so primitive. Only good for horror hardcore fanatics who want to see little moments of nudity, surrounded by brisk vomit. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
