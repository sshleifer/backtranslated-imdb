This movie is really mean. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s / 80s and places it in a school context. I'm not saying that crime in the city was not a problem for many people, or that schools were not problem areas, but this vile piece of exploitation needs the cookie. Violence is something that is realistically unimaginable. However, in this case, it's not about social issues, but about a white middle-class student who makes himself the criminal kingpin of his local high school student. And of course he knows how to play the system. Does that sound familiar? Yes. This shit is pure violent exploitation, a really unpleasant job. It is disturbing brutality as a social commentary. This belongs in the same category as garbage like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so forth. The only notable thing is that Michael Fox was so bankrupt back then that he had to do something like that.
