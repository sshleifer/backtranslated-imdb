The worst movie in the world. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is like a bad porn without sex. The actors are among the worst I've ever seen, and could not have been worse, even if they tried to make a complete ridicule of this movie. The film must have a record-breaking, low budget that, as I am, was almost wasted on the cover of the movie. This movie is now a joke with friends and has become the standard for comparing other garbage films. I would like to point out that no other movie begins to compare. I feel personally responsible for a friend and I watching this movie. I am surprised that she still considers me a friend after the agony I went through. Do not see this movie
