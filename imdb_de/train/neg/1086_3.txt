Despite his impressive cast and crew pedigree, Gingerbread Man collapses early and often. The plot is unrealistically confused, the actors have bad accents and the involvement of director Robert Altman amounts to the collection of a paycheck. Again, he has put together an impressive cast (as Woody Allen would like everyone to work with Altman) that this time the letter is wrong. But that's just part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a highly qualified lawyer from Georgia, who manages to rid herself of a mysterious restaurant waitress who convinces her in the film's seedy opening scenes Ex-husband and a crazy dad. With red flags everywhere, the clever lawyer even tries to put his children in danger. Fist and fist battles ensue with a necessary chase and if that is not enough, a hurricane is thrown for the ridiculous finale. Branagh plays MacGruder with a floury and unconvincing southern accent. He walks in a trench coat in any weather and is blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as a P.I. but with a little more accent on the bad accent. Robert Duvall, the old man, is Boo Radely, everyone grew up more insane than a bed bug that serves some thick slices of ham, but at least his twang is plausible. The main female roles (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are meager and boring. Even the prominent lawyers who run cameos (Vernon Jordan) are made of wood with the few disposable ones they have. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unobtrusive actors, Altman's mise en scene is soaked with Spanish moss and drab informal, his comic-book action-scenes. He lacks his fancy touches and observations (he informs the audience that the stars and bars are still waving in Georgia) that make a successful Altman so unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is the worst in Altman, even if the pay is the same.
