I saw the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. JE. This was clearly noted immediately at the beginning of the film and then amplified approximately every five minutes. So it's safe for American guys to watch this movie. Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and make-up. She looked great in all of her short cameo scenes, which, although numerous, were probably shot one after the other the same day, with the director saying, "Okay, now you look pretty ... well ... OK, now scared look ... well ... look depressed now ... well ... look interested now ... well ... look nice again now ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Most of all Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. The Trojans looked exactly like the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. Brad Pitt does not squint camera. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's biggest line was, "They come for me." Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br / Brad Pitts thighs go all the way up. Achilles had a young boyfriend with whom he was very close, but it's fine. They were cousins. No matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with just one expression. <br /> <br /> Trojan gods evidently all had Greek names, but their statues looked either Egyptian or Peter O'Toole on the train. Greek men never touched, unless they fought each other, much like American men. All the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian by Max Factor. Troy had only three wives. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of blonde Greeks, for which there is good news Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have broken through. Despite their coastal location in the desert, the Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of wood to build fire, lynx, Trojan horses, and the like. <British actors look stupid with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt only changes the expression when the sun shines directly into his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers were constantly fighting, but their outfits always looked impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even if they were new.
