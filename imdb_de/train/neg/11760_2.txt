Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First of all, how do you know which movie to buy? Henry Cele plays the main role in each of them. I bought this movie because I thought it was the miniseries ... It would have been a comedy if the young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for Popcorn TV, but he did not believe in this movie (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT'S WITH THE LOVE STORY ??? The film was supposed to be about the rise of a young man's military power - not about the captain of the slave ships, who became jiggly with the English girl looking for her father ... <br /> <br /> If I have more than $ 7 Film would have paid for it, I would have to call the police - because that would be a crime!
