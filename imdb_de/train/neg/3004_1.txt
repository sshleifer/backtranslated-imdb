What a horrible movie. The acting was bad, the tempo was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special effects" were bad. They expect a degree of wickedness from a Slasher, but even the murders were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event that triggered the battle motive lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% and explained what happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to a "reunited" school for "reunification", where all resources were still turned on. One of the victims found this a bit strange, but they refused and decided to break in anyway. <br /> <br /> After all, the killings were so fake that they were practically beyond reach. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts, not very good breasts. This movie makes showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
