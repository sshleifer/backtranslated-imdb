I sometimes really enjoy lousy films ... those that occasionally arise when people (even talented people) come together with good intentions to make a film, and for whatever reason, it's a disaster. Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," "Plan 9 from Space," "Manos-Hands of Fate," and "Heaven's Gate," and so on. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard that, "Rachel's Attic "was considered by many to be the worst movie of the decade. Of course, I HAD NOT just seen it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret this decision. This movie is more than bad ... it's so bad it's not even as comfortable as the usual bad movie. The acting, the filming, the script, etc. are even worse than a low-budget pornography: The sound is absolutely terrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "drama" is ridiculous ... it's a complete waste of all time and money. At least, pornography has porn to break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare makes a guy squeeze a lazy apple and a tea party mad madder. The lighting is not available. Many "scenes" take place in half or full darkness, which is probably true. The "author-director" (I use the terms casual), David Tybor, tries to get tangled up with bondage scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of such profound quality that it actually acts as a sexual oppressor. I could go on forever and not live up to all the shortcomings and flaws of this really horrific movie waste. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid God's love, this train leak should be avoided. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you might be tempted to see if this piece of garbage is really as bad as I claim it to be .... but trust me ... it It's even worse than I said, and you'll absolutely regret the experience (and the cost of wasting your money on a purchase or rent).
