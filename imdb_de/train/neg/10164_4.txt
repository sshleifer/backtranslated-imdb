I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and can not quite decide. We were not allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to take care of them. Maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own, but these people did not force me to worry about them or shocked them with their various destinies. With a running time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. Much time has been spent on equipment of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyors, shovels); and the somewhat sinister-looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that made the most of their livelihoods were somehow more interesting than the living humans. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never came together.
