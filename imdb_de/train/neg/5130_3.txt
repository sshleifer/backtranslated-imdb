Janeane Garofalo was very public in her displeasure with this film, naming her an anti-feminist, among other things. She also said in her radio show that she hates "romantic comedies" because she does not believe in them. I totally agree with Janeane here. This movie is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall it was just another boring, unbelievable "romantic comedy" that has no foundation in the real world. While there will be some who say "suspend your disbelief," getting tired of it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood will make you tired. For some reason, Janeane's character is usually cast in shadows and darkness, making her look unattractive, while Uma's character is shot in lighter tones (which probably displeases Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she loathes this movie). This really hurts the movie if we want to buy the premise that Janeane should be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and in other commentary threads, Janeane is not ugly, but very nice indeed. I did not read a report in which someone said that Uma looked better. However, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would most likely stay with Uma and not with Janeane. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men), and unfortunately Ben would probably have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unsightly, it does not work. Nevertheless, their natural beauty has an effect. <br /> <br /> I think many of the male fans of Janeane who are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think in the character of Ben Chaplin and in fact score points with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine). This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, because this really is not a good movie.
