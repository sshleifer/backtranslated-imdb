Absolutely the worst movie ever by Burton, who seems to get worse and worse with every movie he conducts. A lousy script loaded with clich√©s is just the first of many objectionable aspects of this movie. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you hear someone calling, "he has lost his weapon!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is really terrible and Wahlberg too, who just can not play that and can be persuasive. Very nice effects and photography, but bad music in the John Williams form of Burton's buddy Elfman. Heston appears in a non-dense scene to utter his most famous phrases from the first film. Very bad results. <br /> <br /> If anyone else has seen "Sleepy Hollow," they'll probably notice, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films. I heard that this project was initiated by others and that Burton was appointed as a director. In that case his sentence should be questioned. But I think he let every possible vision he had earlier in his career slip away; The proof is contained in the films. In "Sleepy Hollow," he could not decide what kind of movie he was doing, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you believe it was a kind of monster rally movie (that's never scary, as horror fans know). The film could not succeed in either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "Planet of the Apes" is about the same way, and the result comes more from "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than from science fiction. He has also fallen into the mill of many other "great" directors who try to satisfy the entire potential audience. When you're out there, you can contact Burton. Choose something and do it directly, or use a style to cut it all together (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") I, the fans of your movies will stop walking.
