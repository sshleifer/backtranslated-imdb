I liked the return of Frosty and not. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been made, but Frosty's return was the worst because the snowman they had pulled had nothing to say. Frosty's winter wonderland was great, and so was the original heartwarming drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty, the snowman was like the classic '60s and a weird line, as if they were talking about things that are not real, and then Frosty hums at the window and whistles what he did, but everything else was poorly written and poorly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover in the library about two or three years ago and the art looked grumpy. I did not pick it up until this year, because the pictures on the back are a bit touching, but I played this movie. It was a tedious art figure like the DVD and it was just awful what was going on. I looked at it at night and found it boring that I fell asleep at the whole thing (wait, I always do that when I look at something while I'm sleeping). But this movie was boring overall. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Grade C <br /> <br /> This is like another holiday, especially bad rip off in the frosty returns and this one. This is the bad fourth episode like "Home alone 4". Well, I thought that the movie is okay, but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home that hate 3 and 4 people like that. My sister did not see it that often, because when she came to my room and saw two and a half minutes, she walked away like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her as much as the third Frosty. Simply terrible!
