This must be the worst movie ever !!! The drama is scarier than the movie. Lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, because they do not even show you the cuts. I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were seeing a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a shame for horror movies !!! If they are in Asia, why is a white bull driving the garbage cans of waste management ?! There is so much of another language that you do not even know what's going on half the time. The film cut is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and this disgusting old man was working at the window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!! NOT TO SEE HOW BAD IT IS IF IT DOES !!
