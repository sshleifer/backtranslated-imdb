Okay, I rented this movie because of the director ... he has done some interesting movies in the past (if you have not seen Waxork, miss a fun ride). Anyway, from the beginning I had my doubts about this movie, but I decided to soak up the movie and watch it. It's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie yet and spoilers do not mind, read ahead. First, here is the old adage "You can not judge a book by its cover". The box for this movie seems to indicate that Jill is the stonefox with long hair and highlights. The back of the box shows a cool setting of the red leather Jill and some other settings. Because of the description you want to borrow the movie because it sounds good. You begin to look at it, and suddenly you realize that the movie (inexplicably) plays in 1977. The movie is not quite as predictable as you think ... and that's not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without a little motivation ... it's embarrassing to see. 10 minutes before the end of the movie, Dolph and another woman have no reason to have sex. And what was the point of Dolph killing that other woman in cold blood who had helped him? Anthony Hickox, the director, should have seen a stinker reading the script. If it had been set in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters reasonably intelligent, it might have been decent. To put it in the 70s makes no sense and has no influence on the story. Avoid it!
