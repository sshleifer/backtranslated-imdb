I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've ever seen. A very troubling issue with this film is that real scientists are interviewed, but the footage is cut so that it seems they support the ideas of the many BSers who populate the film. The BS signal ratio of the interviews is ten thousand to one - in the end, respondents seem to say, "We want you to think !!", but they themselves are too lazy to simply research the things they claim as a fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel you are open-minded and want to increase your awareness, you should be open-minded enough to read some books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe," Nigel Calder (a slender volume , no challenge), "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can not bring yourself to read a book, do not complain to reviewers that they are "open-minded." <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this movie is just incredibly bad. <br /> <Do you know what a really good movie is that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
