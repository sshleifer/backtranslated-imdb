Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour faces the challenge of creating a French 1930s musical in vivid colors. The opening with old, embossed subtitles was a nice touch. Then the camera opening (like the old winches) opens on a black and white poster. The camera pulls back (or rather up) and suddenly shows us the surprisingly brilliant colors of an elegant table for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgetful daddy with an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls chattering a nonsense that's not relevant to the movie (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). These characters rush out the door and are replaced by more people breaking into an even more forgettable song. Then they go, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first noteworthy dialogue after 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais was up to when he started cacophony with such a yawning time and music waste. The effect on the viewer, however, is that you want to throw cones on the screen and storm. I endured it. <br /> <br /> It did not get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to take care of the people in front of the camera). People scurry around the stage like moths around a lamp and we can not focus on a specific person or action. It's like taking every episode of the Brady Bunch and packing it into a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has kept me watching (1 hour) is that I looked at the camera technology, the lighting and the scenery, all of which, I admit, are excellent. But is that enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to watch the end. Aw, who am I kidding? I have more important things to do. I am sure that you will do that too. Skip this.
