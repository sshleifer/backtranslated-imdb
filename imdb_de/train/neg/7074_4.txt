My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie, I expected a romantic drama and a great performance from Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but she's not the right actress for this role, she's too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija's characters is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzija's character (an organizer of Wonman), he's not charming in the movie anyway. How did Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon), I can not understand. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro, or Harrison Ford would have done a better job in that role, but they do not have the European look, I think. Anyway, I was so bored while filming the movie. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound, her best movie yet. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and older man try Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so underrated, and she deserves a better chance than this. I wish that she will make a better choice in the future.
