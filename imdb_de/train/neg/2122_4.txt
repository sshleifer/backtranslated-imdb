Although Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some aspects of the narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The film gets juicier and more manipulative as it approaches the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Amores Perros by Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 grams with many, many flashbacks. The problem is that the story of VERY easily foreseeable by the movie is. That's a pity, because Seven Pounds could have been so "good" in such an authentic way if Ben and Emily had been placed in the right hands.
