Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and the Future War a chance to make money as his worst movie ever. It's fun to laugh about where Manos was only painful to watch. Hobgoblins end up somewhere in a time capsule as the perfect movie to describe the term "80's cheeze". Acting (and I only use this term loosely) is cruel, the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you'll ever see, and the gardening tool fight must be seen to be believed. The film was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to see this mess. This movie offers Mike and the Bots a lot of ammo to pull some of the funniest one-liners they've ever made. If you try to see this without the help of Mike and the Bots ... god, help !!
