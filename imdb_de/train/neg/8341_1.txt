I love horror movies. I even appreciate most cheeses (to be honest, 9 out of 10 horror movies are CHEESE today), but that was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, terrible writing, completely hollow and incredible characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a lack of sufficient body size. I wish I could the 79 minutes of my life that I had just wasted, SALVAGE. At least the Crook brothers are aptly named. The only good thing about the whole movie was how Alicia Silverstone wanted to be punched in the face. How this EVER ever made it to Sundance is completely confusing to me. The plot was largely unrealistic, even for Slasher film standards. I mean, come on! Who stormed after 10 seconds to get a cheap earring after a scary stalker guy had just left his door? Lame.
