Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget that name in his life. This is the movie that caused its demise. It was released with much hype, but plummeted and resulted in significant financial losses for its producers and traders. Rajinikanth had to personally repay her for the losses incurred. Soon after his release, he tried to go into politics, but failed miserably. It's a very bad movie with horrible drama, bad make-up, and pitiful script. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from a disease. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba in the theater on the first day of the first show. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I will not recommend it.
