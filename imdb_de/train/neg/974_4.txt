This movie sounded entertaining and interesting after its description. But for me it was a bit disappointing. Very slow and hard to track and see what happened. It was as if the filmmaker was picking up single pieces of film, throwing them in the air and putting them together no matter how they landed (definitely not in sequence). There was also no consequence turned. I've seen a few Korean films and found that a good deal of them are well done and require some reflection on the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this has completely confused me. I watched the movie a second and third time and it still has not done anything for me. I still do not really understand what the filmmaker wanted to convey. If it was just about representing a typical earthly part of a person's life, I appreciate that he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Of course, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
