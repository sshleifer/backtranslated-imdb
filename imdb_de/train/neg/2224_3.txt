I saw this for the first time when I was about seven years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of the events. It now turns out, 15 years later, that I remembered everything with great accuracy, because it seems that the authors never got beyond the outlines of history. There is no conspiracy to this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no background story, no character sheets, nothing. The good guys do things because they're good, while the bad guys just do things because they're bad. An unintentionally funny thing is when someone dies that you think is important and nobody cares. They just shrug their shoulders and move on. There is hardly any dialogue. If you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look because you want to see good animations and no other reason. Or if you like to look at lightly clad hot cartoon chicks (or lightly clad hot cartoon guys).
