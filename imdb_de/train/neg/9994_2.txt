Hmmm, a sports team crashes in a plane crash on a snow-covered mountain and faces the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions to survive. Does anyone sound familiar? I refer to "Alive" from 1993. The only big difference here is, of course, that a big, white, drunken horror of a yeti appears a few times to rip the dead away. I guess people taste better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The man in the first scene has no reliable firearm and no support in the hunt for the Yeti. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely wrong. It would either have exploded in the air, exploded on impact with the ground, or extinguished. People would not have survived, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Silent: They survived and are cold. It might be a good idea to use some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death. Fire is warm as it is ... WTF: The pilot has formed frost on his face while he lives and talks, but strangely nobody else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but around them are scattered parts of the plane ON FIRE. In the cold of the Himalayas they do not use the hoods! <br /> <br /> Silent: They stare at a pile of sticks, if, I repeat, parts of the plane are ALREADY BURNING. <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for their storms. It would be reasonable for them to collect the rubble to reinforce their structure instead of sitting outside the quarrels. There are many pines whose branches provide excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: If in doubt, use the arm of a dead man as a rail. <br /> <br /> WTF: If one man knows so much about the winter sleeping habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, why does he not know enough to provide protection and traps right from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When trying to catch wild animals, thoughtless conversation near the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a piece of broken glass ?! <br /> <br/> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were defenseless. The Yeti ripped the guy's heart out and stomped the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So two yetis and a comfortable avalanche to bury the evidence forever. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more stupidity, but most of the action takes place as usual in the last 15 minutes. Nice thinking with the spear and the chain, although this is some ingenuity (with the seemingly magical chain) that they lacked at the beginning of the movie, when they could not even make fire, even though it was all around them. <br /> <br /> As typical for sci-fi originals, the lovers kiss at the end as if nothing terrible had happened (not to mention that they ate human flesh and have not brushed their teeth for some days) <br /> <br /> In the end, though, the quote is lame.
