How can you get Disney? Preppy rich girls behave like idiots, buying a few things and getting a lesson. Is Disney trying to teach itself a lesson? That maybe everything should still be human at the time of purchase? Whatever psychoanalysis may be, this movie is shitty. <br /> <br /> The girls want a rich party for their rich life. Then the money disappears and they have to use their wealth to get the milk factory (yes, milk) to hire the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man in the beginning, who seems to be the one who takes the money, is the one. But the end is stupid. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh Never worth my time again. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "D-"
