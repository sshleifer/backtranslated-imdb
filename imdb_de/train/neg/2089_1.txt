Of course I have seen BG. I loved S1, I liked Season 2, Season 3 was OK and loved the finale. Yes, there is a spin-off show! I did not know that at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 3 episodes ... What a garbage! Teen drama festival. There is no science fiction ... well, hardly any. At the end of each episode we can take a look at a Cylon. That's all. Who cares? Did you decide that the next target group will be women under 18? Boring religious nonsense, talking, moaning, bitching ... and much more. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there is nothing to see at the moment. Stargate ruined, BG over ...
