Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste your time with this piece of garbage. The effects are crap. Acting is crap. The only thing that could have made it even more bearable was a little cheap T & A, and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only quality that saves this film from afar is the very awkward profanity. It was as if they had found the only seven people on the planet who have never cursed. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, just go back and watch old prom photos. The only way for a Bigfoot movie is that he has a good budget and some actors who are not from the Frogballs Community Theater.
