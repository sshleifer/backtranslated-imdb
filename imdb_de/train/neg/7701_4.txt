The original show was so much better. They should have stayed well. This movie has destroyed the whole idea. It was boring and overly dramatic, and the funny parts were too far apart to make up for the slack. This movie really seemed to be too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention that it kept depressing the same thing over and over again for a long time. I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just boring and not so funny. We are sorry. 4/10 stars it is. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
