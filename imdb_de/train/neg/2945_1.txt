I saw this movie when Joe hosted Bob Briggs monster vision at TNT. Even he could not enjoy this movie. The only reason I've seen him through to the end is that I was teaching video production and wanting to make sure my students never did that bad thing ... but it took all my gut work to persevere. It's like seeing your great-grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... painfully painful. <br /> <br /> If you take the actual film, immerse it in paint thinner and watch it, that would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the garbage bin of S-Mart, retreat as if it were a rattlesnake.
