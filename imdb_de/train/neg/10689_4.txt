Cuba Gooding Jr. is an intelligence agent who blames himself for killing the US president. I'll point out that this is not the kind of role for which this very talented actor is known, and this movie shows us why. He's working with a stubborn news reporter (Angie Harmon) to expose the conspiracy surrounding the death of the president and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game', your attention can not be simply drawn; Part of the action is good, the acting is not all bad and the story, although clich√©s and what has been done before, could have led to a fun and entertaining movie - WELL IT DOES NOT DO! Writing the script and directing makes it absolutely certain that you will not be drawn into the story at any point or that you have to worry about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
