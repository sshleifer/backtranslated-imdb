Stalker is right! Girl sees a man, a girl wants a guy, a girl wants to find worldly ways to bump against him, a girl does not leave him alone, a girl pretends to be a patient, a girl can not stop thinking about him to talk, a girl pretends to love another man (or two), he does not pay attention to her because she is annoying, the girl STILL does not leave him alone. Properly played, Drake's character could have been charming, but she is totally relentless in her persecution of Cary Grant's character. Her girlfriend is boring, and unfortunately Drake's attempt to play "charming screwballs" is "disconcertingly denied." Grant, as always, is himself, which is fine for Cary, but it's as close to an in-depth performance I've ever had seen from him. The direction is dull and the dialogue is just weak. <br /> <br /> Screwball comedy is very difficult to make successful, and when it fails, as in this squat butt of an attempt, it simply stinks. Even worse, Drake needs the entire movie to get Valium and a restraining order. It ruins every humor found in this drier mummy bush relic.
