I gave this loooooooooooong movie a "2" because of the attractive actors and half-sexy love scenes. If you can not read like a speed reader, NEVER come through the subtitles trying to speak Spanish speed. And what the hell is in the plot if you can not read the subtitles? Endless looks and morons and constant rejection. After about an hour boring. Some good cinematographs, but also some, DARK think that your screen has burned out. How all this won, I will never understand. It's hard to talk about "ACTING" because the main characters just stare at each other and look lovingly at each other, unless they push each other away. The character of Geraldo is so appealing that it's hard to believe someone would push him away. And what about his mother? I just did not get GET IT most of the time, except that there were three guys who seemed to be all involved.
