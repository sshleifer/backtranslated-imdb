This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad it looked weird. First of all, there is no conspiracy. The actors seem to be reading cue cards and doing the dumbest things. For example, to be hunted by dead people, but still go out and look for their friends. The zombies were horrible, too, and it was not nearly as funny as Romero's works that plunge into the movie. And the stupidest part of everything was that they repeatedly showed flashes of video games in the action sequences. As if we did not understand the video game, shooting zombies. In addition, all 20 people know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without aiming the weapon. And the way people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammunition. Stand around and wait to be jumped up. And when they are cornered in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of breaking the door. So stupid with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen in years. A B-movie on Cinemax is better.
