First a technical review. The script is so slow, it really is a 25-minute story that is inflated up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pitiful, they seem to have really taken students out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. As far as the whole "point" of the story is concerned, "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!) Is really nonexistent. Without the scene, "Let's shock and get great publicity," nobody would talk about this movie. It's so bad that it really bothers me to think about which better things the money could use. Believe me, I've seen some bad "Imperial Dresses" movies, but the only thing I can say for them is, at least, that they were well received and well done, while the camera shook in two scenes in that situation ! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
