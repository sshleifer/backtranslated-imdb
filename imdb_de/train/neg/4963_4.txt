It turned out to be another misstep of the ridiculous sci-fi channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow in the movie. Aaaaaaah! When I saw this part, I lost all hope. Then ... they made their way to a ship on which Christopher Columbus had sailed! When they reach Heorot (which is supposed to be a Nordic Methalle), the idiot science-fiction group decided to make Heorot look like a big stone castle. When I saw this part, I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but Sci-Fi still has to produce a good movie, so I do not know why I have my hopes. Oh..and Grendel and his mother are stupid too. (This comment is a topic on "Grendel") If someone from the sci-fi channel reads this, there is some good advice. NOT EVERY FILM YOU STAY ABOUT A BIG MONSTER THAT CAN TORCH PERSON IN HALF. AND DO NOT STOP BAD ACTIONS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN IN YOUR FILM! It does not help to help the movie, but it makes it worse !!!
