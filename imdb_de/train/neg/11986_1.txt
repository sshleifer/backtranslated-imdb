What a terrible writing and action. No personality What can you do not do well with a single character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with self dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this boy goes on a trip to see his father. The boy Jason takes a plane and the pilot suffers a heart attack and dies during the flight. So the boy crashes in a lake and survives. Then he runs around and survives in the wilderness until he is rescued. During this time he fights twice with a bear. The first time he fights off in the lake. The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and pokes the bear. Two shots of fake blood gushing from the bear's chest reminded me of Monty Python's The Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Even the child decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
