"Creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, which serves only to redeem the name of the previous film. It even reinforces the deficiencies of its predecessor, which were often predictable and cumbersome. However, the first time there were enough thrills to make up for the periodic breaks, resulting in an uneven but altogether quite entertaining effort. The sequel has few worthwhile moments, so that the transparency of the stories becomes even clearer. Now and then it delivers, but most of the time it stays there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and only desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life and takes revenge on the murderers of its owner. Teenagers are devoured by a water monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to track a careless car driver. None of these premises is bad in itself, but they lack inspiration. There are few surprises and no fear. This is a textbook example of unmotivated filming by numbers. It does not help that this cheap-looking movie suffers from a flat directional style, although frankly it does not do much work. In the end, the second story comes out the best, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the ideas are at best okay. George Kennedy, an unfortunate shopkeeper, does a fair, if not particularly inspired, job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as a guilty motorist and despite the predictable, superfluous material, is sympathetic to her plight. However, most characters are pretty thin overall. <br /> <br /> You might think, "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who was the director of the original, returned to write the script based on other stories by Stephen King. Make-up effects artist Tom Savini does a good, bloody job. Why is the movie a failure? I think Romero did not want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror sequels, clones, rip-offs, and so on, so it was certainly inevitable. I imagine the guy wrote the script in a hurry, picked up his paycheck and ran away. I think he had to do what was necessary to finance his own projects. We can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br /> Published by New World Pictures
