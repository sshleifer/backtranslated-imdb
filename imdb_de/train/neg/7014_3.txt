What a waste! This movie could really have been decent, but most of all the writing is crap and the main characters are rather flat and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical replica of the decadence of the late 70s was well done, but overall this movie was a huge waste of time. Instead, the film, which deals with similar themes and timeframes, is the great BOOGIE NIGHT.
