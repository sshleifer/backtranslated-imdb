Honestly, The Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. For the first 30 minutes, I sat stunned in my seat and tried to decide if I should ask for a refund. But since I had not paid to see it (passports), I thought I might as well stay. And I did not think it could get any worse. <br /> <br /> That did it. I'll quickly go over the low points (including some spoilers): the terrible abuse of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two graduate students. The characterization was inconsistent; For example, despite his testimony, Lane is a complete moron. Then there is the lame-o representation of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; We see a series of sensational newsoundbites, accompanied by ridiculous computer printouts of the translated Biblical code. Even terrible "action" sequences: Lane escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and the only time in which Lane actually seems to be in danger turns out to be a dream sequence! This is nice for writing assignments at high schools, but it's an inexcusable plotter in a movie. The tempo was bad: after a long upbeat, the first third of the movie changes scene every 90 seconds. Later the pace improves, but there is still too much unnecessary jumping. And as someone else mentioned, years go by, but no one (not even Lane's daughter) ages. That was confusing. <br /> <br /> But there are a few good things. The quality of the film (eg lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. The outdoor shots were well done and the shooting made a realistic impression. There are also some moments in the last part of the movie where Lane finally asks God to help him - which turned out to be very exciting - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked that because it was the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, a great deal of incomprehension followed. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the acting were ALL badly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just funny. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot had been firmer, more focused, and the characterization more pronounced, the film would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In short, omega code disappoints. In no case pay for it. I give it out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
