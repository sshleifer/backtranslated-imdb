I happened to spot this on cable and wanted to like it because I thought Sandra was pretty funny about the one I remembered. The only facial movement I had in the entire movie was overwhelmed by how horrible a movie I'd just gone through. <br /> <br /> The person who said this is one of the funniest films of all time, just a scene that's even worth a giggle. <br /> <br /> She's a much better singer than I remember, but I did not want to see a lounge act. <br /> <I think this is a movie you like very much, because he thinks he should and should not see it objectively.
