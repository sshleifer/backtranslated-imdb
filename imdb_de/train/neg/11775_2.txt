At the "Kroko" I would have loved to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend to watch this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development, eg. Kroko, the metaphorical German problem child, remains despite of some plotwise chances a pure metaphor without positive ability to participate. Non-inspired actor, non-developing plot. I suspect the film was doing an environmental investigation, but it was not successful: The camera looked wobbly rather than motivated. The images were low-contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure that the components do not give a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story, however, had some potential, she could have made a good short story.
