At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photographs and scenes of the fox were amazing. The story, however, was so slow and boring. And then the little girl starts to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. Everyone should know that they let wild animals go wild and enjoy them from a distance. This movie is a terrible example of the children watching him, trying to turn a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the meaning of the story should be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wanted to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes where predators are seen with the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a terrible story. The last dialogue I talked about was so stupid, at which time my wife and I shouted at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it!
