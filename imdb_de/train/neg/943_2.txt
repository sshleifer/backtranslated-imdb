Here's an interesting little movie that gives the phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes a "molecular rearrangement." Students are hopelessly killed by false coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a revival of classic B movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It is not an example of high camp fun that is far away. A glamorous showcase of breasts and buttocks shows our desire for pleasure and defies the horror that should have been 99.44% more. Bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best, supported by red blood and dead students. Cruel films like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a masters degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so just rest!
