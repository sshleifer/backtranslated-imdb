I saw this movie once and thought it was okay. Then my friends said at work, "Look again, it's better." So I did. And to my surprise it was BAD the second time! There is a word limit, so I'm going to get the ball rolling here. <br /> <br /> - The bombing was so stupid. Why on earth should someone wait to trigger the blast? - None of the characters is even likeable from afar. Not the first time, not the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single shot, nor can such a big fire be extinguished with a fire tiny fire extinguishers ... have the aforementioned 3 / 10 viewers actually saw the movie ??? - The camera is so shaky that I can barely say what's going on. This opening scene with the robot had put my belly off, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> - The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") would roll their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did the guy put his gun where a person was shot? Why would he spend so much time cleaning, reloading, aiming, and NOT being shot when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean to sound homophobic, but frankly, this scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too long for your own good, but too short for the amount of material in it. Bigelow seems to believe that the more action, the better. Looks like she's wrong - the movie is full of superfluous action scenes that distract you from the lack of central action. I know that Watchmen is 163 minutes longer, but at least the movie did not pull. This movie, on the other hand, feels longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfying at best. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and do not get into the hype.
