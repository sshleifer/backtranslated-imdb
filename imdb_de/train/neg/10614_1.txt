This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have already seen some movies. It's going to be a movie, but it's really a piece of garbage. A redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dance, but that can not make up for Sally Potter's disgustingly obvious tribute in itself. The plot of this film does not exist, and I guarantee that you will end up laughing. Especially where she starts to sing. It is absolutely unreal.
