OK, 2 has one of the worst excuses, 4 a movie I've ever had. Like all other Olsen twin films with the possible exception of the New York Minute, this movie had no story, gaping storylines, disgusting acting and even bad filming !!!!!!!!! If you have not thought, I hate Mary Kate and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I saw that was because I was really bored and nothing else was going on. I wonder if the twins will ALWAYS stop filming the same stereotypical movies in which they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location, and save the day by getting the help of two cute boys who immediately get over them drooling. The least is that they could have a guy, or they both drop the same guy. The plot in this story was so stupid and just stupid. even a toddler could see the flaws in it. Maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe with a different story. Anyone who liked this movie was not insulting - either really stupid, really artificial or did not see a really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and have only bad cinematic decisions. Anyway, I would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience. The only thing he's good at is a rib splitting laugh about the pathetic attempts to be cool. If you pay attention to laughter, it's funny. Basically, I give 0 or less.
