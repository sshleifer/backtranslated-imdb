A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in Nightmare on the Elm Street series, and the worst sequel of all time, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare in the Elm Street to get DVD box for my birthday and I have watched all the sequels. The dream child was undoubtedly the worst, I was surprised too, as the last two sequels went so well. But I think they just lost their charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy about where they were going. Alice just got more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so she wore the movie on her own, did not work for me. Freddy also loses his fear, this just got a bit stupid. Alice is back and she is carrying a child, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is back too and he will not take her too lightly, as she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. Nevertheless, he wants her child born again into the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy had parents too? Well, this is a nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is being investigated and Alice will soon find out how Freddy's childhood was and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street: All in all, The Dream Child is a bad movie and an insult to the show. I do not think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Only the story was really stupid, I mean, it might have worked, but once again it just went wrong. I know if you want to watch the sequels to Nightmare on the Elm Street series, you should check them out, but I would not really recommend them, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 3/10
