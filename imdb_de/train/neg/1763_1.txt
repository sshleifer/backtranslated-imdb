This is one of the worst movies ever made. Banal. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scored a point were some nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I imagine they would use films like these in Guantanamo or in another hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies have some redeeming qualities, but that does not matter. If I was there or worked on it, I would change my name. Really a shit. Hard to write, more than that, but I think the movie watchers in the world need to have a head about it. On the other hand, it is a great gift for people who do not like you. <br /> <br /> You could send it to politicians you do not like, in laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and many others.
