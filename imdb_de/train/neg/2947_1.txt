There were very few films that I could not get through. I made it through Battle Field Earth, no problem. However, this is one of the worst movies ever made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to act in it. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed to have this in a CV. I think it's a rare opportunity when almost every gag in a movie falls flat on his face. Well, it happens here. Not to mention the SFX. Look for the Dino with the control cables hanging from the back end! After half the movie, I was still looking for an action. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of hiring this and save 90 minutes of your life.
