In this film, the experiences of a couple of hitters (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag queens are described over a period of a few hours in one night in Miami. The convergent actions finally bring all people together in one place and at a time. The movie was entertaining enough, but the big problem was that it all happens at night, and many scenes have literally been underexposed enough to make it impossible to see what happened. In some scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Someone did not know how to operate a movie camera. Amazing that this movie was even released!
