Decent enough with some stylish pictures, but the tiny budget hampers things. <br /> <br /> I also feel that they have tried to shock you with some graphic, crazy website stuff. <br /> <br /> If you like anime stuff like Cyber ​​City and the AD police, this could be your way up the street. <br /> <br /> but basically it's the low budget, but not without its own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack from some unknown grunge / punk / post-grunge bands. It's worth it, if only for the soundtrack to try.
