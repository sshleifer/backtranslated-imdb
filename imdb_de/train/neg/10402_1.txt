Well ... I'm shaking, the original started in 1990 and I found the film very enjoyable to watch. however, they continued to tremble II and III. Believe me, these films ran off right after the first movie, I mean, ass-sheets ??? Well, only God himself is able to answer the question, "Why, in God's name, would they still make one of those dumpster dives of a movie?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, it can not even be considered the epitome of a bad movie because it does more than that. As I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and I hoped the little girl would crawl out of the ring through the TV and kill me. Did you really think that if you starred in the other movies as if you were from the Wild West, you would improve the movie (with exactly the same incidents)? Honestly, I would never suggest to buy this movie. I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
