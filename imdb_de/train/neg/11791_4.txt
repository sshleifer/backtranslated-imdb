I do not understand this The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has a nice pace, good editing and pretty good direction. Then, WHY, WHY, WHY did not they hire someone to rewrite the script, so it's not so damn cheesy, and why, why did they hire such lousy actors who can not figure out a paper bag? This movie could have been good. Mostly it looks and feels good, but in the end you realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. What a pity. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come on, really!
