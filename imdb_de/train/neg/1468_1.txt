Wasted cast for worthless script. Ten adults met in the summer camp they had visited as adolescents. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy and a boring one. Will they become teenagers again? Do you play their pranks, games, good times? You may try, but in the end the answer is no. Are there any intrigues? Any tension? Scary? Comedy? None of the above. How someone can be entertained by this jerk is incomprehensible to me. I wanted to like this movie. I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
