My children watch the show every day, which runs. It's a great program for younger kids. However, you must stop showing repetitions, do some current shows, and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearls and the kids notice these things and ask if they never brush their teeth? Will the show ever find its way to the United States and if so, where do we find their schedule? And something else if we could add. You must stop hiding so often. Sometimes, when you emerge from nowhere, where you frighten the younger kids and what about pulling the rope? What does that mean? others will always get wet. You have to add newer things to your show instead of the same old ones. Children lose interest in this way.
