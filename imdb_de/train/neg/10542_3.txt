Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a serious problem on his hands. Serial killer Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), who was helped by the extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) in his arrest, was revived and can own it with The First Power (which Satan gave him after his execution in the gas chamber) the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who teamed up with Tess (who knows what they're going to do), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in his bloody hands. They will ask for help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen), who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing World of his evil. She will still accept it and help Russell, who needs all the help he can get when Channing hijacks Tess to prepare Tess, who prepares her for a kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets Russell's partner ... so you know what's going to happen to him. As in movies of this nature, everyone around Russell dies, but when he tries to kill Channing, he only murders the weak host of another poor soul he owns. <br /> <br /> Pure occult waste ... stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith are trying, I'm giving them that, but in such a movie they have no chance. Kober, who usually acts as a Heavy, gets really nothing but a stupid villain who jumps in the air and throws rotted jokes.
