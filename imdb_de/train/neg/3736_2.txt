This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams fit in as if a rhinoceros fit into a tutu, though his performance was still pathetic. Kurt Russell was more credible, but still terrible. The conspiracy left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was terrible too. The only thing that had this movie was the trailer that led me to waste 90 minutes of my life, which could have been better to lick the back of my head. <br /> Prefer and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy that you do not.
