What critics and MST3K have omitted is the best part (and the only memorable scene) of this otherwise terrible movie: There's a very good rape scene that the villain (Ben Gazzara) killed on Maria (as mentioned later by TJ's inability). Maybe rape is too strong a word, "prison mating ritual" could be more appropriate. The background for this chance, but a forced meeting is the gangster hiding "Ben Gazzara", and introduces him to the girls hanging by his pool. The 30-year-old blonde rejects him, but our villain must be thrilled with her, because the courtship takes place at this time. His first step is to try to drown her until his Mafia Don donor tells him to tear him down. A bit like the girl in high school that you do not like, but still want to have carnal skills anyway ... Let's just say he'll catch her up in the cabana later.
