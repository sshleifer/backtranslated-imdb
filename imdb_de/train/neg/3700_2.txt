Because only then one can not believe that this film is a total waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (worth seeing) was a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more of a vehicle to give rock some time for low stand-up comedy that does not go so well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes are usually from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but come from Rock itself. When he insults Blacks and Whites, the chemistry is completely wrong. The movie is not funny, badly filmed, acting is weak at best. Borrow "Heaven Can Wait" and a live rock video and you're far ahead of the game.
