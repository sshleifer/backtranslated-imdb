There will be a time when children grew up without the only Bugs Bunny (technically) kissing another man's lips. There will be a time when there is no duck or rabbit season. There will be a time when the Tazmanian devil is called politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But do not help me now. <br /> <br /> No one really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever comes up with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" in marketing, and this purulent guy should obviously know that they only know that they have a degree in economics or advertising or what does not mean that they kids know about Jack. <br /> <br /> I think they are doing a disservice to children and depriving them of one of the biggest and most famous shows ever. This show detests me, and it's not just the dated artwork or the dreadful dialogue. They abuse good vocal talents like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and many others. There is a lack of style, humor, character development and especially heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like the repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just a shadow of their earlier, timeless and beautiful self.
