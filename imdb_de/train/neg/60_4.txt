I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another of her films. When I saw Protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. Although slightly amusing, the movie never really takes a step forward. Some scenes like a party scene in a bar just take too long and really have no purpose. Then of course there is the sermon scene at the end of the film, which makes the film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene was ever added to the movie. I do not like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written mostly by some 1960's. <br /> <br /> Although I'm glad to have another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!
