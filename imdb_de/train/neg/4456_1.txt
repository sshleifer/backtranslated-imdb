This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The fact that it has a weak plot is bad enough that it has dealt with the subject of football violence, which makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I've had strict doubts about the premise of this film before I started to watch, but openly enough to accept the way in which the writers Elijah Wood's character Matt entered the hooligan scene introduced. But the film raises inaccuracies inaccuracies, to the point where everyone in the middle of the film contracts more than in the previous time. <br /> <br /> Let's clarify a few things: hooligans do not tend to smash their own pub virtually before a run-of-the-mill-league game; They do not want to kill each other; They ONLY carry Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not). If they have made an exception to a new permanent member, they most likely will not trot into the enemy company area to eat cake and porridge. And I would like to meet the hool who would browse the best boy of his company to the rival company. (Although you can scratch yourself over what I said, killing each other, if there is one.) <br/> <br /> Do not get me wrong. It contains some fantasy help, but this is equivalent to The Firm for ignorance. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that Woods' American Nemesis is morally condemned by his character because he is a cocaine consumer, if that is part of and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film decides not to question Woods morale, and keeps away with coke from the company instead. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I have set out my point of view. <br /> <br /> When it comes to action, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I had not spent the whole movie complaining and even more if I had made it upstairs I can guess what happened earlier. And believe me, I was well ahead. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional problems that are being raised. <br /> If I'm right, those are the creators completely failed. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman looking for emotional films would care less about the characters because of their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by a slow action, certainly not when it's a fight, since the point is that a jolt gets carried away anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's school trip made me smile. But a few funny moments do not make it good to see two hours of completely made cinders. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid the epidemic, if not to develop misconceptions about the scene, if you are not aware If you are American, you can enjoy it as it is clearly on tailored to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is weak, predictable and ultimately exaggerated.
