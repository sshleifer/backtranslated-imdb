Devil Hunter became famous for the fact that it is on the DPP list "Video Nasty", but that was really not the case. Many movies on the list where there were only known reasons for God (and DPP), and while this is not the hardest part of the group; There is not much here that justifies a ban ... which is a pity, because I would never have played it though it is not on the "grocery list". The storyline actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and taken to the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find them, but on the way he has to encourage the native, led by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title). The film basically trudges for only eighty-five minutes, and there really are not many interesting scenes. It is a pity that Jess Franco eventually made such films because the man clearly has talent. Unfortunately, as movies like The Diabolical Dr, Venus in Furs, Faceless, and She Kills in Ecstasy show, his good films are just jewels among the dunghill, and Devil Hunter is a big part of the crap. I only saw this movie because I want to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (only two more!). I think that's why most of the people who saw him saw him. But if you are not looking for nasties; There is really no reason to deal with this.
