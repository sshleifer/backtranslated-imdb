Is this the movie? Is that what Indians try to show? I think this is another effort by a sick director to give up Pakistani soldiers and land. But what we Pakistanis know, we are always ahead of India in all areas of our lives ... not just armed counter. <br /> <br /> Well ... that's bad than being filmed by Border at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and writer simply tried to overcome a shame of defeat in Kargil by the Pakistani armed forces by creating Movies like these .. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear ... Whenever there is an encounter between Pakistan and India ... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to do good movies instead of nonsense movies
