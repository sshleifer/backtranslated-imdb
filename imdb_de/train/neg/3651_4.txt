I expected a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes, and many that just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's offspring. It was confusing. It would have been funnier if they only had someone new, instead of resurrecting Moriarty. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was always very funny. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but she's played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not recorded much in the script. I expected a funny movie. Instead, I got a pretty confusing movie with a bad script. Rather ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together in this place. Maybe they wanted to dissolve in 77.
