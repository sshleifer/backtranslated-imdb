*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today, I had some expectations of what it would look like, not too high, but not low either. This was not as expected, but it seems to me that the filmmakers can not decide what kind of movie they should do. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it's a bit mysterious and somehow exciting, but that soon changes into a few ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I continued to watch, I almost fell asleep a few times. <br /> <br /> The end is the most ridiculous of all, almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that there are no good scenes, it's just that the movie never ends becomes "whole". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie Man
