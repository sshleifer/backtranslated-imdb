I could have imagined that a movie with the poltergeist lady would not be good. It starts off well, but during the first murder scene, you realize that the movie you're watching is a movie inside a movie. People are sitting in a cinema and watching this movie. A girl in the audience is so annoying that I turned around and strangled her. A bit strange, but not so good.
