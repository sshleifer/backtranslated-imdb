This is probably the worst movie ever made, except for the name Roger Corman. I could have understood it in his early years when he had a lower budget, but nowadays there are no excuses to give birth! I'm a "B" movie pervert, and from some point of view all my favorite movies are put aside by "regular viewers", but take my word for this movie. It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the score is completely out of place, the sound effects are just not effective, and finally Mr. Savage does not seem to know that the Vampire Club is at the top of the list. that he's in a vampire movie that's too bad because he had a "not too bad" career over everything. Let me know that I find it too difficult when I do not like a movie that I forget makes it a good site.
