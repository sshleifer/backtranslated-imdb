[I saw this movie late on a public television channel, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) of this Shirley temple in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe that anyone would leave his daughter in this racy little movie that can be considered today as the site of "child porn". Shirley Temple plays in a cast that probably has an average They're all in diapers and in a saloon where milk is served instead of alcohol. The "money" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "Femme Fatale" shashah to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about them (!). But Shirley does not really need her lollipop / cash because her purse is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a small black boy makes a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). <br /> What a funny movie. , , Infants playing racy dialogues playing adult roles in a salon. Who has come up with that?
