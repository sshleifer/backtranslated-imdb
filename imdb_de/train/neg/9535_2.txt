Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three. He is slower, the acting is worse and the story is very weak. There is not much good about this movie saying number three, and I would have thought that it is impossible. This is a very slow 90-minute time. I kept it up and hoped it would get better. Cheap rent from it.it is hard to find (for buying), and probably for good reason. Like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. I can give Best of the Best: No warning is 2/10
