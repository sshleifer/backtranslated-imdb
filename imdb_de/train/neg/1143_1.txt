Ninja Mission is about 20 years later, the worst movie, through which I have ever prevailed. Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, cheer wildly with their unpleasant loud machine guns, and then leave the building. Wow, how do we find these silent, invisible murderers? Just follow the clamshells and the smoke! Painfully bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and translated poorly?), No Asian in the cast and a total of three Asians under the stunt crew. The plot is ridiculous, the acting quite non-existent - then Ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid at all costs!
