I never thought that the standard of Yashraj films would ever go down so much! The film has a nonsensical action that does not arouse interest. <br /> <br /> Saif has exaggerated. Kareena has improved her figure but is still not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is good too. May I say that the role was not good. <br /> <br /> Much cheaper is filled out. I wonder if that should be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because the last few movies were flops, does that mean that Yashraj movies should do that sort of garbage? It has a story about so many good movies. Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
