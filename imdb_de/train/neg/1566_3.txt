For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this film is to sit back and read the mistakes, inaccuracies, combined events, exuberant events, highly exaggerated events, frisky people, timeline errors, erroneous quotes, fake clothes, and out of place songs (Shame Shame) Wrong instruments and other boners that I just can not think of. The mistakes come quickly and angry, so you have to be on your feet. <br /> <br /> I did not give this "1", mainly due to the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors Band Rain) give it all (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also the song "Cry for a Shadow" can be heard at a certain time, and that counts for ETWAS. <br /> <br /> So, look at it for fun, but do not take it as historically correct.
