It was not the nastiest animated movie experience, but it certainly can not be admired as much as it tries to be good. Dreamworks animation and computer graphics are the story of a Mustang later called Spirit (Matt Damon, who represents the first-person narrative) and his journey across the borders of the Old West. Basically he is born free of all other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, and he manages to throw off all those who want to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has something for Little Cakes female horse. In the end, after a few more escapes pursued by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men and making a final big jump over a ravine, Little Creek releases Spirit, and he releases his female horse and they run home for their landscape and riding horses. Also with Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad foreman, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I had expected the horses to be entertained in this movie, but it turns out to be more of a Dumbo thing, and the songs of Bryan Adams are not very appealing, but it's not a horrible movie. It was nominated for Best Animated Film Oscar and nominated for Bryan Adams' "Here I Am" as Golden Globe for Best Song. OK!
