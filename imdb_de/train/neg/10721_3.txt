An expedition headed by Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to a previous expedition. They meet the beautiful, mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann), who joins them. They soon face a blood-dripping mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I caught this on late night television at about 10 years old. That made me sleep! When I see it all these years later, I can see why. It's slow, the mummy only appears after 40 minutes (and that's only 66 minutes!), The acting ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there is no blood violence to be found. This movie focuses more on second-rate drama (with a stupid love triangle) than on horror. <br /> <br /> This is rated three stars because it looks pretty good. It's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three) are not bad. They are not scary, just slightly scary. Nevertheless, this movie is pretty bad. A safe cure for insomnia.
