This is just a response to Yahoo saying that this movie is more realistic than the classic, MASTERPIECE, Jaws defining genre. Yes, brainiac, great whites (and other shark species, bulls, blacktips, oceanic white tips, tigers) populate areas where easy prey is. People do not come into this menu often, but the shark in the movie has repeatedly been called an unusual behavior. It's not like it never happened. The likelihood of a killer whale destroying almost an entire city, selecting a human enemy, sinking several dozen thick shelled North Atlantic fishing boats, and knowing that certain people, all friends of the above-mentioned Nemesis, are close enough to reach the water , are so slim that they are ridiculous. Similar to this jaw of Jaws. Ridiculous. It is also known that white sharks often chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce (if you do not know, look up) would be more than able to sink a boat like The Orca (hey! That's the rip-off we're talking about!)! it would weigh over 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not have to. Jaws is unbelievable (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is crap (Jaws' BLATANT rip-off, lousy writing, hideous effects, most ludicrous plot on this side of an Olson Twins strip). You do not need a masters degree from Columbia University to see that. Watch better movies.
