I searched for several years for semi-decent movies that I can borrow for my kids. I have developed a sixth sense for discovering the really cheesy direct video efforts that are really painful (for anyone older than the kids eight). I dropped the ball and the kids spent half the movie asking me, "what did she say that for?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes got sore if I rolled them every minute because the characters had done a really bad job introducing seemingly random plot changes. And next time someone decides that there is absolutely no skill in a sword to "just bring realism" to a movie, please do it with a blunt butter knife. "Prehysterie!" was head and shoulders above it. Arrgh.
