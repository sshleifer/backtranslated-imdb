I love the book "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and their mistakes. This was one of the worst I have ever seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and definitely looked, but she had no emotions in her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even fewer feelings than Jane, if that was possible. It's a mystery how two such bland people could fall in love, but it certainly did not stop me. Maybe the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> The version of Timothy Dalton (too good for Mr. Rochester!) is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version (NOT the Book corresponds). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this film: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
