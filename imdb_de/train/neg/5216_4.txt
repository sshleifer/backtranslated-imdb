"Metamoprhis" is the story of a brisk young scientist who is worshiped at the local college and is being studied by funders for the college. This forces him to take shortcuts in a typical melodramatic way from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My first thought after closing the film was as follows. "Not good, but not bad for the early eighties." Of course, then I realized that it was done in 1990, which means almost a "4", but I decided to keep it at the mediocre "5" that it is. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' seems to be on some occasions like a good movie trying desperately to come out. The spectacle is not outstanding, but mostly competent. You can even see the occasional gleam of a modest quality. The tempo is a big problem with the movie. After thinking that I had watched for ninety minutes, I realized that I had only looked for an hour. The special effects are not outstanding, but the director seems to be largely competent enough to circumvent this weakness. <br /> <br /> The main character, a mildly charismatic man who tries a mixed channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mainly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does a good job, but does not differ. There's a "naughty girl" role here, and the actress does what she can, but it does not seem to be much. There is a child actor whom the director can not decide, whether he is grumpy, happy or just funny. <br /> <br /> Stepping is, as I said, the worst problem in this movie, until a final fight with the evil that would make a power ranger blush. It's bizarre and inexplicable, until the last scene, which is supposed to be dramatic, but just funny, with every bad camera trick and hyperbole that can be compressed in about thirty seconds, look at the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack' on. Nothing that will bring you back and nothing that you can buy alone.
