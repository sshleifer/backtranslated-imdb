That's really terrible: painfully irritating, stylized performers screech and scratchy incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, neither beginning nor middle nor ending, with no apparent narrative or even cognitive intentions serving some completely uninteresting and almost undetectable "history". What makes the movie even worse is the movie's claim to "style": Suddenly, a distant crane shot down spirals, and for no apparent reason, there are suddenly whips or shaky, hand-held sections: all of this "style" serves just to magnify the incredibly incredible misunderstanding of the project and the almost obvious emptiness of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
