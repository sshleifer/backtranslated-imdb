Wide enough for you? Wait until you see this cumbersome adaptation of a small college act. What's shocking and ferocious at school is rarely found over time, and that's proof. The <br /> <br /> catholic church with the broadside humor is not shocking or interesting or funny, but boring. The actors are all a <br /> <br /> game that gives everything they have, but it's basically a game that does not open well for filming. Not much fun.
