Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a student of the Satan / serial killer who owns the First Power: Even after being captured by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he can divert his mind from the body on body and continue to murder at will. With the help of the attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G's half-sister) he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some options, I think, but ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine scripting and filming. This is not something we have not seen, sometimes done better. There is nothing about this film to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. To put it in a nutshell, it's not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is a hard sell as the tough stereotype of a cynical policeman, and Griffith does not seem to be trying hard. Best Actor is probably the iconic Kober who does his best to be extremely scary. <br /> <br /> The climax is quite stupid and the end very weak. <br /> <br /> Not really acceptable enough to rate as average film of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
