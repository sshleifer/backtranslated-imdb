This notorious end of Koen Wauters' career became clear to me through the "Night of Bad Taste". Judging by the commentary index, I was not the first and I'm not the last person in Western Europe who learns that this musician (no doubt one of the best in our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree) has tried to be an actor , Whether or not he should have made the attempt can not be judged. <br /> <br /> He is very sympathetic to Intensive Care, but he seems uncomfortable with the movie he is participating in. Nobody can blame him. It deserves its ranking in Verheyen Hall of Fame by all means and standards. The story of the Murderous Maniac, who died in an accident but is alive and angry, has been told dozens of times. Even without original twists, a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative backdrops and cinematography. <br /> IC is content with a hospital wing and several townhouses. The tempo is boring. The tension loses the last part of its credibility for the score, as each appearance of the killer is accompanied by a boring threatening melody, followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders, which can at least hint as small as a small budget implied. The sex scene is free, but not in the least appealing. The pair from Amsterdamned could have done it. During the subject couple: The entire subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could be made on the screen if they had just been co-comrades who solved their nerves halfway through the intercourse. I will not even give the other actors the dignity of a mention, for they should all have been chopped up into tiny, greasy pieces. In fact, most of them do. The ones I remember were obvious to the genre: a pretty nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> In a slasher, therefore, the cavalry only comes in time to save itself. The (anti-) hero usually has to eliminate the villain by clever thinking, because former red berets often get no parts in these films; They could overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. Translated into the events, Wauters kills the doctor and rescues the lady in distress. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not done yet. That's not the story. Wauters makes his heroic attempt, but is beaten with a rage that comes close to "A Clockwork Orange". So it's up to the girl to pick up the drill-killer act and pierce the brains of the doctors. Although this method ensures the death of the killer more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets, the surgeon survives to allow the IC to reach the 80-minute mark. Intensive Care is a bad movie that only Bad Taste lovers can enjoy. He can check Verheyen's catchy statements and come up with something for himself. For example, the (unintentional) parody value of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the last confrontation in the park (the persecution on Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> But let me give you an overview of a few elements that give some appreciation to the IC. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a terrible monologue of a fellow doctor / French actor and look horrified when they burn him up to mark his big name in a stand-in. He could have played his naked gun part again to finish as beef, but with a longer screen time. The finale can be one of them. I'd never seen a lunatic brought into his guts by fireworks to push him against a flexible fence. It's good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Call a good point in terms of intensive care ... Koen Wauters has learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. I wonder how many issues of the Paris Dakar race he has to stop before he comes to his senses. <br /> <br />
