Amateur in the extreme. Camera work specially revised - Documentary Cameraman does NOT have to turn ALL the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really crazy and the spectacle is even worse. Moreover, the story is incoherent and meandering - with some gaping gaps in logic. At some point, the executive wants to be jailed to work with the alleged al-Quada activists and to get an interview with Osama. I found the story absolutely unbelievable due to the many mistakes. The "filmmaker" / lead role is really a dissolute, idiotic friend. The only thing that really matters is that the filmmakers actually shot on location. It is a pity that they missed their chance to do something interesting. Who financed this crap?
