Why every horror director "The Exorcist" wants to imitate is a complete mystery to me, because William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and in my opinion not that tense or shocking. And yet here is another clean rip-off, this time a Spanish one who shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl obsessed with pure evil and turning against his own family. Paul Naschy (I must admit he looks pretty hot here) plays the venerable priest approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior has changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with a twisted neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more conspicuous ... "Exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, but also an unbearably boring movie! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make an exploitative film with religious theme and shock and blood, and yet the result is a tame and bloodless drama that would almost make you fall asleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there is a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute budget deficit is no real excuse, because Paul Naschy has already proven in advance that he has enough imagination to compensate for a lack of money. This is just a horrible movie, end of story. Other European "The Excorcist" rip-offs are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they suck too!
