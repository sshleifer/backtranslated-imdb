Was this Tim Meadow the first role in a movie? The character leon is funny enough, but soon after, the sexual jokes and humor are too stupid to hear. Some films can come through with the sexual jokes and make the audience aware that this is correct when the advertisement appears. Some movies that do this are American cake and scary movie. scary movie was stupid, and American pie would not be well without sexual jokes. The only role next to Leon, who had a bit of humor, was Will Ferrell. The character was really stupid and that was all, the stupid humor was everything that watched me. The movie was fine and nothing else. I do not really understand why the little people who want to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. The skits take about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie out of a 5-minute sketch, what's the world going to be about? Molly Shannon had superstar, Cheri O'terri had a scary movie, but she did not star and the will had eleven. but that was good, but he made a stupid movie, but I can not remember and mike myers with waynes world. How come that the crazy TV crews never get movie offers? seen only a guy break, but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick. But this guy relies on the comedy, so he can continue his life, funny or not. This movie is not good, but had a positive sense of humor. What a waste of film and human money. (D D-)
