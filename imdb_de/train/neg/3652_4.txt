I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected, but I was disappointed that the DVD screen did not appear. I'll say that my original reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. I feel like it's fun to watch that it does not meet my expectations that I've found so far from their other films. I was also very pleased that Arkin has shown a humorous performance. The other two actors, whom I was not very familiar with, can not compare their performance, but they were also quite pleasant. Acting is in my opinion the only endearing quality of this film. The storyline was, while some might say, captivating, the direction is lacking. I feel that the main problem is from the script and not from the direction of this film. If you like one of these actors, I recommend this movie, but leave it alone otherwise.
