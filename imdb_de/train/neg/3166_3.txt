I admit to having a rather uncomfortable feeling about ghost movies, and even though sometimes I enjoy the genre of horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really have to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to take the life after death a little too seriously and fails in my opinion on almost every aspect that I can think about. The story is of course absolutely incredible and could convince me neither in the comic book nor in the sentimental register. The choice of leading actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd at least looks good-looking and looks like a nice guy, the taste of the ladies of his character seems to be seriously improved as Eva Longoria is too old for him (sorry) and Lake Bell seems too unattractive. A romantic story without reason enough for the romance has failed from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but had only supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematographs and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful television comedies. Nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
