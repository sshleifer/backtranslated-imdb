Since many horror films assume that one or more of the main characters will do something stupid at some point during the process, the girls in this film would be collecting gold, silver, and bronze at a Darwin Awards ceremony. A mentally retarded baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have cried much less. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a coarse-grained image, are intentionally hobby camera work (my 92-year-old) Old grandmother has a camcorder (with better results), an extremely bad sound and no recognizable plot / narration. Then this is the ideal movie. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women who scream for no reason, women who moan for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "We have to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can not believe I talked to her like last night." "She called you last night?" "Yeah, she wanted to talk about a date she was asked" "WHAT, how'd she not tell me?" Our friend is being followed by a serial killer with a shotgun and a series of gruesome weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me she has a date. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the budget is low. That does not mean you have to make it look like it costs half the budget. The "score" is interesting because all but one track was written and performed by the authors / directors of the film itself. It seems that the entire budget has been inflated by sampling a track by The Duskfall, a Death Metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing in the entire film is the end of us with the possibility for a sequel.
