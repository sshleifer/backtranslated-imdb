THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (The Gatto a Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (35mm and 70mm prints) <br /> <br /> A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) hears a blackmail plan in front of a genetic research lab and later works with a reporter (James Franciscus) to do a series investigate murders in the lab that unintentionally saw their own relatives subject to a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> Following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH CRYSTAL CARE (1969), Dario, production began. THE CAT O'NINE TAILS was conceived by Argento as a Giallo thriller, roughly the same Direction as his forerunner served. The famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden was honored by his appearance in PATTON (1969) and the rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which was "nine times more exciting" than the "Bird" according to the ad - a disappointing result, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too flat and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br Malden and Franciscus are outstanding in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world of Argento's dark hearted Scenario unfolds, but the subplot with the Eurostarlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as the romantic interest of Franciscus does not mean much more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded train station (edited by Franco Fraticelli) with a sleek accent, and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek out an important clue in a moaning tomb Loot fall the abominable machinations of the murderer. Despite these flashes of brilliance, the film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene and cooks gently without ever really getting to the boil. It's no surprise that "Cat" did not mimic the resounding success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
