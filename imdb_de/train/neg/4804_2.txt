I do not watch a lot of TV and came across this show. Reality show? I'm sure that's not real. If I was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so astute, that would be a divorce ground. I think she gives a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love. This is one thing that is wrong in our world right now, so that many people in bad relationships are selfish and do not know what it means to truly love another. It's self-sacrificing and not something that should be on Merritt. This does not make you feel good about seeing what should be in private counseling. If his personality on the show is real, then he deserves someone who is much better. He would show real love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or will the review be made up ???? I would really like to know. Sincerely, GB
