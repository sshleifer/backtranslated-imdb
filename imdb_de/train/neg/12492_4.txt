This is one of those movies that has a fantastic video box but has wired Camra works and unknown actors talking to bad conversations. This is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before she worked) and she is a good actress , I like low-budget movies that have flaws because it's fun to watch, but unfortunately, Severed is not one of them. This movie is fine if you like to watch voodoo and severed heads and then rent Severed.
