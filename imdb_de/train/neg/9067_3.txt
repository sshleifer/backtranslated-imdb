Although I had some hopes for this film, especially because I enjoy the acting of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen lately (Loser and Dr. and the women are also on this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a few loud moments, although the movie could have been so much better. The premise was not so bad that cheaters who have cheated on their way through college make their match when discovered by someone with a suggestion for them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikely that none of them mattered to me. The blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it was not funny to watch him - he was not crazy in a particularly witty or charming way, he was just a crazy loser who was actually pretty dangerous doing it not fun to see. The editing of the film was difficult to understand - it was always cut between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear which was that. Only two or three of the gang's scams were actually shown, all you had to do was believe that they were really cheaters - showing that their plans for a better movie had been made. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was stupid and poorly written and judged through and through. I could talk about the shortcomings of the movie, but you have the idea. Not worth the $ 4 rent or the gas needed to drive to the movie shop and rent it!
