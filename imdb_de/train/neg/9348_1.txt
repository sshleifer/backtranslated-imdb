I found this movie embarrassing to see. I felt like the story was being thrown in my throat as if I could not pick up on the intricacies I needed to make them all speak out for me all the time. Alcoholic, I did not really feel like it was a movie about alcoholism in itself. Alcoholics, real alcoholics, in my opinion, of course, very lonely people. They find it hard to communicate, something the main character really had no problem with, unless he had a problem with saying at a certain time that I loved you. This was a weak attempt to establish his cold character. He was also constantly surrounded by people !? <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that we were never really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I could not connect with the character and did not feel connected to my dad at all. I felt nothing when it was done, just relief, it was over. Kevin McKidd is an okay actor, but not a tough guy! The orange clockwork was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, he should have had three different characters or avoid the teen phase and focus more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> I think the actor of the little boy was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
