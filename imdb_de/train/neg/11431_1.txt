It's important not to be offended by a lack of logic or common sense, and those who have "gray issues" will agree that this movie just does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems were in the direction of choices and lack of depth in character formation. The word comedy was very hard to say when I expect these words to laugh. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, both in their mid-30s, seem well adjusted. They meet a completely different person in a park, and Heather Graham walks up to them and asks the most intimate questions that even a half-sensible person would run in the other direction, or at least scream for a policeman. Then he walks over awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and she falls in love with him. Then, after ONE date they all go out together, he falls in love with her and decides to marry in Vegas in a week. Hello someone still feels stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that WE want to see on screen and marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it does not make sense either. Sure, it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it would be possible, but the direction made it completely flat. Now, Heather also falls head over heels with her and as Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more to the point that it was the sloppiest kiss the Chemistry LIKED. I found it unromantic and unsteady, and although many say Heather can not act, I think Heather was the wrong person for that role. <br /> <br /> This was the debut of Sue Kramer as a director and for me it was just too much for her to chew. It would take a lot of crafting to make this movie work, and I think he could handle better writers and casting and directing.
