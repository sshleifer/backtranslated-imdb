I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can not figure out why they bought the rights to this movie. The plot summary says, "But what Satan does not know is that he's got annoying tourists." Well, they did not bother him in the movie, only me about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was just boring.
