In this movie, there are a few things that work immediately. With Dani Filth as the lead actor, some people will automatically like this movie. Granted, I love Cradle of Filth and heard the soundtrack to this movie long before I saw it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and ensures an excellent lead. The film's independent film style is great for the scary factor. There are some great actresses in this movie. The low budget effects were not bad either. The way people died was very creative and nightmarish. Now for the disadvantages. There is VERY little talk about the entire movie, which does not make much sense for character development. It's hard to fear the life of limp, static characters. In a small talk, the F-bomb was abundant and appeared at random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems like a preteen boy wrote this as a script and thought it would be cool to include all languages. The plot I could make of it was pretty good, though many parts are dangling and the lack of conversation leaves you wondering what's going on porn for people who love sex and violence, but like a porn, he tries to pull an action, he just does not work so well. Rent it if you are a morbid person who wants to quench your blood and meat hunger.
