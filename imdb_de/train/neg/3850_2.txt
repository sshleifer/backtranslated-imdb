I saw this movie on SXSW, along with the director. Not a few people went out, and the audience could hardly muster polite applause in the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. With 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. You can watch the failed and extended communication attempts of the main character in real time. The same grimaces, mouth movements, kinetic and desperately repeated words and syllables over and over again - WE GET THE POINT. One site actually compares this work to the early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you need to take to make that statement? Considering the fact that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, you may need to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on strong rotation to appreciate this movie. Unbelievably, this was won by a jury at the festival. You can bet that it won no audience prize.
