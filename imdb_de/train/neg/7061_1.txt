I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point in this movie. <br /> <br /> For content supposedly "rebellious" and "controversial", the things that Maddox distributes to the students are terribly lame. The students seem to be easily influenced by vaguely anti-authoritarian feelings and snippets of words scribbled illegibly on leaflets. Rebel, all together. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been too much to have a teenage rebellion movie in which a school fire alarm is not triggered. <br /> <br /> Apparently a "giant fight on the football fields" is a fight that consists of two people. The characters of the characters seem to vary randomly. A football jock Maddox fought against (and who later had a staple on his face) smiles and apologizes the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that there is no real result of the plot I feel that it could have been done in half an hour after the school special. If they had cut most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
