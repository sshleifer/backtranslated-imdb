There have been a few moments in my life when I was confused and depressed. Sitting by Rancid Aluminum was one of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars did not want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I was watching the movie was in the hope that I could catch some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was explained. The story was idiotic. I cheered at some point when the film's lead role turned up, and to my growing desperation it became apparent that he had not really been shot to quench my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film will be hanged for this cruelty. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mainly inadvertent moments of humor. For example, the scene where the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to manually relieve himself in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel. That's why I'll conclude. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: Only for sadists, pirates and regressives who want to torment themselves.
