This movie is unworthy of the Omen title. It's so bad it actually damaged the classic character of the first three. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> You do not even write Damien Thorn's NAME correctly !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all omen movies. Pull it off the shelves and burn it.
