A handful of critics have rated this movie with positive comments. I do not want to argue with her opinion, but I totally disagree. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing Bruce Lee to other films, especially the late master, I quickly changed my mind. I would never have bought it without the title of the movie. Game of Death 2 does not refer to the original Game of Death (unless it shares a character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see Game of Death 2 compare to Enter the Game dragon. The plot has striking similarities: Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on the mission to avenge a relative. The two places are similar, in which they are very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. In both films, there is an element of prostitution (women are sent to the guestrooms in both films). Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis Henchman lack a hand. It's an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there's one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon. The list will continue. <br /> <br /> In terms of other aspects of the film, such as the script and acting, I thought it was very bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists who would star in the movie and pray that they could act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the combat sequences contain strong elements of acrobatics, they are still cleverly executed. However, since the plot is inadequate, I could not relate to the characters, so the combat sequences were more exhibits than a meaning to the movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would say that this movie should be recommended to all fans of martial arts, but for those who like a solid action movie with a good plot and strong characters, I can not recommend this movie. My views on this film may seem very biased and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpiece Enter the Dragon, the film failed to meet these standards. If anything, they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, the film is rated a very tough 1 in 10, the film is barely visible and must be grateful that he had the combat sequences.
