This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a sexual encounter for one night and explains it as a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues, I felt that only three really did show some kind of truth call. I've always been waiting for the movie to get better, and it took a while, but never enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I wanted it to be good, but it never succeeded. If they really had love stories, it would have worked.
