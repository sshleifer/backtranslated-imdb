It's one of those dramas that are so bad it's almost funny. The script is absolutely dark, the direction is frightening, the lighting is purely armatured. The only thing that makes it so bad of a true is the noise design is just pretty bad; It does not add tension to the story, although it tries hard but at least does not destroy any speeches. There are continuity problems of the seasons of outdoor scenes. And last but not least, acting is appalling. For a professional production, it feels like a university media project that you have to apologize for regretting someone who needs to give that name.
