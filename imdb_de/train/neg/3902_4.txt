This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to be as close as possible to the book. But the spectacle was terrible. Apart from Kate Beckinsale, whom I believe was a true reflection of Emma in the book, all the other actors tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he should be. He was often rude and insulting, had no feeling at all, and throughout the movie you could not see how his love for Emma "grows". This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "streamline" both her lead role and that of her partner. In addition, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Harriet Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real ties to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem so heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are too bad. The costumes are even more so. I could have imagined Emma Woodhouse dressing herself in a more fashionable and elegant way than she does here. The end is too long. It's good that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a killer end for a movie. And again, I do not see a feeling of happiness on Mr.Knightley's face. In conclusion, I believed that this adaptation remains true to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed like the movie was made without a budget at all. I would prefer to see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, even though it's clear that she should be a "blockbuster" than watching these actors (besides the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) all script.
