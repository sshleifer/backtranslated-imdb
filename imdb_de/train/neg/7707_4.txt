With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" Anyone who studies this thing expects either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy that makes fun of bad science fiction movies. It's supposed to be a mixture of both, with a dose of parody squirting in. Unfortunately, she falls off very fast. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I know that, but you should find it funny, right? I found only some of the jokes or situations funny (ie The Side By Side Telephone Conversations, The Russian Olympic Spy Eating Steroid Cereals, Superman Passing Lois, Etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" wants to be a cult classic, but does not make it. A cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" could be enjoyed by every eight-year-old with bad humor and is therefore not a cult movie. <br /> <br /> There's a good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a slender, cruel reporter, but has a lovely personality, loves to exaggerate, and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, she is badly used here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is not as funny as "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but it does. I have some fun moments, so I would anyway recommend to see it once. Avoid the editor's cut, there are interruptions by the producer of the film and allegedly "lost" material that is dubbed in an alleged African dialect (it's on the out of print section in English).
