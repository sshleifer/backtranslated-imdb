Disappointing and unquestionably boring true crime film that has painstakingly scrutinized character actor Jeremy Renner through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was undoubtedly one of the most famous degeneration / serial killers of the last century. "Dahmer," which was released directly on video in early 2003, is a decidedly chatty, boring, malfunctioning and virtually bloodless snoring drama of true crime that never really delves into the monstrous and denied psyche of the mass murderer as if it absolutely did good potential to do that! What he tries to do for unknown reasons, however, is a kind of sympathy for the man in the viewer, portraying him as a lonely, nebbishy and severely socially inappropriate homosexual loser who simply looked. for the love in all wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and corrupted sick and crazy ones he was! All in all, "Dahmer" from 2003 is one that can be skipped well by real criminals everywhere, because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst serial killer biopics ever made! It's even sadder than other pathetic and exploitative rubbish rubbings like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-zero stars)
