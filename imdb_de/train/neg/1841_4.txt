This can be considered in many different ways. This movie is shit, it's good or just funny. The third probably explains this movie best. It has weird themes and just a strange plot. Who else but Christopher Walken would play, no matter how bad, average or even good it is. <br /> <br /> The acting was exactly what one would expect from Ben Stiller. I've always liked Jack Black, so you know what you get from him, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always aloof. He can always look good no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy is a bit strange. This of course means that the movie has its moments (albeit very few), but here and there something can be exaggerated, which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughter, but of course not in a good way <br /> The direction was also average. Barry Levinson is a little overrated director and has not really done a good job here. This movie seemed to have a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach him. Only very average and did not seem to put much effort into the movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously this means that the letter failed here. It is best below average. Considering that it has its moments, it was not too terrible. However, this is never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and it would be stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. In his films, he is always quite a figure. This is just a weird, strange movie with strange characters that really go nowhere. Not terrible, but I would not really recommend it because it is a very memorable movie.
