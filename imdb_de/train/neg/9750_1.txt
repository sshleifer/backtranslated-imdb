The film, a universal publication of a Protelco MLC production, is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking up the molecular structure of an object, capturing it as "pure energy" in a cell and then sending it completely "backwards". Target area. "There is no explanation why this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by punk-nosed actor Bryant Haliday," Devil Doll ") thinks it's something his, and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach ) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), live up to. <br /> <br /> During an experiment in front of the well-known Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine is turned off due to sabotage, leaving his secretary behind Sheila (Tracey Crisp) lets herself be "avenged" to take revenge, of course she messes up and he looks like a "roast pork" with the power to kill people. <br /> <br /> With this new power he creates zapping some Cockney idiots, a security guard named Latham (Derrick de Marney), and his lab boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland), who is also able to break into a pharmacy and a pair of rubber gloves and a pair of rubber gloves to steal a black coat. <br /> <br /> Despite Hill and Mitchell's attempts to help him, the clown finally destroys his gear and himself. All in all, a completely meaningless film without any news. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color films you'll ever see.
