SPOILERS IN <br /> <br /> My high school did everything to try to motivate us for exams. The most memorable way to put us in the right mood was to be a guest speaker who was none other than the favorite son of the Australian kickboxer, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this man a microphone because he screamed half the time, even though we were not more than three to four meters away from him. Well, his speech was full of the usual "If you do not prepare, then prepare for failure", but there have been several cases where I was really upset. The guy stood in front of us preaching how he has done everything in his life for himself and no one else. In the past, he was offered many offers to give up kickboxing, but he had never looked to become Australia's biggest kickboxer. He said that he was not a clearance sale, he was happy and a retiree, he was never involved in activities other than kickboxing. then he pocketed his movie. Yes, you heard right, he stopped his new movie. As he talked about it, he got a woman to come in and throw up a poster advertising it, and then he showed that crappy 4-minute clip of that vile movie titled "Trojan Warrior." (All this before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last career fight.) Stan plays Ajax, a kickboxing ex-special force pulled into the dodgy underworld Melbourne Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold (well, at least remotely Stan is not too far from ALL) to the US government and is therefore on the run from all organized crime. Ajax and Theo fall into all sorts of ridiculous situations, from fights in a kebab shop to playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein wanted to make a credible movie here, that man should never get a camera again. <br /> <br /> I admit, I was really excited to see that. I love action movies, even if they are crazy and especially if they play in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a movie with acting that was off-putting from the word "go" and after the words "For God's love please stop!", Subplots were introduced and not even touched once they were out in the open The characters were simply thrown out for no reason, and the overly choreographed fight scenes that did not even remotely reflect Stan's actual kickboxing talent. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about everyone who was famous for REMOTELY (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). The whole time you sit there and play the guessing game, who is just there in the background. Too bad that the film relies heavily on second appearances of former celebrities. Do you remember the storylines that I told you about? In the past, Ajax was apparently imprisoned and wrongfully charged with the murder of his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in a special unit about ONE sentence in the WHOLE film, and then left it to the misleading. This is followed by another SINGLE phrase that causes Ajax to help the same people who wrongfully imprisoned him. In the end, Ajax realizes that his wife is not really dead, but was sold to prostitution. Let's see her no. Does Ajax find her as soon as he hears that? Well, that's a marriage! <br /> <br /> Amidst this irritating puerile crap, this movie was featured on a website as "A cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??" described. Has this man ever sat down and watched a movie by Jackie Chan ?! Chan shows more dexterity than doing a dump than Stan did. Well, EVERYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime-messiah, and you compare him to Salik Silverstein !? This movie is more of a mix of "pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Well, where does the "Trojan Warrior" title come from? Ajax's hard martial arts like those of an ancient Greek warrior? No. The gangster gang to find Theo, like the Trojan Empire? No, is it? wait for that ?? Theo carries a condom around with him. Yes, that's right, because THEO is ALWAYS prepared with a Trojan MARK RUBBER in his pocket. He is a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I had the annoyance to see "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip for "Chop Chop", a rap song by Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper did this to prove that ANYONE can rap. The funny thing was that Chopper was rattled for just 30 seconds and then thrown to these two albino teenagers by Doncaster. In their Australian accents words such as "dis" and "dope" etc. were used. Face it people, rap was developed in the States, LET THERE THERE! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman had put together on ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidi's Kickboxing Featurette: This was not too bad considering that there were only 6 or 7 different fights from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall about 15 times in this 3-minute montage ) /> <br /> I do not want to say that this movie is helping this country go to hell when it comes to film, but ... oh, I just did it. My advice to anyone reading this is that you buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", glue them together, and use them for a paperweight, because this movie is so damn bad.
