First, there are a few good things about this movie, but it's all clich√© slasher stuff in conjunction with a teen movie. In the commercial for this movie I've seen, there's a lot of emphasis on Denise Richards being there, but she's a poor actress and does not look as good as people want her (not that) to do anything with the movie. And how does she look like that? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, the acting ... Nevertheless, the writing is fine. You know who this is all over the movie, and you can almost predict what's going to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good judging by the plot, but next time I'll read it to find out instead of seeing it.
