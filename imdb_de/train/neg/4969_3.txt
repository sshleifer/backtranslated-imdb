For starters, this is not nearly as bad as the rest of the sci-fi channel. That does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact he is very bad, but he definitely had the potential to be much better. The shortcomings of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music and, for the most part, the acting. <br /> <br /> When talking about character design, of course I have what our heroes and villains look like. Beowulf and the other Danes look like ridiculous Vikings, not warriors of raw strength - this helmet worn by our main protagonist is simply too stupid. Grendel looks like the Hulk, but has strange tentacle appendages on the elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from beginning to end, but Finn - a useless buddy - achieved a certain two-dimensionality thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also gets a hunch that he is less conceited. <br /> <br Just like Finn, there are pointless additions to this story to make it their own while still clinging to the source material. The crossbow that Beowulf is gifted with is so ridiculous that I'm surprised the actor did not leave the set. In addition to additions, there are omissions such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terribly awful. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly designed and therefore less believable on screen. <br /> <br /> The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst movie ever by Sci-Fi. No, it's actually one of the better movies, though garbage is still that, it's good garbage that at best makes a bad treat. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still made of wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I urge you to skip this movie and see Robert Zemeckis' attitude to the old story of Beowulf, Grendel) is only half the story and not the whole thing that makes this film a Star rating brings in.
