This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad spectacle, bad script, all bad. A comparison with mainly two other films from the same genre and about the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem to be more robust in both history and direction, and yet it is Albert Pyun, who also directed these two directors, is history not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental catastrophe or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special kind of robot (cyborg) lives on human blood and there is history ... The cyborgs have to make many people fulfill their "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. A girl along with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs was destined to save humanity. In this film, the director and the participants try to fly some stylish fighting scenes from Hong Kong high and jump far. The film fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people will get a new "worst" movie that they can relate to. And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg," because I think it's a very underrated movie with a pretty high entertainment factor. And if you do not like Van Damme, then look at "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
