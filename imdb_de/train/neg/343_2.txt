The truly wonderful Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wondering Rosanna Arquette, plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few years before the "action" the child murdered her father and his mother the fall for the offspring. Now she's moved to the northwestern US to start over again, but her child still has a problem because she's dedicated to her mother. So faithful that it kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their bond. Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as a daughter) kills more than humans - she delivers such a horrible performance that she also wipes out of the film, though the incoherent script, the useless directing and the horrific music (the Saxophone the first time she shows her bikini-clad body), nothing help; We're supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both counts. Almost completely uninteresting and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer do not really convince as a mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, both of whom are far more valuable (especially Rosanna) are the only sensible reasons to sit down through this Farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour "Love", Lies and Murder "(by Two Short Productions), was there such a" you joke "credit.
