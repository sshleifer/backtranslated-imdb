Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why should you watch this movie again? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top-secret military officials discover the deadly (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters that run around and kill people in gory ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. This is somewhere in between, although it is not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. EVALUATION: 2 out of 10 points. R rated for violence and violence, gruesome imagery and obscenity.
