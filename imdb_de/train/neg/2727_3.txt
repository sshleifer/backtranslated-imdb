This curiosity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not necessarily have to be taken into account as it only takes less than 30 minutes in the film. What she does, however, is brilliant when she's on the screen. The movie with no plot less is just an excuse to introduce some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promises and it's a shame she did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the "get-getter" with flying colors. Better if this was in color. The locations of the Travis Air Force Base with some rear projection work well. The best thing about the film are wonderful musical deposits. If you like THANK YOU HAPPY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you will like it.
