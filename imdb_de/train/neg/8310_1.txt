Another huge conspiracy film that tries to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for any disaster since the flood. Anyone who has ever served in the US military can see how fake this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and behaviors are all wrong. (And of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Obvious propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted in recent years. Uses every clich√©, rumor, and urban legend from the Gulf - everything is portrayed as gospel. (The truth is, nobody knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy than horses.) PS This is not new. War is no fun and I know veterinarians from World War II, from Korea and Vietnam with quite serious complaints. (And the government has a responsibility to take care of everyone.) Sensational films like these will not solve the problem!
