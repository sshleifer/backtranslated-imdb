No word can describe my absolute hatred for this appalling depiction of the BTK killer. This film is celebrated by every tenth film as a compliment to this truly catastrophic apology. From start to finish, there was not a single highlight. The whole thing was horribly put together; the script, drama, plot, lighting, directing, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A series of scenes are in the truest sense of the word funny, funny for the hideous way in which the whole thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and devastating attack on a low budget movie. This is not the case. If I just think about the movie I just saw, my blood starts to boil. I NEVER know how this film ever received rights for the production. I'm almost tempted to actually recommend BTK because it's really remarkable how pathetically and worryingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of filming, this is the BADEST. MOVIE. JE. I wasted over an hour of my life for this useless garbage and would have liked to jump from the nearest building if I had known what I wanted. Zero out of the ten.
