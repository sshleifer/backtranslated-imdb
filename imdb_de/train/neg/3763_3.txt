A group of forest guards and scientists go into the forest to search for fossils. They eventually stumble upon a Bigfoot burial ground (they did not notice it in the dark), saying they rarely dot. I used to think that maybe there is a good bigfoot movie. But now, after so many sad films about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour salt into the film's wound, the EINSTE-looking girl does not even get naked. And although this may be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (not a bad performance), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains "Harry and the Henriksons". <br /> <br /> My grade: D
