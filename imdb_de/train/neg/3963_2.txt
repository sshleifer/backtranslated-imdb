How many crazy times do we have to see a haunting passing in the background and sharpening through the reflection of a mirror? It's been done in two dozen recent films and four dozen times in this choppy, bad-tempered movie. There were only two crazy moments to appreciate ... as the spirits invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the drama was as shallow as the Diet Coke in the 64 oz. Cup I drew it from. The minor characters may have been drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the friendly old sheriff. In the backwoods, the crazy nutcracker lived on the Alabama train. Many characters without development. The most disturbing picture was that of a murdered child at the beginning. But instead of exploring the murder of a child, which would have been interesting, they simply tell us that she is dead and her parents have had difficulties reconciling her death with the community and the other. When they reached the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together ... with flashing images of the dead daughter inserted here and there. Oh ... and the eerie sounds were overkill too. You know what I mean ... creaking doors that open by themselves, barbecues in the woods, Yada Yada Yada. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen that yet. Again, you see the amazing, self-opening door in the movie over and over again. Note to the director: A scary scene is just scary if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before saying, "It's a wrap!"
