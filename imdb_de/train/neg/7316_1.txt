When I saw the previews for this movie, I did not expect much of a start - a second-rate teenage horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely terrible. And that is generous. <br /> <br /> At first the casting was awful for the movie. They have no sympathy (or even a morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I just waited for it and hoped the terrible thing would end. <br /> <br /> Second, there are points in the movie that have absolutely nothing to do with the storyline. Can someone please explain to me why the girly-looking boy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs while I went into Jackie Chan moves that I've never seen before, and still further bite the guy who has the virus? Why is the child's father getting upset with the guy who's been infected with the virus and going for a redneck hunt to find him? I had the feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said aloud, "Where the hell did that come from?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I had seen. I really thought I saw some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever surpasses them all. This movie has made me puke again and then puke again. Then blow my head out. <br /> <br /> Please save an hour and a half and do something more productive. The growth of grass is perhaps a good alternative.
