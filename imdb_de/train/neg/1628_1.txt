Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems to REALLY want to be something important. The tragic truth is that at every level it's so worthless that you can not help but laugh. Desperate for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, it follows the day of a wilderness city couple ... they walk down a shady path as they become like a U.C. Berkeley Coffee Clatch. Almost every line of the tarradiddle dialogue that comes in here is excitingly bad ("I feel like life itself is made up of so many tiny compartments like this pomegranate ... but is it so beautiful?") Then one seems Eternal to be nothing (well ... OK ... we are treated to some nudity and a lukewarm sex scene), finally there is a VERY anti-climactic confrontation where a couple of Nam vets make up the nature scene and some pretty tough folk Ballads play with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing eventful or interesting happens in this entire film. I found the Larry Buchanan picture "Strawberries Need Rain" a weak example of a Bergman homage. "Golden Apples" is just as bad, but the incessant random words it presents make it terribly awful. 1.10
