This "movie" is one of the most horrible things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent brew. <br /> <br /> The camera shake and your actors have "dark" is not considered the "direction" that this film in droves needed. Not that the writing was all that wonderful, but we had a lot of totally artificial characters that were directed in the most artificial way (the pseudo documentary "style" appreciated by those who do not know how to direct). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it was made cynical to appeal to critics who do not know firsthand what filmmaking (what most of them are) knows. <br /> <br /> Just awful. It says a lot about Sundance and what Victor Vargas showed there.
