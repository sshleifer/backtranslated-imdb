... not to live in Montana and especially not to live at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river flows through it" is certainly a well-made film from a cinematic point of view. Great scenery, Redford behaves well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the story is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the narrator / writer who does it as dry, narrow-minded as his father, a preacher. If he is driven and does not drive his own life, he has to watch his brother, who is also locked up in the vicinity of a small town and loses his life. The author never comes close to his brother's motives, but at least he realizes he lacks the slightest amount of homo / fun. All there is is fly-fishing, where even as an old man he follows his father's style. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is foreseeable from the outset. Definitely not a must (3/10) <br /> <br />
