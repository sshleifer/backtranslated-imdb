I have not read a negative professional review of this movie. I think I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and talk to fictional stories. This is the best. After the three have separated, the film divides into three threads. Then boredom sets in. Certainly, the thread with the Felliniesque Babushkas, who make dolls out of chewed bread, is initially a wake-up call. Unfortunately, the director has beaten this to death and even injected a wild plot line that leads nowhere particularly. Conclusion: a two-hour plotless relentlessness. If you suffer from insomnia, look in bed and you have a good night's sleep.
