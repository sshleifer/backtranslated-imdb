Was it a premonition when Tori complained that her first friend treated her like a robot and then turned out to be her new friend (the murderer) as a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes where you squeal for joy: montages galore, montages galore, a striptease in a kimono (what do you call it when you dress seductively instead of taking it off?) And a battle on skis! Definitely adjust to the beginning and the end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act when the entire presentation takes place. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah Will Tori ever make it to paradise or even out of the snow? Nope.
