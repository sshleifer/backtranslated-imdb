Isabel Allende's magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The cumbersome film of a movie that resulted mainly from a great cast of Anglo actors who could not tolerate the evasive Latin mildness of the Allenden characters and a criminal Scandinavian director's hand was so disagreeable in their skin that I came back for a second To the theater to make sure I did not miss anything important that might change my mind. To my disappointment, I had missed nothing. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave were able to free themselves from the trap that director Bille August had set for them. They all looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if trying to go unnoticed by fading into beautiful periodicals, they made as little effort as possible. (Yes, the movie was just an inch of his life.) Curious that the production designer was allowed to prominently place KFC products in a scene that emerged around 1970 - years before KFC was founded. At that time it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even if pardoned, what is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in 1970 in a military dictatorship in South America? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. "The House of Ghosts" was supposed to have been the movie event of 1993. Because it remained so clumsily and slavishly faithful to his vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And that's why Isabel Allende has been charged with rape.
