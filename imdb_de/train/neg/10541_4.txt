Here are a few notes on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990s satanic serial killer yuppie hellfest ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently charged with beating his wife could spend time in jail. I just hope he can find Armani prison clothes that he can express himself in style: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is that he dresses his cop in $ 4,500 designer coats, a $ 7300 designer silk suit, and a $ 3500 a month in Los Angeles wearing bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) Leady Lady Tracey Phillips has a beautiful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems styled even when shelled, and amazing breasts that are brightly lit in the second half of the movie from a designer silk sweater who remains sadly over her torso, even if she was ready to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic murderers took off their victims before they were abolished, even though there is something to be said when one leaves something to the imagination. In the last 10 minutes of the movie, all I could think about was how her breasts would look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychiatrists living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide he did put to the test. In fact, the condominium used in this film looks exactly like David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR. Who at least had the good feeling of making her Condo resident a successful film director. The only professional psychologists I met outside of this film are currently all those sentenced to prison for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forget his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his "How are you?" 'Buddy boy? "Row could be the best-missed movie phrase ever since" THANK YOU FOR DRIVING, LADY !! "by CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Among the major cities, there are huge vats of boiling acid that are in huge Fireballs will explode if someone throws an illuminated Zippo lighter into them, which is why all major public waterworks do so No smoking signs plastered themselves everywhere, although the notion of smoking near water is of course absurd, and there Zippo lighters are manual To fill them with light liquid that can often leak out and be absorbed by clothing, the idea of ​​wearing them in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk suit seems a lot more dangerous to me. <BR> <br /> 6) The stunts in this Film is impressive, to say the least, and one of the fun things you can see is that you do not look at computerized special effects, but real St Untmenschen, which contribute with life and limb to make a contribution A film, which received nearly universal BOMB evaluations with the publication of critics. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie Satanists are always amazing: Here's a guy who took a Luciferic bid for power instead of using it Do something useful by getting rich or making you that models move with him in the form of free sex. Instead, he owns bag ladies and lets them float outside people's homes. Speaking of which here is a man who is indestructible, who can fly and put his nature into the bodies of other people - and yet he obliges the star Lou Diamond Phillips with a usual fist fight in the conclusion of the film, but does not have the It makes sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And on and on ... To be watched while drinking beer by smart friends. You will have fun as long as you refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
