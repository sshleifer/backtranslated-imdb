Annie Potts is the only highlight in this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenage who is really upset that someone stole the Corvette that he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (probably the ugliest car in a movie), and he goes after Annie Las Vegas to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have pulled my eyes out after watching if it would not have been fun to see Annie Potts in a very early role, and that too bad for Hamill that he did not have a few acting lessons you took. Danny Bonaduce also makes a silly cameo.
