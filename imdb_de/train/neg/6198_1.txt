This cowardly and insulting movie fascinated me at first. The characters are the familiar, expropriated young men who often hang around bored in a coastal town on the beach. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and goes in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the movie as a wanton rapist. One wonders how much experience this young director has in real life. Nobody can save poor Robert. Clay leaves the news that young British men are getting out of hand. A very unobtrusive connection exists to the Iraqi insurgents. During the unnecessarily graphic rape, we are exposed to explosions and war images. The film shows that the extremism of the male peer group is reaching its limits. The young bombers in London paint a parallel to Clay's hateful portrayal of the modern man. Clay implies that men simply can not resist committing terrible acts of violence. It is a miracle that the British film industry is investing money in films that propagate such a split, while in London we are still distracting from the recent attacks. This is Lehm's first film, I would be happy if it's his last.
