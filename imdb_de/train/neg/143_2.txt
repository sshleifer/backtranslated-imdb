In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre taken away by parodies like Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new, and went beyond anything ever done. Why did you like Scream? Because it made sense at least. Valentine is just a stupid Slasher movie that has almost no Gore. The plot is so much like Halloween and Urban Legend that it's not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, it's just predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD. Here we go! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10 points
