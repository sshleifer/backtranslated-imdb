This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "just like the people in the Ohio Valley!" I come from the area and experienced the movie as "So people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there minimum wages. We laughed a lot, we got together and took breaks with people of our age; The young people went out together at night. The elderly had little free time after work because they cared for their families. The area is beautiful in summer and not darker in winter than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Apart from the claim "If you live in a prefabricated house, you have to be depressed" charm, mystery or even a feeling of fear. Martha's character was the worst. It is doubtful that someone so oppressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she would probably have made friends there. I've read reviews that suggest Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner," but if that's the case, it's not shown. All we actually see is that for reasons that would apply in the same way, if the three friends had the same age and sex, Martha Rose did not learn to like Rose. We see how Martha feels excluded during smoking sessions when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally respected and violated. <br /> <br /> Just one more thing: do you suspect Kyle of murder because he once had some panic attacks? You're welcome. This brings the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
