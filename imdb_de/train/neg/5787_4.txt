As for HEIST movies, this movie is pretty weak. Continuity is pretty lousy, there is not enough continuity of character to really feel like one of the characters. Peter Falk is great and he is one of the reasons why it is worth seeing. Falk has some great lines like "he'll be right back, he buys a couple of saugages" or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, though they are all down to the actors' efforts. Direction, script and editing are pretty bad.
