As the general core of these comments seems to be, the movie has some awesome animations (I've seen it on Blu-ray), but it's really not as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are all pretty blunt. I have an indication of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main opponent Shunack. But maybe my mind wandered and that was wishful thinking (Laputa is my favorite animé, original Engilsh-Dub). The characters are also not really endearing and as mentioned in another post, they fall in love very quickly and leave poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who does not seem to notice). However, in the end, she seems to forgive Toola without any explanation for the change of heart, as the ending becomes a bit "happier." <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanations. How are the druids really? Are these people? and who are the strange women / girls who hang around with them and lead the forest? Nothing explains why they are there and how they can give superpowers to regular people. The plants coming from the moon do not fill in the gaps yet. It's almost like a funny version of The Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? Why bother if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to have this movie, but I did not find the plot as close as a movie like Ghost in Shell or a real character like this one from Miyazaki. I'm not annoyed when I look, but I wish I had not bought it. My advice? Try it if you have a few hours, but borrow it or buy it cheap! You may like it if your new Animé films are not very busy. It is certainly visually appealing.
