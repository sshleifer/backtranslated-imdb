This film is about World War II British prisoners of war who fled a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "The Wooden Horse" disappointingly boring. The theme could have been exciting, thrilling and adrenaline-laden, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and ill-told events without suspension and thrills. The first half clearly shows how prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so simple that there are not enough mistakes and shaving to annoy me. The last half of the movie is even worse, they just move from one place to another without being tracked by cat and mouse. And could the characters talk a little less and have more action in an action movie? I am disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", it was the potential to become a great movie.
