Return to the hut by the lake, only ... it was missing. It must have been a very small budget, as a significant portion of the film must have been filmed with a regular video camera. In the same scene, there are some camera shots in film quality and simple video cameras. It makes a very strange mix! I think they had to find a way not to do the effect of the "home video"! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth it to see IF you've seen the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL yet, you never want to see it when you first see it! It will probably seem far too cheesy and will keep you from worrying about the original.
