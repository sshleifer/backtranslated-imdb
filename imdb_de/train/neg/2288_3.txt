Who is Bettieseite? I certainly did not find out when I saw this movie. As I learned from other sources, Ms. Page was in high demand as a queen of "naughty" images in the postwar period, and that is exactly what this film shows. But I never met Bettie. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian education and a dirty domestic life that is only hinted at. The film glosses over their personal lives and is based entirely on the purpose of the film, the "cheeky" images. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames, but Bettie in her pointed bras, Bettie in her belt and stockings, Bettie in bondage ... and so on. Every visit to Ms. Page in Miami Beach turns the film from black and white to color. Then we go back to their gray shadows in New York. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the closest young ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie confides to a friend that she failed to be a high school graduate by receiving an A instead of an A, one can only assume that only two students were in her senior year. The most interesting part of this movie is how weird "cheeky" photos by Ms. Page appear in 2007. It's really sad that a woman spitted on a spit like a pig would not even hit My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written badly or if a crazy editor cut the thing to pieces. I would only recommend it as a source for people who are engaged in the history of unusual underwear.
