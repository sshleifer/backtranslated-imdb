Take "Rambo", get involved in "Miami Vice", cut the budget to about 80%, and you have something a couple of ten year old boys could have if they have a large enough garden and too much access "Penthouse". The cop and ex-command McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as bleak as they come), is recruited to get an American supertank that was stolen and stashed in Mexico. Captured with the tank were hard-bitten Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love Devon (wing), the officer-in-charge, and now meat for the corrupt terrorists / spies / drug dealers who have no decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with spoiled sex, there is action and little sex. The joke is that McBain is shot and survived all the time, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently the authors did not see "The Magnificent Seven" and did not even think to give McBain an air of intelligence. Even for a budget activist, production values ​​are poor, with distance shots during dialogue and very little movement. The mainstay, the tank, is stupid enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who may have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!), Needs to move from fear to ass and butt immediately from simpering. Jones, who has starred in an amazing series of films, is doing pretty well down here. Both he and Busey probably only had some money and a few laughs. Look for talented future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," Once Upon a Time in Mexico) in a stereotypical, menacing part. Even boring for a bad pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still loud enough to play when you leave your house.
