I did not expect much, but I was still disappointed. This was my worst Halestorm production I've seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just chuckled at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a weird gag to see a fat guy eat donuts and fall down again and again? What happened to the caretaker in the sky scene? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but that did not work. They must have spent the entire budget on having "known" actors appear because there is no lighting budget. It looked like it had been shot on a video camera, and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it really take so much movie to show someone how he actually shoots and makes a basket instead of cutting and processing a ball that flits through a basket? I try not to be too critical of low-budget comedy, but if you want to see something fun go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie.
