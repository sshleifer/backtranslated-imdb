Unusual? Yes! Unusual setting for an American war movie, New Zealand. Unusual theme, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one who lived the illegitimate child of the dead son of a senator, to another who lived with seven marines (one after the other) before returning from their returning New Zealand prisoner of war husband His unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me" was murdered. <br /> <br /> Unusual for two fine "stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons to leave so little of themselves in a movie. <br /> <br /> Unusual that I could bother to write a report about such a bad movie, miss it!
