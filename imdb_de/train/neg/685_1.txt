My wife and I were of the opinion that the film with this cast and the director should at least be worth seeing. We were wrong. In fact, we gave it up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young, and Tone are British, but with American accents, was impossible for me to get past - hard to believe that this is England when no one speaks British accents. There is no chemistry between Crawford and everyone, and to repeat a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for no reason is ridiculous. There's no need to worry about one of the characters, so we threw in the towel halfway. It was hard for me to believe that Hawks regulated this because none of the actors spoke Hawksian Rat-a-Tat delivery. So save your time and skip it.
