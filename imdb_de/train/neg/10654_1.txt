Big hair, big breasts, bad music and a huge safety pin ... those are the words that best describe this horrible movie. I love kitschy horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but that had to be one of the worst ever made. The plot is paper thin and ridiculous, acting is an abomination, the screenplay is utterly ridiculous (best of all is the end of showdown with the cops and how he figured out who the killer is - it's just so damn terribly written) that Clothes are disgusting and funny to the same extent, the hair is big, many breasts bounce, men wear cut-off T-shirts that bring out their stomach (disgusting that men have actually worn them !!) and the music is just one Synthesizer trash that goes on and off over and over again ... in almost every scene there is trashy music, breasts and paramedics taking away bodies ... and the gym still does not close for bereavement !! Apart from the joke, this is a really bad movie whose only charm is to look back on the catastrophe of the 80s and have a good old laugh about how bad everything was back then.
