This movie offers NOTHING for everyone. It does not succeed on any level. Acting is a terrible, boring dribble. Obviously, at the end of the sex scene, they tried to be shocking, but in the end they were a parody of what the movie was aiming for. Complete trash, I can not believe what a ridiculous movie that was. <br /> <br /> And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie because she thought that was her disgusting Indi hit, a stunning NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will stick to this movie because the movie is like an uninteresting episode of the OK or something to youngsters. Pathetic.
