Drilled out of the sky, a group of horny naked female angels (with large plastic teeth) have settled in a spooky forest where they feed on unhappy souls who should pass by. It does not take long for a group of friends to fall prey to bloodthirsty women on a road trip? Forest of the Damned is an independent low-budget horror made in the UK. He takes on an interesting premise and flushes it down with the worst spectacles, effects, and directions I've seen in a long time. Director John Roberts occasionally shows a flair behind the camera? The scenes in the rundown house are pretty tense and there are some skilful "shocks" - but the movie is technically amateurish for the most part. Do some really horrible performances of the horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a really bad movie in hand female nudity for the guys to enjoy, but most will find it hard to prevail.
