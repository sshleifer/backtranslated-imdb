That's why many people remain homeless. , , dumb producers pay their money to make awesome movies like this instead of donating if they can bother! Little Man has a lame apology for raising a little dwarf as a baby. The story is terrible, considering it was written by six people. The idea would not be so bad if it was original and not a rip off of a comic episode. It has fun moments, but some of them have gone too far and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. That was the direction. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. it is racist and very unresponsive to midgets. I mean, instead of showing sympathy, the filmmakers make fun of it! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see dwarfs like babies. And for a character who is a dwarf pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a particular family. That's her lame excuse to show that. It just was not worth it. Do not look at this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
