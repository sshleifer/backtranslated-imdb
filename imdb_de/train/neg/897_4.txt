Two years before writing and directing "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a small hit with his screenplay for this strange vehicle for Henry Winkler, then "TV" The Fonz. A 1950's college thespian (and all-around fool) turns to a wife and marries on the horizon with no prospect of employment. To make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling and eventually becomes a "Gorgeous George" -like celebrity. Turning the likable Winkler into a disgusting mockery at the time probably sounded like an interesting idea (and a sure way to separate it from his TV alter ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong and mean, rather out of place staged by director Carl Reiner. It is especially rough when Herv√© Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") bets on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As Henry's lover, Kim Darby seems a little out of her element - especially when surrounded by all those TV hams - which makes the romantic aspect of the script irrelevant. * 1/2 of ****
