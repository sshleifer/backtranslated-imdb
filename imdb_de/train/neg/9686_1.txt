Author and director Peter Greenaway cemented his title as Supreme Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-lust, 8 ½ women. The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their joint quest for sexual satisfaction as they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) into their personal concubine collection. This premise could be offensive and chances are good that Greenaway will has achieved. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes in which the two protagonists can participate. There's the kabuki obsessed Mio, the always pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who has something for livestock. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she is the "half woman", you understand? Greenaway vehemently denies all allegations of misogyny, but if that is not the case then what is? worthy (but less sexist) film from 1996, The Pillow Book. But where the pillow book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ Women is just getting horny and exploitative. Greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in her fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy it is the author himself.
