The longer this movie lasted - and it seemed to be boring forever - the more annoying I became, quite frankly, what a waste of time to get through all this nonsense. How on earth can people make such films, or do they get the funding for this garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings of IMDb, because it only proves that you can constantly deceive some of the people. And in this picture, the main actors have a passion for weapons, so it's not hard to figure out how this movie will ultimately evolve. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the US has such an obscene and deadly "weapons culture." <br /> <br /> However: <br /> <br /> The lead actor portrays a loser fleeing into a fantasy world to be a cowboy in an urban sprawl. a young girl and a boy; is cared for by a strict single parent father who barely copes. The cowboy is seduced by the teenager or vice versa, and the impressive boy seems to be struck by the madness of the loser. The cowboy spends all the time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser, who prefers to go to the beach to live there, and then makes a break-in to his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br Who would either like to see a sad, failed loser in a fantasy world with a death wish or actually see a poor family that is actually not much better off whiter Garbage is? This movie is pointless drivel. <br /> <br /> It only spares you to get the lowest note in front of the half audible music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
