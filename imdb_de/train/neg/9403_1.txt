This movie should not be classified as a movie. Although it is now over 10 years old, it should never have received funding and is a failure of the Australian film industry, which now produces such brilliant films as "The Dish". The Actors can not act, the music is dull, not the music, the plot does not exist and it's hard to get through. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie. It is a complete waste of time.
