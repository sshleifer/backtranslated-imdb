T. Rama Rao made some very nice movies in the 80s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not ripen with the changing times, styles and fashions. He is like the old movie style. <br/> <br /> Actors are not bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor usually behaves convincingly with his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look weird and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she's always good and here she is no more than that. She makes the most of what she's got, but she always does. In the end, nothing good. Raveena is fine, which is ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic and occasionally stupid. Maybe it's a late movie? Well, even then it would be below standard. The script is awful, the movie is over the top and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a movie from the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is the main actor from the 1950s.
