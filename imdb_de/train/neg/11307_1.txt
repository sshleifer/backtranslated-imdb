The completely stupid weapon. I think the guys who danced at the beginning of a movie by Steven Segal were going to mock Jeff with his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The storyline is predictable, the fights are fair, and Jeff acts just as much as the sofa he beats with a kind of weapon in a scene.
