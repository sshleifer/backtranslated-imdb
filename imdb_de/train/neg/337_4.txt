What can I say? THE GOLDEN CHILD falls into the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has weird (and sometimes pretty annoying lines) but you're still entertained. Chales Dance has never been so bad as his role as villain Sardo Numspa (what's that damn name?). Who should see the golden kid ... hm ... hard to say, but my best guess would be people who like embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad action, and even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
