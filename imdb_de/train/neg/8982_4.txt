My nose is slightly bent as I write this. I had a few weeks ago sent a previous comment on this film, which has not yet appeared. I assume that he was rejected even though he fulfilled all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, an experienced actor who has appeared in major productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, everything is sinking under the weight of a really horrible, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of superfluous nudity that does nothing to spur on the narration or even give an impressionistic nuance, which is otherwise a beautifully filmed artwork. Be much less exhausting than hitting those fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
