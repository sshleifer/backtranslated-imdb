This was the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinemas. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People hit in the head are not funny. The people who are kicked are not funny. After the third time, a man was kicked and not even the youngest crowd laughed anymore. It got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs about King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I am not suprised. The story is pretty lame. A dwarf thief steals a big diamond in the definitely simplest robbery in Hollywood history. Then he hides with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines again and again for 1.5 hours and you will get a picture. There were predictable jokes galore. I really felt torn off after seeing this. I did not expect much and was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next screenplay. That was even worse than White Chicks, if that's possible. I have seen high school plays that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like it when my conversation is suppressed.
