George P. Cosmato's "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is a pure wish fulfillment. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They've done more to this country than imaginable damage, and this movie continues the tales of the oh-so-innocent soldier. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war possible. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice. He is extremely patriotic and complains that Americans have not appreciated and celebrated the successes of the individual soldier, but has only mistrust of senior officers and politicians. Like any film that defends the war (eg, "We Were Soldiers"), it also avoids the need to give a clear reason for engaging in South Asia. And also the reason for every single American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo has to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work with the memories instead of suppressing them. "Can we win this time?" Yes you do.
