As a former submarine, this was one of the worst submarine movies I have ever seen. First, a mutiny aboard a US Navy ship, especially a submarine with nuclear propulsion and Trident, unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is great and they take the whole way from the captain to the youngest crew member very seriously. I could never see a crew of a ship splitting their alliance between the captain and the executive officer. An executive officer, acting as the character played by Denzel Washington, was released from his duties, and Court Martialed was then drummed by the Navy. It's no surprise that the Navy refused to send in a technical advisor to make this film. If a member of a submarine crew made the sounds that were traveling on that ship, they would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid discovery. They do not close any doors and even speak quietly and wear soft-soled shoes on the way. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew during the trip. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know the U-boat portraits would not actually sell movie tickets, but that's overkill until it's ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
