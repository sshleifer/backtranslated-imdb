... otherwise nobody will watch the movie. My husband and I saw it last night. It's just a small theater, but usually there is a decent number of people. Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people to see Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The drama, script, dialogue, directing, editing etc. was terrible! Since we were alone in the room, we had during the movie free entertainment. That said, we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of the powerful Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND Lord of the Rings. It was as if we expected Rita and Lord Zed to be commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not just introduce legions of Dino / Dragon / Lizard things that are loaded with cannon without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide range of characters, but he introduces them to 3 films and develops them, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The scene transitions are terrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but although it was too easy an action, I lost myself in the action holes. The characters were Caucasian Americans, but spoke almost broken English because of the poorly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The last scene that could have used a value in the movie ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... although he had not known her long in this life anyway. He did not seem too excited to be left in "Mordor," not knowing where he was or how he should come back. We could not find out for God's sake where he was or how he got there, but if he does not get upset we should not be. Oh, and why did the dress get dressed? That Sarah's gaze wore a look like she'd borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all three main hero characters were reincarnations that were brought back to finish the job. Sarah does her job and goes to the afterlife. Jack does that too. Why is Ethan screwed then? He is alone, without the girl, without map / compass / helicopter, to help him come back. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And when he comes home, does he just return to his job? He would have had the same grace to be killed out of the movie as the other heroes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money on this movie. We only stayed until the end, because we paid for it, but as soon as the credits were reached, we were out the door.
