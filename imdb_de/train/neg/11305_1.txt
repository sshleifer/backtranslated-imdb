This is a very bad West, especially because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like he was shot dead on a background in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, in Idaho, the Colorado Territories, and Montana. It fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is terrible; There is very little direction and bad action. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good superintendent. He was feared by his locals for his hard drinking. When he was drunk, he started fighting and other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To make sure he could never terrorize her again, Jack Slade, after ignoring their warning, galked out of the city immediately. This is a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie, except to see how Hollywood burdens the story at will to this day.
