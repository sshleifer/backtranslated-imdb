"Anita and Me" is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic Britain, more like "Bend it Like Beckham" or more precisely, "East is East", with which it shares a setting of the 70s. The sound is decidedly chirpy (despite the bleak Black Country accents), but the film lacks the Eastern East, the power of the East, and the result is rather thin and banal. Moreover, the portrayal of the movie's central relationship between an Asian girl and his white friend is not enough deep enough to justify the structure of the film around him. I also got tired of movies in which the hero has become a writer for years. Of course, this is often something real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; "Anita and Me" seems obvious and boring in comparison.
