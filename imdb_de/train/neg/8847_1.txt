This US soap opera "Knots Landing" has all the entertainment value of being caught in an elevator. Each episode included acts like rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling, not unlike the actions of other drama shows of the time. As for the cast, I've seen better actors on a cereal box. From the mid to late 1990's, repeats of "knots" on U.K gold stung like a mountain of mildew diapers. Unfortunately, I have to say that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the show and would watch her religiously. Since then, there have been few repetitions (hopefully it will stay that way). The only positive thing that can be said of "Knots" is the catchy saxophone signature, later used as theme music for the I.T.V sitcom "The Upper Hand". Great legacy, what?
