I hated this movie. It was absolutely terrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL-theatrical, REAL REAL stupid criminals who were not even the LEAST-BIT joke (unlike the first two home movies, which were very good). All the fool-bogs are faint, pathetic excuses for poorly copied ideas of the first two, which only means that the people who write this movie were just lazy because their paychecks were not over $ 20 a week. This movie is absolutely lousy, it's not even worth renting. In fact, do not even look at TV! Use your eyes more useful by seeing the first two! I only give this star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say if you liked the first two and you are not a completely stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not look at this movie !!!
