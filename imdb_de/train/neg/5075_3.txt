The animation was good, the imagery was good, if not totally original, but the story was too long, too confusing and overly dramatic. After about an hour, I could not wait to cope with it. With so many characters having nothing to contribute and designing elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere, this movie really was not a movie and would have been better than a short series or possibly two films. If you like this kind of typical story, you might like it, but frankly, I've been spoiled with much more creative stories that actually have some kind of message to tell. Borrow a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice. You will get much more of it.
