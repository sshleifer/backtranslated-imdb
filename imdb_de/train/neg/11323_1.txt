This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It's unbelievable that everyone thinks this movie has earned the time and investment. I've seen "B" movies, but the "C" movie was just invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped looking, but after fifteen minutes I searched the videos in Knights. High school productions are better than these and the actors involved should delete them from their CV. Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to my mind. My roommate, who loves this kind of movies, even turned it off. That really must tell you something. If you see this movie and you like it, I will pray for you.
