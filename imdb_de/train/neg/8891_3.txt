The most famous of all Shakespeare plays was seriously disappointed here. Sloppy direction, stagnant studio work and unpredictable performances destroy a beautiful tragedy. In the city of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been hostile for centuries, but a tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. The bloodshed soon breaks out ... <br /> <br /> The studio work, especially in daytime shots, seriously stagnates the energy of the game. It's a story that, with its energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. In connection with this, the costumes are disgusting, with too many tights and ridiculous pieces. The stage fight looks terrible, with too much stretching and running to get involved. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a really effective Romeo. He controls the intensity of the character as the action gets going, but his handsome accent and his expressionless, often expressionless eyes limit his range. It is very difficult for the audience to get in touch with this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Julia - she captures the naivety of the character, but a little more sassiness would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles do not look much better. Joseph O'Connor's brother Laurence is fine, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio is on the stage and not in front of the camera. He's crouching and gesturing excessively, making him look rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman does not play his role as well as Tybalt. He has developed an advantage and intensity to deliver some excellent screen performance in later years, but that's not happening here. The prince can play a good role with his short appearances, but the actor Lawrence Naismith does not give the part any authority over the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, probably in his best role in this series, gets away with every dignity. His capulet is well played and it is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story instead.
