What is that crap? My little cousin obviously picked this out for the overly girlie DVD art and title ... I decided to check it out with her so she would not get bored, and I was certainly appalled by the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> At first the spectacle was terrible. They look like amateur actresses watching the playing cards. The delivery is below average and very formulaic. Scene cuts were awful. It looks like they took it straight from the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Second, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or very well played formulaic. I can not count when I could predict the next joke. I got a few giggles from the apparently "subtle" sexual allusions. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. come on! Just stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a PG kids movie with unnecessary sexual allusions, vulgarity and violence to improve the MPAA rating. STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to drive my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call now?" <br /> <br /> "You could drive my thing." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I have blood on my stool!"
