This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator to be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus is also called Demonicus after about an hour. This gives the script the necessary depth and challenges our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The ghost of Tyrannus does his little to-do list (kill some people and say repetitive sentences in Latin) by owning the body of a college man. To do this, he uses a magical mind-control helmet, which the college boy readily turns on his head and then takes off and sets in several places in the movie. Maria performs oral sex by Sean Willian Scott of a poor man, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball Glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason and apparently sits for centuries in an old concrete tunnel alongside CG fire. Much unhappiness. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Do you see it
