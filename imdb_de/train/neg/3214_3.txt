First and foremost, I want to tell you that I like comics, anime, animation and stuff like that. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. It's okay to start the story. Follow the history of comic books, as far as I know them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and stick to the original cartoon style drawings. If we pretend that we do not see the rare, sloppy effects of fire and lightning, you could say that the movie was shot about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - four years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, the vocal talents do nothing special, the music is nothing special. All in all - there is a lack of atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say that I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. Maybe it's shocking for someone who has never seen more mature animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice. The chicks around Lucifer were delicious and we have Lady Death ourselves! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, he would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all, the movie is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - vampire hunter D: Bloodlust
