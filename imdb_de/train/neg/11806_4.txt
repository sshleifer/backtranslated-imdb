It was hard to watch this movie and to be absolutely fair and objective as I was a big fan of the original 1944 film. For me and many others, this is one of the biggest movie noirs ever made. Realizing this is just a shortened TV movie, and most people threw it away. I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare it to the 44er movie. Scene by scene, I compared what I saw and recalled Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Now I saw these famous actors playing their famous roles, which were replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. When it was all over, I realized that it was not as bad as I expected, but the 1944 original is not up to it. The two main areas in which this TV movie was not so good were (1) the power between the two terminals was missing and (2) only 90 minutes were characters and chemistry between these tracks. Crenna and Eggar were shallow and simply unworkable for MacMurray and Stanwyck as Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> Where this remarke was in the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also interesting to see how the timeframe changed, so that the houses, cars, phones, dictation machines, etc. were all in the early 70s instead of the mid 40's. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just rushed. <br /> <br /> However, one visit was enough and I will gladly return to the original version to see the rest of my visit to this classic story and the movie.
