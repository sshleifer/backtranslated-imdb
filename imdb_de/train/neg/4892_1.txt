They have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> okay. At first I doubted it, but after seeing the breakaway cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they had sex with watermelons, with dead or living humans. Of course no safe sex. The (frighteningly ugly) captain shoots everything into the woman's mouth after he has done the dead woman. never heard of HIV? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring, but also incredibly disgusting. In fact, it was sometimes so disgusting that I could not avert my virginal eyes. Sex with the dead! how large is it? and what is the message behind it? We need water, we need melons, we have to be dead to have sex? Sorry, but that stinks!
