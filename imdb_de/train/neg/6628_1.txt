If the scale turned out negative, I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director have ruined everything in this story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting, and everything else distracted from trying to remember the story. Oh, if the songs and dances did not make you rip off your ears first. The film could have been shot twice at 1:25 and could have been pretty good, sort of like "Seven Samurai," but the director and the author did not go in that direction, even though the "bourgeois" finally wanted to find their backbone and help. This film fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography, style, lighting, script - name every aspect of this movie - it was bad - probably the food from the caterer was also bad. I've never seen Indian (Bollywood) movies in 6 years that were done so badly.
