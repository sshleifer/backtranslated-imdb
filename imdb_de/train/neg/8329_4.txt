I doubt its importance for Queer Cinema because it is more a homosexual encounter through violent behavior than to make clear statements about homosexuality and violence. Three stories are interwoven in a sloppy fashion. For the first 15 minutes I tried to unravel the chaotic story that did not suit me well on my own. Weak things repeated endlessly, as if we had not received the first ten times. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of padded dialogue throughout the movie. Rather like a 45-minute boy's letter as a full-length movie. It had a certain erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal, but overall, the sum did not match their parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: boxer / stalker action was the strongest and yet she felt so thin too Bob has pursued Tim for four years and confront him only now? I felt that the Katzemaus game was not developed enough to make its conclusion. We needed more information about her and less scenes with the parking lot / locker, Tim said relentlessly, "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his buddy Tony to beat him while he's shaking. Tony does not seem to mind, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the implications of his homoerotic hobby - not even after they've gotten naked. This story lacks the all-important transition from "I'm a pure boy chewing my boyfriend for fun" to "I think I could be gay and beat him because I want to spread his butt and make him a S / M style . " A very important thing to skip. <br /> <br /> Of course, these stories could have given their points in half the time. The third part, in which man and woman beat each other, contributes to this idea. In addition, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes, the actors did a good job under the circumstances, and the four male leads were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts), however, was on a par with a talent show at a high school. The film made no statement, wasted time and is not engaged or worthy enough for a thoughtful investment. Her fatal mistake is the amateurish approach that ultimately makes it impossible to take seriously.
