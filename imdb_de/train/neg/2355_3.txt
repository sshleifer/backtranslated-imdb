I was almost always against recording songs in a movie. I was convinced that the quality of the movie would automatically improve if only the extremely annoying songs were disturbed. However, things have changed quickly after seeing this terrible Black (no songs) and this movie (many songs). While Black was extremely weak at the extreme, it delivers a gripping story with strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost random and fit almost seamlessly into the movie. There were certainly no women spattered with water from unexplainable sources of water for no apparent reason, as they circled wildly on the streets at night. There was nothing to gloss over and almost every scene was absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend these films for Hindi-speaking people who at least have a little understanding of life in Mumbai. The former, because the English subtitles were below average and contained many errors, which at times completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter, because you will appreciate the accuracy of the presentation in any case, if you once lived it yourself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely appreciate this as a work that deserves international recognition. The scenes with the gossiping drivers were a nice touch and served as a source of real humor as well as a different perspective on the entire mish-mash. However, the film is inadequate in some places where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that affect the overall direction of the film very well done. It was an amusing sight to watch rather than bring any feelings of sadness, and the whole scene seemed more ingrained a little stupid. However, these are minor problems, as the film is by and large really a rare sight. <br /> <br /> All in all a cynical, pessimistic and refreshing view! Actors, not "heroes" - that's the key. A chance to see credible people in an extraordinary environment - in everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the scale of depravity and a rare glimmer of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
