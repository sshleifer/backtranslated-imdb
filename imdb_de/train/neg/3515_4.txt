Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there were a few things that hit me. First, the use of oral epithelium was used. In two cases, the Scott character mourns one, once at the beginning, when he drops his bomb from the target during the bombing ("damn") and once when he tries to make a Bombardier a pilot (" s *% t "). I could be wrong in the second instance, but I repeated it several times and that's how it looks to me. The third case is the case in which the O'Brien character's Anne-Shirley character wishes goodbye and good luck ("Give Hell") over the roar of the engines. She must have thought that this is too unfussy because she clearly says "crap". I also found interesting the character who has moral problems with bombing, especially on civilians. The Avuncular Supreme Officer assures him that only military targets are hit due to the precision of the bomb attack used. Considering what we know about LeMay's later strategy of setting fire to Japanese cities, this scene is not without irony. I remember McNamara's quote from LeMay in "The Mist of War." To some extent, if the US did not win the conflict, he would be tried as a war criminal. The end is completely overworked, matching the movie. It kind of reminded me of the end of White Heat (I do not compare the movies, just the end!). Maybe it's just because he's being blown up. Really well blown !!!
