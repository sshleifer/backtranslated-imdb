I saw that at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! All the clich√©d, violent, rich boy fantasies were on display, you only knew how it would end, especially with all the shots of the boss's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the questions and answers with the director / writer and author / producer they tried to find as intellectuals, but you could say they are guys who are affected by violence , I bet they often visit brothels and take drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to stop my friend from coming out.
