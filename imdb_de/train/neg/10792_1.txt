This movie offers only the stupidest conversations that are possible. I probably could not imagine how meaningless a movie is, how synthetic the dialogues could be until an hour ago, but then I saw this video. In a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, you expect at least good acting and tasty conversations and maybe even some humor. Nevertheless, this movie is missing all. They have heard that they are missing at all. There is not a single point I like about this movie, no. I hate it. I am sure that everyone will do that too. The name should give the target group some thoughts about nudity and things, but also fails at the nudity. I do not know how, but I have been able to stand this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you not to do it. The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. If somebody offers you to watch it, ruaun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
