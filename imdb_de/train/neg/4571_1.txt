What the Bleep know that we know is a deluded and random look at the secrets of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named), who strip and pontify in a completely unscientific way. Her interviews are chopped up into annoyingly small segments and distributed in conspicuous cgi and trivial miniplots. <br /> <br /> The film teaches science, philosophy, theology and politics without regard to accuracy and then extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. We believe that quantum physics betrays the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult-to-answer question the filmmaker would like to refer to. <br /> <br /> It is faulty and logically non-successor. How did we start with quantum mechanics and lead to this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my thoughts. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is nothing original and almost nothing specific. Every discriminating viewer is disturbed by cumbersome edits, intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance. Educated viewers are prey to the violence that has fallen victim to science and all the other issues that come in contact with this film.
