This is a confused and incoherent jumble of endless scenes of boring dialogue and monologues. This is no exaggeration: you have to make an enormous effort to even try to get involved. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira are suicides in the end But instead, someone in each scene tries to explain, "When he was young, it happened. .. "and" he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there ... "etc. Erwin / Elvira is soon in the movie in a slaughterhouse talking to a friendly prostitute (surely a slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant chat) and tells her the story of Elvira's life Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after another. It's hard to decide if you pay attention to the disturbing pictures or what the transvestite says. Of course we come to the very coercive and crude symbolism of "I have suffered much in my life and am dying". <br /> <br /> In one of the sparse moments when actually something happens, Erwin / Elvira A former lover meets that only after an extremely gay choreography with two other men (as if he sought the necessary level of homosexuality) he acknowledges Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting attitudes and ideas, I have to admit (for example, when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything in the movie is wasted by Fassbinder's self-interest.
