I was waiting for this movie to be played with great anticipation. Assuming it is more detailed than the movie "The Christmas Box," based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to friends and family asking them to see this show in the hope that they would understand a little bit of my "new" life better. After watching this movie, I was so disappointed. As a mother who had lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knew the pain, I had hoped that this film would illuminate the parents who "think" they understand the grief that a parent who lost a child understands Has. This movie was a very carefree movie and the stupidity of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face for parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to finish. After the movie, I had a few calls that were all the same: "It was so inappropriate and made it appear that you're back on the road in a short time listening to songs on the radio and life is back." Bunch of bulls! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child, because no one would have ever made the film so. I think that's Hollywood.
