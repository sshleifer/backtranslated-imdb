The John Goodman program was pretty awful, but it just stinks. The only thing that made me smile in this mess was to see the voice of Patrick Starfish as frosty. The story is hopeless. It was written by someone who has lost memories of the childhood rebellion, but has never made sense of adults in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world in which these characters live. Everyone is uncomfortable and without reason. The plot is predictable, but the show moves in such a meaningless way from one inexplicable, disconnected scene to another that it's no fun to see it. The worst thing is that nobody on the production crew ever saw snow!
