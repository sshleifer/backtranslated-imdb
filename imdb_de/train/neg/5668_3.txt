First of all - in this movie, there is absolutely no flirting - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Her first endurance test is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. That would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion just like the next reviewer, but without a context in which I want to put it, it's dismissive. So you can do it through the torture and the chaos. Then we meet with Donna and the film becomes something else - not better - just to another: a street scene without a heart. There are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos - widely written and played by Broads like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and also some hookers and drag queens). They all deserve better. The photograph is intentionally confusing. So, if you have travel sickness (or really ANY type of illness), this movie is not for you. Come to think about it, I'm not sure who this movie is for - except maybe gay and bi-sexual S & M fans who like poorly scripted, badly shot Indy movies about themselves.
