"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of Dracula. If a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal his blood for auction, they can barely refuse. The students are relentlessly persecuted by a Vatican vampire killer! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a somewhat entertaining horror movie that has many shortcomings. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting pretty average There are some good gore effects like a really cool double beheading scene, but there is not enough violence for my liking. The movie quickly gets boring and forgetful and there is absolutely no tension. So if you like modern vampire cords, give it to me more atmospheric vampire coolers from the 60s and early 70s like "Lips of Blood," "The Brides of Dracula," or "Lemora: A Childhood Tale of the Supernatural," to only a few in four call.
