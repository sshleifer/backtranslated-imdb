A comparison between this film and "The Last Detail" is made by some individuals, but "Chasers" is flatter than a portion of the Interstate Highway in West Texas. And, as with the scenery in the desert, there is not much to distinguish, not even the fact that this time a female prisoner is being carried by two Marine escorts. No one in the cast is too good; That's not surprising with this lame script. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give him much room if he ever writes a memoir, I do not think so.
