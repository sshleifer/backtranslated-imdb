As I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how he marginalizes black men. The movie spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man is in it (except for a heroic moment). By the way, for the majority of the movie, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) are barely visible in the movie. Vanessa Williams's character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some well-visible and three-dimensional supportive figures that are fair-skinned, and some white characters with a certain warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Voeless shadows in the background, without consequences. Such a terrible mistake, but anything but unusual in the mainstream media.
