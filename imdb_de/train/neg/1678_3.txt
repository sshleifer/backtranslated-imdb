I want to make a pun Holmes with Doors, but I can not string everything together. Accordingly dingy and overworked WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time .... but how shy is this movie about the famous 14 inch! Australian crime thrillers are filming all the time, leaving graphic violence to one side. As once a famous US Cinema double standard said: "Kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and its action PG 13" .. WONDERLAND is also 14 minutes too long, and at the end of the bad spiral we were all Glad to escape the cinema. How many movies with the title WONDERLAND do we receive? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and muted color indicate the dodgy tone, but the wobble-cam becomes boring, as if we're staring at her nostrils all the time. A few keywords from THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER make you forget the next day.
