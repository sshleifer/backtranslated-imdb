The Bloodsucker leads the dance - what a ridiculous title, he is so misleading. It's not surprising that the filmmakers are trying to mislead us because it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. > Very little happens in this film. And if something wakes the viewer out of its numbness, it is always an unintended comedy in the form of a cruel dialogue held by a hopeless group of vocal artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors for whom they deliver voices sound like a group of idiots on the remedy scale. It's really hard to determine how bad acting is by synchronizing this abysmal scene. However, the speakers can not be held responsible for the script. It's a travesty. In the best case unintentionally funny, in the worst case miserable. The story is inconsistent, to say the least. The female characters are especially idiotic; The men are either scary or boring. <br /> <br /> The whole company smells of pure exploitation of the public. It does not remotely deliver what it promises, and even when the murders begin (finally), they all appear off-screen. We only get a few half-hearted headshots. <br /> <br /> A few people say that this movie is a giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who likes Italian thrillers should avoid this film, because there is nothing exciting about it. It's basically a softcore porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. I can not recommend that to anyone.
