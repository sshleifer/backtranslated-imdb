It is a bit sad to see someone who is good at doing something, doing something different ... and is mediocre in the end. I thought about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is reasonably well played and staged, but the script is a stinker. Martin has done a great job transforming a classic story in Roxanne into a comedy, but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene nestles directly into a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story that has been updated with style, it's best to rent Great Expectations.
