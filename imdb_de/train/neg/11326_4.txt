This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy movies made by Albert Pyun in 1993 - and he is the bad one. Apparently all his energy was invested in "Nemesis," an entertaining action movie that looked much more expensive. "Knights" is chunky and cheesy, a sci-fi from the ground that too often resembles a video game (new enemies keep popping up and have to be destroyed as fast as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the garbage bin is Kathy Long; Not a particularly attractive woman, but indisputably a brutally efficient fighting machine. Kris Kristofferson, considering his age (58), I hope his stunt double was well paid. (* 1/2)
