One of those thank-you-don't-live-documentations. This tells of two fighting factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of Medellin. Weapons, drugs and death are common. The boys, who are not older than 22 and are not in the middle of the war, are in jail. The girls ?? not women, girls? Always react the same when one of them is killed with tears and screams. You scratch your head; What did you expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: the nightly shootings and riots, or that everyone seems to accept everything passively. Or to see this boy drinking, who is obviously not his first beer, and anything, 10? If you took these young men out of their situation and brought them to a place where they had more opportunity to be more, how many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, I'm afraid.
