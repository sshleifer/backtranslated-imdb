I was looking forward to "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, however, was a 1 1/2 hour nap. The premise seemed to be pleasing: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a company called "Mr. Fix It," in which discharged men claim his help for their girlfriends to retrieve them. Film is the editing, the script, and the acting , Although I found Boreanaz irritating in his other film roles (with the exception of the Crow movie he did), it was disappointing. At times his character was interesting and others flat. The side cast reminded me of the players of the soap opera. I know it was not a big budget movie, but some editing and music just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
