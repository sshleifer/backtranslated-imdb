Inaudible-believable! Meg Ryan does not even look as usual, which usually leads me to forgive her superficially chic acting. Hard to believe that she was the producer of this dog. And Kevin Kline: On what kind of suicide trip did he make his career? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Eventually, this was led by the man who made Big Chill. Must be a repeat of the Jonestown Hollywood style. Wooofff!
