Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee-pee-pee, as I prefer to call him (because of his penchant for showing male genitals), is perhaps the most overrated Marxist director in Europe - and they are on the ground. How any "art" can see in this messy, cheap sex-romp mix is ​​incomprehensible to me. Some of the "stories" could come directly from a softcore porno movie, and I'm not referring to nudity so much, but to the simple and banal, often meaningless stories. Anyone who has enjoyed this relatively observable but stupid curiosity should sing their teeth in the German 70s series "Der Schulmädchenreport" because that is what "Decameron" looks like to me. <br /> <br /> The film is sloppy on almost all levels, from start to finish: <br /> <br /> 1st Editing. For example, at 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds, there is a chase scene that is clearly in the wrong place. It was supposed to be placed about a minute later, but I think Pasolini must have hired annoyed editors who have little time for the "fine details" of filmmaking. Pee-pee-pee fans would probably disagree by saying that they were intentionally placed there - which I very much doubt. Apart from that, that would be even worse, even if that were true, since this story brings absolutely nothing if it's harder to follow. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's films in broken form ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. They are sloppy. The fans of Triple Pee (all 8) proudly explain how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are actors not humans or are they Martians? Sure, many actors have subordinate IQs, but should we treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors have used amateurs and were successful (like Alan Parker or De Niro), why are PPP amateurs in his films so terrible? The answer is again a terrible sloppiness. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as possible. He is a lazy director, an IMperfectionist, if you like. The anti-Kubrick, I suppose ... The main goal of Pee-pee-pee at the casting must have been to find as many toothless old people (and young men as he likes). In Pasolini's world there is a simple formula: edentulousness + strange face = realism. It's all well and good to have her toothless, but at least try to make at least halfway decent performances from these inexperienced neo-thespians, otherwise you're an amateur yourself - in the case of Pasolinini an amateur director. Whether 3P-0 was not capable of this performance or just did not care about it does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even notice the terrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. The synchronization If 3P-0 had the feeling that microphones are too cumbersome when filming a film, then he would have had to make an effort, at least in the post-production, ie to make all Bum actors to communicate their lines in the studio. so that the audience does not have to watch as the mouths move, while the elusive dialogue hovers elsewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of concept. We have almost a dozen stories that are not meaningfully connected. Some are anti-ecclesiastical (more on that later), while others are just sex yarns, d. H. Cheap male (sometimes gay) fantasies designed to tickle and nothing else. The stories and characters are (if anything) not amusing on an intelligent level, but on the lowest level. 10-year-old children can laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with that, but do not call it sublime, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a consequence of point 4, the logic is also missing in the order of the stories. This is of course. Pee-Pee-Pee could have arranged the order differently, and we had exactly the same movie. This also means that you can start freely from the middle and then go back to the beginning. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti: When you start eating, you can start with any thread you want at all no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The futility of resolving the stories. Most stories end with a cheap gag / joke, d. H. A damn silly punchline straight out of a porno comic, while some stories do not even have a conclusion: they just end up. Finito. At best, the stories are observable half anecdotes that have little deeper meaning there - unless you find "deep" meanings in porn. There is nothing easier, of course, than to search for "meaning" and find where it is missing. Thus, every hardcore porno movie can be philosophized endlessly. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh your 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> Concerning the Church ... Some viewers are enthusiastic about his attack on Catholicism and what not. In principle, all of this is fine and beautiful - after all, I am an atheist myself - but these people ignore the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the pot that calls the kettle black. A Marxist who criticizes the church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get his nerves from? Besides, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his high-minded and self-righteous attitude is unjustified. Finally, Marxists are believers: they have merely replaced the accepted God with the idea of ​​a utopia that is just another supernatural wishful thinking. Therefore, I can not get upset about the anti-religious antics of PPP. <br /> <br /> This Sophomorphic Humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini, who says rather presumptuously, "I wonder ... why produce a work of art, if only to dream it?" He did not call this silly little movie art, or ...? In the event that he was - the poor deceiver - I have to wonder why he did not let it dream and NOT do all those bad movies ... <br /> <br /> I want to read my changed subtitles Bergman movies?
