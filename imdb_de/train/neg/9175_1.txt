This is the worst movie I have ever seen. This film matches the quality of such films as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even these had namesake actors who missed out on this film. The "eye candy" of this film looked like a 50-year-old woman with a bad facelift. (just an example of quality). I would have rated this film negative if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that the men were not bad, but not much either. If you plan to watch this movie, I strongly recommend saving your money.
