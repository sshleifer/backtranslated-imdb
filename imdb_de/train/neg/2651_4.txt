The first 30 minutes of the strip were choppy and hard to know what was going on (unless you read the book - which I did not have). <br /> <br /> If you can stay in the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but still cute. <br /> <br /> The way it was filmed, you might think, it was produced in the early 80's, not 2005. <br /> <br /> No flashy moments, boring, but it moved to get bored without me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role. Your part would have been better with a player at the level of the other actors to keep your balance.
