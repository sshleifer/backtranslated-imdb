I did not see the first two - just this one called Primal Species in England. I do not think I'll take the trouble to look at her. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Terrible spectacle, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about it is so bad. The most likable characters die very fast and leave with the annoying, especially with the name Polchak, who is an incredible jerk. Nobody would survive in the army for 5 minutes. It took forever, but I was happy when he finally had his head chewed - I had nightmares he would survive. The colonel was also garbage - all moody sulks and unsuspecting shouts. And the greasy doctor looked and behaved as if she had no porn. I waited for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn herself into a vamp, but she did not. Too bad he would have revived the movie without end. <br /> <br /> Did not Roger Corman make even half decent movies?
