"Shadrach" was not my favorite movie. I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below average. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not credible at all. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially if they had a housekeeper in the house. Their social classes were too far apart to believe it was believable. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the film, there was a scene in which Andie MacDowell got out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? What should the scene show us? Why was the scene contained at all? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was never mentioned again. It seemed unfounded and did not fit into the story at all. There were too many discrepancies in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was nice, but I was not convinced that the Dabneys were as friendly and generous as they were portrayed.
