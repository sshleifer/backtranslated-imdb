So ... it's really sexist and classic, and I thought it might not be at the beginning of the movie, as if Stella Steven said she really would like to change and start talking the right way, and he does not tell her to change. Well, he has certainly changed his tune, and it seems the other reviewers have followed suit. What at first seems like a love story is about social mediation and about women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film does not make her a heroine, it makes the whole thing sad. and it's sad that people think that makes them heroines. Maybe that's the comment of the movie people should take with them. The positive reception reflects the ongoing patriarchal currents in the social conscience. yuck
