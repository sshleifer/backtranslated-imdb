It is unbelievable that among all the countless crimes that were uncovered and clearly laid down at the gates of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, still admirers of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and still make propaganda in their favor. It only shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A psychotic killer is glorified in this movie. It is needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. The fact that both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit through this seemingly endless propaganda film shows the view of the tunnel they have in relation to their cult object.
