Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in the plot, too short, appeared too low. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are unfamiliar with the novel. In some scenes, it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I am sure that make-up has made it best to hide it. I think they did not want to stop filming until it was cured, too bad. Probably this movie was missing in kissing scenes. Just a disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and should be true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more faithful to the book.
