Bad plot (albeit good for a B-movie), good, fast paced fight scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this movie: How come that Mariska Hargitay never talks? In the TV version she shares with Jeff Speakman some intimate moments, even a kiss in a garden. However, in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks. This bothers me because it not only removes a female (albeit clich√©d) view of the film, but also makes the final setting scary. This movie would have been better if they had kept their scenes, because in these scenes she has at least one personality that undercuts everything Speakman says.
