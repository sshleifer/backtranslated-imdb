This movie succeeds as one of the most unique movies you have seen. But that comes from the fact that you can not make heads out of this mess. It almost seems like a series of challenges that determine if you're ready to leave the movie and give up the money you've just paid. If you do not want to feel disappointed, set off through this terrible movie and develop a real compassion for the actors involved. They've all had better days, but then you'll find that they've actually gotten quite a bit of money. If you do, you'll feel sorry for them, just as you've already done for the film. I can not talk enough about this horrible movie, it would be almost something Ed Wood would have done, and in that case it would surely have been his masterpiece. At the beginning, you're forced to sit through a movie opening dialogues like you've never seen / heard before, this must take five minutes. In addition, it is said that the viewer can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the tide of terrible lines starts, it's like he's just working to get lines to the movie poster marker line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff (whom I usually enjoy) and he does his best not to drown, but in the end he does. Then comes the ultimate insult: Tara Reid plays a smart role, oh, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she always gets roles in movies, but in my opinion she should stick to movies of the American pie type. <br /> <br /> All in all, you might want to see it for yourself when it appears on video. I know that I got a kick. I mean, let everyone be honest, sometimes it's comforting to indulge in the flaws of others.
