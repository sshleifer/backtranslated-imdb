I saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I went, I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty good price ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, I did not want to get out. but I was embarrassed to do so because the producer of the film was in the show. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all, the dialogues are flat and lead nowhere, the characters are flatter than the dialogues, nothing leads anywhere and the worst and the worst: many Siemens and Organics ads for the film. Despite the fact that I've already paid to go to the movie and talk, I still have to be bombarded by the main person chatting on the Internet, and Siemens Mobile is banging on her laptop all the time. or another character taking a bath or cutting his hair just to let Organics Shampoo appear on the screen! All of this would be tolerable if the plot, the characters, romances, everything was good, but bad, really bad! A "I do not know how to make sex in the city". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
