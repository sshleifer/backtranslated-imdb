Normally every movie with Sylvester Stallone will suck his ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception. The only films in which Sylvester Stallone was good were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is unbelievably unrealistic and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I did not like it, and I would never look at it again. No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for the worst picture. I would give this 3/10, the only reason it got the 3 was because it had some good action, but not good enough.
