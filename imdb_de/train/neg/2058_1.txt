I can only say very little about this film. I'm sure the paper's idea and script looked good, but the filmography and acting that I'm scared of are not the standards I'd expect from some very talented people. I would doubt that this is very important in her resume filmography. Michael Caine was occasionally wooden in his role as a doctor, and at no time did I really believe in his character. The conspiracy was incredible, especially with regard to the victim's son. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films. Sometimes I wondered if it really was a parody thriller. The lighting was sometimes dark, and this added to the feeling of watching a movie with low prices and some big stars. I wondered why I even bothered to look at him.
