Despite much style, flash and glitter, this French musical can not speak. The melodies are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is as uninteresting as the many characters. <br /> <br /> People break into song and dance without motivation or reason. Most of the performers wear fake-looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets seem hopeless on the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end of me. Surely a shame, if you have such a multi-talent in such a weak last effort. <br /> <br /> Going to show, I think, where follow-ups (in this case to the great classic "Umbrellas") often go awry. You can not recapture, just recreate.
