In a way, this is the catastrophe Fellini has been working for all his life. The line between absurd masterwork and free association bullshit is very small, and in which category a movie will ultimately fit, often depends only on the personal feelings. That is, "Casanova" has me in cold admiration for his sets and little more, which can not be summarized by Bukowski more appropriate: "Casanova has also died, just an old man with a big cock and a long tongue and no courage .. To say that he has lived well is true, saying I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true, the ladies are usually looking for the biggest fool they can find, so mankind stands where it is today : We've bred the smart and enduring Casanovas, all hollowed out like the Easter bunnies we give to our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I could understand, this is the position Fellini has on his subject occupies. With more empathy granted, but still disgusted. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment consists of decay and incestuous behavior, issues that Fellini explored in more detail in "Satyricon". The sequence of conspiracy is characteristic of soft porn, but without the context. and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy until distraction. <br /> <br /> However, it could only be a point to portray Casanova as an unsavory fool. And I urge everyone to formulate this point without being obvious. Fellini could not. He seems here more than ever like a dirty old man - a maestro, but one whose impulses more than any other satisfy. I can hardly imagine an audience that likes this movie. It was a story that is not worth telling.
