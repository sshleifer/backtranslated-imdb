I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it hit the market in 1970 for the first time. Back then, I was a healthy 20-year-old who loved movies and liked Raquel Welsh very much. In addition, I had read the Gore Vidal novel on which he was based, and found it very funny. I saw the film at a driveway and about halfway I was very tempted to turn on the engine of my car, so maybe I died of poisoning with Monoxide and did not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was rude and sloppy. All the actors were flat and the director did not have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting decisions in film history. As a critic here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or the book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten by the young stallion, which would never be enough for the legendary Mrs. West. Oh no, the plot has changed, so she sexually beats him up, believably from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
