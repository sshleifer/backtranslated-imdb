Michael Caine has always said that Ashanti is "the only movie he made exclusively for the money" and "the worst movie he's ever played in." Wait, Michael, were not you in The Swarm and Hasty Sundown? And were not these two films much worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine is too recollective of the physical criminality required to film an action film at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (director Richard Fleischer was hospitalized during the shoot following a sun stroke). What Ashanti turns out to be is not the career low point of Michael Caine. Instead, it's a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring tracks, and a very formulaic storyline. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a doctor of W. H. O., who is devastated when his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) disappears during a relief trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realizes that his wife was abducted by slavers - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and sets off for a continent that eventually leads to the Middle East. On the way, big stars for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a helicopter pilot. Omar Sharif shows little of his usual charm or grace as a spoiled Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison is rightly bored during his brief role as a helpful person in his quest to assist Caine. The film is based on a bestseller called Ebano by the lesser-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the tension that has made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is as charismatic as the slave (he does not seem to be able to perform badly in all of his films), and Caine creates believable torments as the man who believes he will never see his wife again. There are occasional action flashes, but in general Ashanti is pretty slow. All in all, it's a resilient piece of action hokum - not as horrible as Caine has often suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a disappointment to all the talents involved.
