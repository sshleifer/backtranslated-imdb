I did not see the first movie and if there is something similar I do not have much desire for it. <br /> <br /> After looking at it a few hours ago, I have to remember something. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, it seems to be a group of very angry people who live in a house with this dodgy old woman from Friday the 13th and are stolen from wooden planks <br /> Some people are dying, the movie is ending, I'm bringing a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie because I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this movie off my hands ...... oh, I've already given it to a "friend".
