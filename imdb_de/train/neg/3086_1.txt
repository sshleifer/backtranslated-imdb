I once thought that "The Stoned Age" is the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed anything I could imagine, and I could not do a few. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and all the others involved in the genesis of this cruelty. I will not add teasers to this movie, I'm not so cruel. I can not subject innocent people like you to such torment. In fact, any discussion of the plot that relates to this film is pointless and humiliating. Words I would use to describe this movie are as follows: bland, asinine, and relentless. I ask you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, PLEASE. For your own reason and intellect, DO NOT OBSERVE IT. Destroy all copies you encounter.
