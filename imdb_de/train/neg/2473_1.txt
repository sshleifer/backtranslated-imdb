If my grandmother made films, they would probably make a much better figure than this ... unbelievably bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are fine. Especially the mother, she is a nice actress, and the child also proves to be a nice, especially in the scenes where he is supposed to be scary. But the director knows the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. The script does not develop an atmosphere to become an exciting thing. If you like being hunted by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise you just stay home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: the movies of 2001, but we could not realize it, because the picture is so bad (as with mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70s and 80s).
