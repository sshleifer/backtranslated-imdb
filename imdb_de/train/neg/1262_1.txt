This film has a faint plot, a weak characterization, and really weak special effects that make me wonder why I lost precious lives by standing. It has random characters that add nothing to the story and appear as an excuse for the director to get his girlfriend into the movie. The robots are sad and the "hero" bot is activated by a huge knife switch. If this movie was not so bad, it would be ridiculous, but there is nothing funny about it. The main enemy is one of the few redeeming characters and he is killed. It is sad when you choose evil, because it is the best you can cheer for. All in all, this movie was better funded on the tailoring floor or not at all.
