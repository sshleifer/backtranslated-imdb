This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made, even for Fellini. The only thing even more bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two-and-a-half hour tour of a strange, nightmarish world full of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a strangely unsightly Casanova, and the strange occurrences in a series of vignettes, taken from the autobiography of the great lover, can not inspire the viewer. The art direction and costume design, however, are EXCELLENT. The Academy has failed to even nominate the former, but has lived up to it by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. (Odd) nominated was the disjoint, meaningless and almost inaccessible screenplay. Imagine that !! The movie is only 150 minutes long, 16 minutes shorter than the original runtime. This spectator was grateful.
