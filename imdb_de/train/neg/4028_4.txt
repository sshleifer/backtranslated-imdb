This had all the prerequisites for a very good movie - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious rocket from outer space threatening to burn the planet), and plenty of stock footage (if the Air Force had film.) Jets that fired missiles (it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film is a rocket from space attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit. At less than eight kilometers and a speed of more than 4,000 kilometers, it emits an outlet of one million degrees and burns everything on the ground, including glaciers, early warning systems (DEW) and Eskimos base stations. <br /> <br /> Any attempt to destroy the missile will fail. <br /> <br /> The first mistakes in this movie come up early. While we do not expect much from low budget movies, some things can not be forgotten - like a bit of research. For example, both the Soviets and the US are firing off the missiles impacting the missile with unerring precision. The first successful ABM tests were, however, carried out only in March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cries and boo hoo at Loggia's victims like a screen test. Loggia is as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) gets it so high that William Shatner looks like a thespian. A bus driver is constantly spitting scene after scene from the garbage of the world. The only good actor is the movie narrator, played by Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"), an experienced character actor. <br /> <br /> All this could be overlooked if it does not take the schedule. After the missile information has been sent to DC, the Pentagon is catching up with a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. Afterwards there are discussions of scientists and there is a deadly pause when ambassadors ask if the rocket is an attack of the Russians and if a reaction is needed. Military is completely confused. Civil defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people are on their way to shelters as school buses pick up millions of children (and we see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, though the 1950s sci-fi movies seemed to be this is the standard). The press stays in the dark for ten minutes. Then a man in the Pentagon announces that the rocket Ottawa, Canada, will hit in 51 minutes! All the above actions took place in 12 minutes! To fuel the fire, Loggia somehow thinks about a way to stop the alien missile. He slowly produces a dropload of plutonium, loads it into a jeep, and takes it from DC to a distant rocket base to lay it on a rocket. On the way, he is beaten off the road by a wild driver, collapses and is then chased away by car. He finally retrieves the plutonium and drives to the base to activate the rocket. Again in 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film also upsets the viewer by possibly saving Ottawa just to fry men, women and children. The rocket will then have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia still drives to the base (4 miles further). He comes to the base and equips the rocket, a countdown of two minutes is announced. Everything within five minutes. The neighborhoods of New York should at least have been scorched. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile will be destroyed if you did not think so. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium nuclear strike. Five seconds later, the pressure dissolves and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear bomb of 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements it needed to be a good B-movie, but wasted it. Loggia played his character so lame that you did not care that he sacrificed himself in the end. They did not care about the other characters, not even the scientist Pine played. The tension that should have shifted the film was not possible in the time frame (this would not be the case even today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been reissued on any medium and for good reason. I do not know if the film was intended or whether it was customary, but there is a scene in which the government sends the best scientists, military and business people into deep shelters that say they are too valuable to lose , There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the movie and he gets a short while playing the piano. It was worse than "27 days", where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet, and it does not contain blacks or Hispanics. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a special sci fi night on Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to reappear. If you find a copy of it somewhere, you may want to publish it on Amazon.com.
