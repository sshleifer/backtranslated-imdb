Oh my dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of the talk show, but the movies are a whole different ball game and he's way out of league. The script for this film is so bad that it has to be seen to be believed, and it's sad to hear such vaguely known actors as Michael Dudikoff (80's action? B'movie King) and Michael Jai White (Last in Sci Seen -fi-flop)? Spawn ') as well as Surviving the Games' William MacNamara (who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole movie!) Make this issue difficult to manage. If you're a fan of Jerry, stay tuned to his TV show because it's a waste of an hour and a half. After that, I managed to watch the last half hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece. I think that says more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
