And how many actors can he use for his own neurotic obsessive over-New Yorker personality? In this film, Woody is played by Will Ferrell in a compassionately less direct identity than in "Celebrity" by Kenneth Branagh. It is now an annoyingly repetitive story: Nebbishy, ​​a neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend, falls madly in love with a Shiksa queen to whom he projects every kind of perfection. Everyone lives in perfect, gigantic apartments in the major neighborhoods of Manhattan. All are in permanent, exclusive restaurants where all the characters tell fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy. There is always a trip to the Hamptons, where the main character of the Nebbishy roams over sand and sand, physical exertion and possible exposure to disease, and then, of course, the main character feels guilty about his desire for the Shiksa Queen, but pursues it anyway, sometimes he succeeds, sometimes he fails, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula and proof that Allen is not a great movie artist at all. He looks like a dirty old man with the libido and the emotions of a 20-year-old man who always wants to tell the same boring old stories.
