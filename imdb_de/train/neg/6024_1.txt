I watched about 30 minutes in this movie before I was tired of being hit over the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot", and every single actor. It's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and yell, "NOTICE ME!" again and again. The villain keeps his bad guy music going and says scary evil things just in case you did not get it right. The good one does brave and noble things just in case you do not know that he is the good one. And oh Lord, the plane scene. "My husband misses! Oh my god, it's impossible for him to stretch his legs or go to the bathroom or anything, he has to miss something!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and panicked before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in). <br /> As a religious girl I would like to apologize to the world for wasting the film on which this film was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
