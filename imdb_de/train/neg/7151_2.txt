I am proud to say that I have seen all three fast and furious films. Sure, the actions are kinda silly and they may be a bit cheesy, but I love them chases and all the beautiful cars and the secret midnight races. And I would like to see a fourth. <br /> <br /> Want to know what the difference between these three and Redline is? Decent acting, well-thought-out plot, even when it comes to pot-boilers, and last but not least, directors. All three were made by very competent directors, all of whom shot the films in a different direction, equally exciting. Redline looks like the producer has picked a dozen women to sleep on the casting couch with, and from this the extras, picked up his leads from Hollywood's jobless line. And the script. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad. This is a '70s bad thing for the TV movie, but you do not see so many in action, and the plot is so bad you can not get caught up in the chases. If the cars do not excite you, why should you? to go to a movie like this? I am in the audience with a group of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing out loud. I get dirty looks, but this was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> Rent the F & F movies.Go to Nascar Race.Go to a kart track and drive yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
