The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect and nothing more. Of course it's not an Oscar-nominated movie, it's just pure entertainment in which you can lose yourself for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially a group of National Guard trainees struggling against the notorious mutant hillbillies on their final day of training in the desert. It's just that they defend themselves throughout the movie, which involves a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), with blood and guts flying around all the time, and another graphic rape scene that's thrown into meaningless shocks , <br /> <br /> I would give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for entertainment only. Even though I kept looking at my watch even as the movie progressed, it started to slow down as it repeatedly tried to shock the audience with graphic flashes and occasional jump scenes, just to keep the audience awake, The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass the time when you get bored, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
