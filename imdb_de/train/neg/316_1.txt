This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to make a movie that plays the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights, do not do the damn movie. I have to say that I was able to see Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could see the trailer for this POS of a movie. Adam Sandler should not be excluded from any film after this shame. Watching this movie is like listening to a mix of Cher and willing to stick your cock in a blender. Anyone with half a brain cell will find that this movie is worth a penny. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would provide it to the Lorraina Bobbitt Foundation before purchasing this film.
