I agree with other users' comments that the two main roles were well played, the man who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Too bad that the story was so boring. Since I had heard nothing of the story, I did not know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it was something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how was I wrong? The whole movie talked, talked and talked about her parents. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks, where the father would lose his temper. That was the only interest I got from this Borefest.
