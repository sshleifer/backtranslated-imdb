This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed films I have seen in a long time. I've never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd try: Bad mistake. The film will show how the real murders of Son of Sam in the summer of 1977 influenced a quarter. The focus was actually on the most boring characters, which I doubt anyone was worried about their drug problems, marital problems, etc. a shoot and then back to Saturday Night Fever! Even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the film: Spike, trust me, you're not a Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, it makes you worse. The most ridiculous scene had to be the dog talking in a stupid voice that was portrayed in a scene in front of where it should have been filmed. Spike, what did you think when you made this movie? I do not think that I think at all. People who believe they see a crime drama follow my advice and do not waste time or money on this loser. It's better to look at Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of film, I gave him a 1 in 10: terrible guy.
