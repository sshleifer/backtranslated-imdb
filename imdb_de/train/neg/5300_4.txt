I'm one of millions of Columbo addicts around the world and I just watched this episode on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think about what's coming out of this so-so movie and I can only marvel at whoever discovered the enormous potential of "Columbo" and added all the little details that make it a wonderful & classic series. However, this movie is not as good as the rest (other than the embarrassing conclusion and the patronizing British episode). If Columbo had been made after the original "pilot," it certainly would not have taken long, or seen and loved all over the world. In this movie, Lt Columbo is dressed smartly, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and looks quite aggressive. There's nothing like the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and "the villain." Watchable, but only for the novelty of the launch of Columbo.
