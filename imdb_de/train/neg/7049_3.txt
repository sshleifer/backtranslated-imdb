The only worse thing than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. For spectators who like to surf this movie, this will be a huge disappointment as the total number of minutes that the material is used for surfing reaches only three perfect wave, but for each wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer making a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just when he wants to grow up with his wife, whom he loves, three old surf friends turn up and persuade him to look for Bone Yard on the beach. The problem is, there are no waves until the end of the movie, so most of the story dissolves into a meandering sequence of disconnected beach events. Sean Pertwee has a few funny moments, but his acting was mostly banal. Ewan McGregor was decent as a drug representing a wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the group. Probably the funniest performance was shown by Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his corpulent body into a permanent show. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as always, but her character did not really have enough flesh to show much acting skills. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to comment here. I rated it 3/10. It is a real beach grief.
