Such great actors as a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and terrible character, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen "IT IS A DAMN CRAP !!!" soon. It's just disgusting and annoying. In addition to the foolish conspiracy, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can lead to epilepsy. Normally, I'm not interested in the decoration in the movie, but that of "Free Money" infuriated me. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing! You can see it at the expense of reason.
