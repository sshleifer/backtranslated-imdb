Steven, what have you done, you have reached a new low. It's strange since Steven's latest movie, Shadowman, was directed by the same director who did that junk. Shadowman was good, that was devilishly so bad that it was not even funny. Steven is barely in the movie and feels like he's in a cameo, and when he's in the movie, he's half in sync anyway. As for the action, let's just say the Wizard of Oz had more action than this garbage. There's hardly any action in the movie, and when it finally arrives, it's boring, depressing, poorly shot action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone other than his over-films, in which he leads a man army, ie under Siege 1 and 2 and injury wounds. The plot is so confusing with so many storylines that sometimes it does not make scenes. Flight of anger better to be good, what a shame, I lost 5 pounds for this garbage 0 out of 10 more luck next time
