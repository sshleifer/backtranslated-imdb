The problem with family dramas is that most people outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime do not want to watch the movies. And those who are being watched are prone to sensitization and current or current issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Especially among the young, this would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger ones making films that are not just popular but financially successful for studios. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I had with this movie are the caricature of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all of Lohan's acting (ruining the car, drug use, etc.) for her stepfather's behavior. Although not unlikely, it's only a bit to expect the audience to swallow. Besides, other aspects such as giving the young morman boy oral sex, or that she would actually give the veterinarian a good assistant who happens to have something for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not have the kick-start to really help this movie With. It was more in the element of a situational comedy that tried one of their "special dramatic episodes" than a fully realized, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> If you watch and listen to the DVD The commentary, especially for the various alternative endings, you can really see, all this is sharp focus.
