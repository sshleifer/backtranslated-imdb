I could not decide if this movie is so bad that it is good, or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad that it is past good and gets bad again." Anyway, it made me look like a bunch of strangely colored vomit, and it offers a series of scenes that you will not forget, even if you like. There is a sneering boy Ray Liotta who tells a pia pia that her creative trophy looks like a penis. A little later, there is again Ray, who bothered Pia, not with the appropriately shaped trophy, but with a garden hose. There is a tightened Pia who tells her dominant mother that she wants to go to bed with Ray's Geezer father, Walter. There is the actress in the cemetery scene who smiles the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYYY!" There is this garden hose again, as Walter swings to him, Pia's face and roars: "Is that more to your taste?" There is Pia and her date, which are so big that they take close-ups of other kicks, that they pull off each other's clothes. There is Pia showering but forgetting to take her dress off. Perhaps the best is Pia's typewriter, but instead of the keys, there are the talking miniature heads of those who tortured them the most (later I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, there's Pia at "The Awards", where Hollywood is exhibited for the cloaca and the second best line of all time is spit out. "I think I'm not the only one who ever made it to the top." I see, I have spent more time commenting "The Lonely Lady" than I have on much better pictures, so I will stop. However, be forewarned that as soon as you begin to watch, you will probably not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have disappeared forever.
