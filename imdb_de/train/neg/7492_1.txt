Apparently, most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe and the Hitler and Stalin era. Nuremberg (and many forgotten processes throughout Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why were not American, British, French or Soviet defendants after the Second World War? There were no American, British, etc. war crimes? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not really a consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must go down! (This was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible, unedited American brainwave instrument, full of mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And above all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why was the Nuremberg Trial not enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the true cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would be jealous of it ...
