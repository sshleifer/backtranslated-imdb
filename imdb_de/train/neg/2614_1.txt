A sequel to Disney's 1996 remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being detained by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!) Was "cured" of her obsession with fur. But the "healing" is broken when Cruella hears of Big Ben's donation, and she sets out again on the crazy quest to make the perfect mantle from Dalmation skins. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad Many levels, starting with the fact that this is a "Thanksgiving Family Schlock" movie that aims to suck every last available amount out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over acts as Cruella. With all that she had to endure in this movie - the lame script, the endless make-up that was finally baked in a cake - I hope they gave her an extremely large paycheck. <br /> <br /> (Speaking of where in the world there is a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelit restaurant, all in the same building - as you'll see in this movie) Of course, the real stars of the movie are the dogs. They serve as "Macaulay Culkins" in this movie and pull out all the stupid "Home Alone" gag on the bad guys. (They bite into the crotch, run their luggage carts over their hands, squirt them with icing, etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit the dogs were pretty good actors - much better than the humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is totally wasted in this movie as a freakish French furrier. The two human "dog lovers" - upgraded from the earlier film with different actors - are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner in an Italian restaurant, the film is pushed back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene of Lady and the Tramp. I thought, "Oh please, do not go there!" I half expected that people would make a satire on the diner scene "Lady and the Tramp" - just as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - the "spaghetti skein kiss" while the meatball with the Nose pressed, etc. <br /> <br /> And do not let me go to the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> The costumes were nominated for an Oscar and the costumes in the movie * are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable.
