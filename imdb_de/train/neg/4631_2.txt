Although Misty Ayers (a burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as a blonde lead role, this movie is just an excuse to get into underwear a couple of times (no nudity in 1954 when this movie was made, not 1965). > <br /> The guy who hires her for work in a Laufhaus resembles Abbott Abbott & Costello's Bud Abbott. Most of the other women are unattractive and the drunk woman enjoys herself in a spooky way. <br /> <br /> A 2 of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvy physique, but you can not judge acting skills because the entire movie is re-enacted , Some of these "commercials", which are usually made later than this one, are kind of interesting, but this is really a boring feast. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed. There are some samurai-like expressions and interesting apartments, but there is NOTHING here.
