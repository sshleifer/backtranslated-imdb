Tony Scott leads a thriller sports movie that should appeal to non-sports fans. And some say baseball is a great sport ... boring ... too slow. Well, wake up! Externally, he appears to be an angry salesman (Robert De Niro) while he's in a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan. Together comes a new thug (Wesley Snipes) and a proven redeemer from the contaminated sites. Our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard-hit All Star gets into the worst slump of his career and the Giants are afraid of collapsing with him. De Niro is the personified terror. Snipes seems very natural as a ballplayer. Other noteworthy roles in the cast include: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy it. Violence and very strong language are to be expected and you will get your money's worth.
