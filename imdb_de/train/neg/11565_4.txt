After the second week of "The lone of Beauty" I am a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the acting is good as long as we are just the drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can think this FICTIONAL DRAMA is "factual" coverage of the "Thatcher" years - it's fine as a drama, but I think the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow-up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow when "Things Can Only Get Better" ends in 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with this promise of a government that is full of senses.
