This game was made by Sega. Since I was made by Sega, I did not expect much. For starters, the camera angles in this game work against you. The motorcycle is your means of transportation. The bike is the worst part of the game. Whenever you run into something, just stay there and do not move. They never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character barely speaks, though he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are terrible. You cycle through trees. The camera makes it impossible to fight the enemy. This game is not even worth renting.
