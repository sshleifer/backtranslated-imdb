As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a penchant for the city, I was looking forward to this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing kids. I can not believe how regressive it is in women's view. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed watching my beloved city on the big screen, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is terrible. It is an embarrassment for the city after which she was named.
