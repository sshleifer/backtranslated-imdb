This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is painfully slow and I was bored almost every 98 minutes. The drama is mediocre at best, but the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, clumsy, and clumsy with no real direction. Occasionally an eerie mood is interrupted only by a useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and threw between two shots, they had to digest a terrible screenplay. As a big fan of good horror movies, I am always irritated that something bad is going to happen. Save 98 minutes and you will never come back.
