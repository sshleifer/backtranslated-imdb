I did not want to see that. I bought this on DVD and under the movie I was confused and put the movie out for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here's what I do not like: <br /> <br /> 1 You turned your father <br /> <br /> 2 The logs were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 the dinosaurs looked (mostly) fake <br /> <br /> 4 the bad scientist good he was annoying <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality on the DVD was really bad. <br /> <br /> What I like: <br /> <br /> 1 The music of Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it's fine for his time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs, they inspire a kind of reverence. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby is kind of cute when he's in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 This funny scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 The kids who watch this movie hopefully will learn that evil always loses.
