Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This film is from the beginning a piece of crap. It has a really stupid "plot", really pathetic "drama" and so "special effects". <br /> <br /> Thirty-year-old "post-teens" are trapped in the woods with a crazy reptilian creature of rubber suit hanging around endlessly. What you get with this movie is a lot of talk and precious little action. They have girls walking through the woods, and then you have boys (with heavy mascara) walking through the woods. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is rarely seen in most movies. When it is shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the blurring and distortion of the image , <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in any form since the word and those who have praised it are most likely the people picked up from the street to "act" in this truly amazing movie! Skip this with safety!
