A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters, and subordinate dialogues (to say the least) plague this TV production, which could have been of little interest even with a billion dollar production budget. The characters are not credible in their motives, actions, or professions. The plot reads like a bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hack, but with plasma gangs and force fields. There are serious continuity issues, and the degree of meaningless interaction between characters at least makes this writer wince. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. Watch all the episodes of Dark Angel and you'll be better at acting, dialogue and action. Yuck
