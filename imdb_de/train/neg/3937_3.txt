It is hard to believe that David Duchovny was at the forefront of his fame in 1997, with X-Files, one of the best science-fiction series of all time, at the top. Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his attempts to get it on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his fame put him in an eternal role from which to take great talent and she was really lucky that a movie like "Playing God" did not turn her career into one Dead end led. Fortunately, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" were waiting behind the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career began. <br /> <br /> There is not much to tell about film. It's Andy Wilson's only big movie, and there has to be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what happens on the screen is expected in this story from a former doctor who saves the lives of a shooting victim in a bar just to work for the mob. The off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moralistic text that kills every nuance of the movie's cinematographic experience. You probably will not hit the movie, but in DVD rental stores or on TV. Look for something better.
