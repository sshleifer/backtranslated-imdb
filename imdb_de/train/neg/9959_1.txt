Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has dark dialogues, unconvincing characters and an absurd or non-existent story. In a cynical effort, getting rid of a sense of emotion from an insincere and uncontrolled hysterion becomes worse and worse! <br /> <br /> And the HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap shots can a movie make? Incidentally, the hedgehog has shown the most convincing and observable performance in this ninety-minute Cringe-Athon. <br /> <br /> If you've considered watching this movie, then not. I'm sorry, but I can not find a single redemption feature for this movie. With me it achieves a big, fat ZERO. Only for sub-dogma-knicker weather. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
