This is a movie where you have to say two things: 1) I can do a lot better than this (acting, writing and directing). <br /> Looks like it was shot with my flip video. I also believe that my friend, who told me to take care, has a revenge on me. I have noticed that there are some positive contributions to this home video. Must be left by crewmembers or people who have something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I have ever seen. hopefully the authors and the director will leave the business. not even talented enough to advertise !!!!!
