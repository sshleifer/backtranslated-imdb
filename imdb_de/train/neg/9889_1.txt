In a woman under the influence, Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she goes crazy. If I lived the way she lived with the family, I would go crazy too. Everyone in their family is off the seesaw and not completely present. She's always surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what's best for her and people who are not the sharpest knives in the drawer, her husband, Nick, is a bit off his rocker. He always yells at her when he's home telling her how to live her life and stop behaving like an idiot. The rest of the time he works at his job for many hours and he is not there to support her when she needs help. The one person in her life who should always be there for her is never there, and if he does, it only makes her worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first if she thinks she is wrong and does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital, he just tells her how to behave rather than comfort her, he just yells at her and tells her what to do. The other big people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing for her. Mabel basically lives her life because she is afraid to get up and stand up for her. In the end, she even asks her father to stand up for her, and he does not understand, and when he gets it, he still does not do anything. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or prevent her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person who tries to do something for her is Nick's mother. Nick's mother is adamant that Mabel is committed. She does not want Nick to handle it, so the doctor committed it. It seems everyone is against Mabel and they think it's a good idea to get involved because they do not have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except to yell at them, and she feels like she's doing something wrong when she really does not. That's why she went crazy and that's why she had to commit it, it was all her family's fault.
