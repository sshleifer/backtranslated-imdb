I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are shareholders of the production company, as this was probably the worst movie I have seen in the last five years. From the first shot of a rabbi who laughs uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill to be considered a "B-level." Both my wife and I were in a good mood before we started this movie, and we were really looking forward to a fun popcorn movie. We knew we had not rented Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most amazing movie of all time. But after 40 minutes of surviving with the most painful trash I've ever seen, we switched it off instead of wasting another minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" is without laughter, terrible acting, thin storyline and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this image since I've spent almost an hour finding a joke.
