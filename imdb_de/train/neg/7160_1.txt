Well, if the cameo of Jason Miller (who looks even more eroded than in Exorcist IV) is the pinnacle of a picture, what do you have in it? <br /> <br /> It's a bit of land, a little bit of Rock n 'Roll: Mix two drunks with money to carry your child everywhere with a swamp-dried mummy (find out one has already come out - DRIED in a moor?) Dyeing and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if she had developed them. <br /> <br /> I understand - somehow - that they visit their relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are some interesting flashbacks where I have to assume that her mother was killed in a car bomb attack (I think). This is never connected with anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need the grandmother for? Now the grandmother could be interesting. She speaks Gaelic or Celtic or something. Maybe you can make something out of her. The best thing they can do is that they have tobacco habits. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: You are really unstable as a husband. Is he a type cast (will he sell his wife to the devil, maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her) or is he cast against guy (if he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He is not a bad guy. Not good. But averse. Why did not you do something with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old friend appears. The husband beats him down. He comes back to knock down the husband. (It gets pretty dumb, but at least that character has motivation.) NOW - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he might have just married her for her money. The grandmother is locked up in the bedroom. The blind uncle brings our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch (follow that?) That may come to life. In fact, you know that it is brought to life, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, brings tea to her grandmother (opens the door) and supplies the grandma with cigarettes. Grandma gets out regularly. But nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose the child in the house and then lose their bedroom. Uncle gets his throat cut in the basement. The leading actress has nosebleeds. The man drinks. They both drink. Given all this, the terrible truth pointed out in the first Over-Voice - Omigod - is an abortion when the lead actress was twelve years old. Despite all these dangling threads ingredients, no one managed to get a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no gradation from slight disturbances to terrible horror, only long, slow scenes that go nowhere. the grandmother, who may be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst mistake is smoking. She has great hair, good make-up. <br /> <br /> In short, no action. Only a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library, the rain pouring in, and the soundtrack leads us in. They need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie Production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice landscape, good wardrobe. At least the cameraman knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. I'm poor.
