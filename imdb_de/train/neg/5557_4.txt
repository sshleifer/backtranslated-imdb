OK, but does that make a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. There is not much to recommend. I found it very slow, boring, in fact. It's also pretty predictable Number one and two were reasonably predictable, but not so much. I also had the feeling that this film was sometimes quite muddled, which I really do not consider this series and the character. He is a decent actor, but I felt he played his character too much. I think that suited the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I liked the movie. In addition, there were some pretty bad liners. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but has little work to do in this film. The character did not really develop as I had hoped. Oh, that's just my opinion, not terrible, it's pretty bad. My vote for Darkman III: 3,5 / 5
