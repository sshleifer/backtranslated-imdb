What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a trailblazer ... now scratching the floor ... Is this the same man who directed The Last Picture Show? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (though far-fetched) premise and turns it into a chewing gum that loses its flavor as soon as you take the first bite for its "looks" and not because they are right for the role were. Too bad. I will rent "Paper Moon" again.
