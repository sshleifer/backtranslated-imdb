I shudder at the thought of what people have been thinking of environmentalists after seeing that overflowing, preaching cinematic garbage. Starlight is rich in Indian wannabees and spaceboats to stock a New Age store. Starlight makes everyone who looks after the planet look like a feathered, crystal fooling idiot. <br /> <br /> The story? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to lead a flute-playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert the looming environmental collapse of Earth. But first they have to defeat a nasty alien who does not look so much like a refugee from a Castro street bar. Fortunately, they have mystic granddad Willie Nelson along with buckets of cheap F / X and innumerable swelling music to help (whoever looks embarrassed by the procedures, though he should). <br /> <br Sure, the clumsy script will help cover up the banal storyline and the incredible speed of the movie, but that's just the tip of this melting iceberg. Anyone involved with this film should pick up his union cards until he completes a real environmental science course.
