This was my first and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was very curious to see how Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, was there and was a The Theo movie that I've heard a lot about. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep soldier across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main presentation of the story is revealed to the journalist of the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue that kills the action and patience of viewers, does not happen on screen for 15 or 20 minutes, except for that old lady telling a story. Everything that is presumably shown through actions was simply communicated to the camera by the old lady. Immediately afterwards, the TV crew went to the bar. They turn the corner and winter starts! Probably was filmed on different days and the patency leaked. Many storytelling issues went from an absurd to an irrational style that never followed a style and caused viewers to ask questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni got a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political incorrectness, just to make a film about "humanity" in another report. Much more to say, but no time to waste on a bad movie that was not a movie at all, but a maniac insane who was impressed by the movie and paid with state money.
