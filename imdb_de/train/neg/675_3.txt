Urban girl Meg Tilly receives a terrible phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns to her family's rural digs home just to puzzle the question: why are all Homespun residents behaving in a bizarre and disturbing way? The radiation thriller, which has little to do with ecology, makes little residents of the city go insane, including (laughing) two women staring at desires in a public place and Tim Matheson being orally watched by a girl on an office bench. The picture is too stupid for words and wastes Tilly's melancholy and calm intensity with the garbage as he forces himself into a corner from which he can not possibly come out. Some of Thomas Del Ruth's movies are good (especially a fire sequence in a garage), though he's disappointed with the ugly editing - and a pretty bathetic finale. The simplified script has neither a surprise nor a hint of originality up its sleeves. * 1/2 of ****
