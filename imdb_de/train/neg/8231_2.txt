CAN SPOILER INCLUDE ... BUT DOUBLY REALLY LOSE CAN !!. <br /> <br /> Five over the eyes can be summarized in one word .... Amateurhaft. In this movie, it's best to distinguish yourself from most of the "Blair Witch" movies ... it does not work ... it just looks and feels like someone has a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist has no real motivation (and looks like a force-fed lesbian compared to the five girls), and there's no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching , The entire movie plays in a van, which means that a decent setting is out of the question. The five girls really do their best at what they've been given, but on the whole they look pretty awful acting ... although it's hard to judge from the material if they can do anything at all ... they spend the whole movie screaming, squeaking and Wow .... so much that half of the time it's hard to understand what's been said, and the cameras are so bad that it's hard to tell who said it. This video is self-described as a violent torture movie, but in reality it's just five girls in a van screaming in fear ... that literally sums up the entire movie ... then after 5 hours we end up screaming all the time and all five girls are still alive ... with one finger without fingers. The only thumbs up (finger on it ... fingers ... LOL) is for the poor actresses who have been trying and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after making this horrible movie. Do not judge by the poster ... you will be very disappointed.
