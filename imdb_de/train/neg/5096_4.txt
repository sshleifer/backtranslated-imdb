Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail boy for the fight against the television broadcaster UBC (this is United Broadcasting Corporation); He does not get to work anywhere and offers studio managers ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Program Director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals but has no idea how to select a successful TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who serves twice as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who nerves Russell when he wants to watch television. It turns out that the monkey watches all popular shows and can easily select the hits. Russell discovers the chimpanzee's talent and uses it to advance his own career. Understandably, things are going to Russell HAIRY and the cast! <br /> <br /> The chimpanzee (handled by Frank Lamping) performs well; Raffles looks boring and / or distracted in some scenes when the chimpanzee should look interested; These could have been corrected by repetitions or edits. A mellow satirical advantage is present - imagine a monkey picking TV shows! AND, it's a monkey who gets a BEER while advertising (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a number of funny TV actors trying to spot and place themselves. You could make a drinking game in honor of Raffles beer lust by guessing actors and where you've already seen them. Here's a start - Hey, is not that "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler - Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
