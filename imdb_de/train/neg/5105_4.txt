I think there are some out there who like Nicole Eggert from her little girlhood on TV shows like T.J. recall. Hooker, Charles responsible and who is the boss? You perverts, you! You may still remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. Anyway, you will surely forget them in this alleged comedy about man-eating aliens. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make no sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the aliens? Why was the alien hot on pepper and cinnamon? Why did not the alien eat her? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats her boyfriend and takes on his identity, you can see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to see this garbage. Stay for the shower scene and the friend and continue with your business.
