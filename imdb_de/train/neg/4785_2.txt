So much is wrong with this vile little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to start. First, it's a remarkably scary, frightening, frightening movie, even for American standards. The dialogue is a cliché, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum and the little story that is there is neither coherent nor of interest to others. <br /> <br /> We meet the following clichés in the order: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who does nothing heroic at all) , Brave Little Kid (one mile wide with a killer row) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more muscles than heads). These guys are in a constant battle with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. Oh, and the movie is full of evil little metal balls surrounding threatening people. When they have a chance, they spontaneously perform brain surgery on those who do not have the mental sharpness to duck when they hit them. Booh! In fact, one of them is persecuted by a good spirit (but it could also be a fraudulent ghost) who wants to help the brave contagionist find her young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> There is no background or even an introduction to one of the characters. It starts with a sort of summary of the end of the previous film, but that does not explain much. If you have seen the first two films, alright. Otherwise, you do not know who these persons are, how they are related, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care about whether they live or die. Consequently, you do not. The only interesting point is the splatter effects. And there is not enough of it to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Of interest and pleasure are the three Raider punks, as stupid as they are evil and threatening our heroes. But you do not get much time on the screen. They are barred almost immediately. Then they are buried (why would anyone take the time?) Then they reappear as evil raider punk zombies. Just to be unpacked, literally within a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie seems to consist mainly in the friendly spirit of Caspar appearing and disappearing, driving around and searching for places and Balding Loser trying to score points Bad Black Bitch Booty, with pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. No cube there; Not even unnecessary sex could have saved this movie, so it's good that there's never one. <br /> <br /> The main person called "Tall Man" can not scare anyone over 3 years old. howling "Booooy!" Every five minutes is not enough. Why he does not simply crush our heroes like beetles with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper body strength is not explained. Instead, he delegates the job to his awkward, backward little henchmen who never manage to kill anyone before they are shot to hell. <br /> <br /> Film-goers who enjoy masterpieces like "Friday, 13th Part XXXXVIII: Jason Goes to College" may find some entertainment. The rest of us, who developed pubic hair, are bored with our skulls.
