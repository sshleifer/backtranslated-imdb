I grew up with the "Superman II" theatrical version ("S2T") and as a kid I loved it more than Part I, as it not only contained more Superman and three Superman villains, but also started with a bang? ? the best Clark-Kent-Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Children no longer had to wait impatiently for Superman to appear on screen, as in Part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how the powerful fell with S2T (see my review). I have always heard from the back. Story of how you dismissed the director of the original, Richard Donner, from the second part prematurely and unjustified. (It had to have been a rarity to film two separate films at once, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after I finally saw the Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD") I still can not recommend it. Way was the big Superman Change scene, the entire rescue in Paris, as well as the wonderful summary of Part I at the opening of S2T. In fact, they all just wrote the words, "Previous to Superman ??" in S2RD. The special effects were not great in either Part I or S2T, but were they mostly ridiculous? how Lois falls out of the Daily Planet window. I'll admit some new scenes worked and some who took them out were welcome, like every scene in the "Honeymoon Suite". All in all, if you grew up like me on S2T and loved it as a kid? Unlike Nitpicking as an adult, you should definitely see S2RD as it is almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alarm) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: Gone was the strange amnesia kiss of S2T with the same ending as "I" replaced. This is not just a lazy, unoriginal copout, it makes no sense why Clark would return to this dinner if these events had never really happened. And will he continue to "turn back time" for any confrontation?
