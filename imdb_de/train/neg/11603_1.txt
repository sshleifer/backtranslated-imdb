Before the internet, this movie could never have been made, but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind it. Unfortunately, that was all it was - the general opinion that the Web in the Wring hands can cause so much chaos today in real life. Since the late '90s, someone has found that you could create a virus that could disable a computer. Just doing something evil via remote control, so this is the cyber equivalent of robberies by force. What spam actually is is without violence - it makes you disconnect from your money, and it's a miracle everyone's noticed. Nowadays, they get smarter and use real names because it's not important to do something illegal , We see that the Internet is getting worse week by week - the social networking sites or chat room that lead to evil, and the child porn sites that are illegal. The idea of ​​a movie that invites people to click on a name is exactly the same old thing - there is actually a site called Horror Vision, which is a porn site - but this kills the people who enter their portals. The story, however, is so incoherent and boring and comes to no conclusion. The final film on the subject of destroying an Internet service provider has yet to be made, but obviously many must destroy, as they will not shut down when money is to be earned. To call this a horror movie is pretty misleading, as it does not get bored
