According to IMDb, as well as any other website that performs a review; This "thing" has no director. Well, that would certainly explain a lot! Just a group of people gathering to film perverted porn and throwing an ultra-thin story about devil worship and women's sacrifices in the walls of a secluded sanitarium. "Hardgore" is a prime example of totally denied 70s, as it is really made with a minimum of production values ​​and script inspiration. Horror movies about satanic cults were extremely popular at the beginning of the 70s and also pornography. So why not combine the two? Here's a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who went to a lunatic asylum, and the first night it's already gathering a web of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo action. Really a lot of dildo action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she slit her neck the same night. The horror aspects are really poorly worked out and range from ridiculously scary Satan masks to virulent, severed penis attacks. The photography and acting performances are almost unbearably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie showing sperm dildos and amputated male reproductive organs? Senior Lady Justina Lynn is a pretty good-looking girl with a gorgeous body, but most of her co-stars (male and female) are vile and overly hairy sleaze balls.
