In this movie, children are not really encouraged to be nicer and have better attitudes, as is the case with a family movie, and this would not be considered a family anyway, as it contains some things that children should not see. Not the best movie of the ABC family, if you ask me. If the movie had less sexual themes, it might be better. Hollywood does not do anything to make a movie better by adding sexual situations. There is really no reason for her. At least that's a TV movie. I do not want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do than watch this movie, please continue with them.
