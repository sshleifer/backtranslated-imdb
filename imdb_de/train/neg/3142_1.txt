Once upon a time there was a director named James. He brought us wonderful, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbuster stuff made, and he seemed to have a fantastic future when the onset of computer-generated special effects hit the movie industry. Terminator 2 showed what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ countless awards. ......... obscene amounts of money ............ crazy commercial ...... ...... maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here ! <br /> <br /> I've never (ever) been on the train and critical for criticism. In fact, I've often adopted the opposite attitude towards the majority just to have a fight in it To bring gear. However, Titanic was a movie that made only one positive thing - Kate Winslett was absolutely great! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more of my nephew tree's wood, pictures that were supposed to scare were actually weird (man fell off the ship and hit propellers), historically wrong (do not even kill me because there's too much), it had dark theme music (up there with the bodyguard) cheese) and the pointless love story was so boring, selfish and pathetic that it ignored the plight of everyone involved (I was glad when he died and was disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was simple It was clear from the beginning that this image was meant for MTV watching, chewing gum, chasing a boy with a car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the shabby member a boy band) who would grind their gender. Famished friends for a three a And half an hour's knickknacks hoping to be lucky later! The worst part was that it did not stop there. Millions of fools have seen culture vultures to see this expensive waste of celluloid, because "it costs so much to make it, it has to be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their films". <br /> <br /> The grand finale came when the Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a sincere moment of silence for the victims of the deadly night on which his three and a half hour long farce was based. It looked to me like praying for forgiveness after making a fortune by inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the deaths of many people. <br /> <br /> However, when people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of garbage, they deserve to be cheated. Good luck for Hollywood, if you want to make money this way, I would do it if I had such opportunities in life! <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of worst films are other stupid, historically false / human interests like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
