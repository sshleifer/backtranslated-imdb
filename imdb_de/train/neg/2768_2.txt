This movie was awful. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any characters at all and the plot was terribly played. It was definitely a sleeper. You'd expect the action scenes in a movie like this to be his strong points, but D-Wars even surprises you with horror in this department. <br /> <br /> Acting was also a step above the level of a low budget porn movie. And I mean that seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the end credits because it was just so bad !!! Whatever you do people, do not waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.
