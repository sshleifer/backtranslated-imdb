This must have been embarrassing for any member of the all-African cast. Any derogatory, derogatory stereotype of the black American community is prominently highlighted. I will not reinforce the insults by referring them here except to mention chickens, watermelons and cubes. A good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad ones) and the fantastic vocals and dancing talents of eight-year-old Sammy Davis bring the total number of IMDb to under 1.
