Last night I decided to watch the prequel, or should I say the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)", which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ... .and I mean completely S% & KS !!! I do not think De Palma has agreed to produce this Sh # t feast of a movie ... except for me A fact that I put on a hat ... Jay Hernandez, who plays the young Brigante .. I recalled how De Niro followed in the footsteps of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was awesome and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez, he has the courage to be a young Pacino ... too bad for him. I do not think he will play in the movie. By the way, after watching this movie, I sat watching the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
