The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie with paranoia, meaty characteristics and outstanding excellence. It's scary, cryptic and cool. And it stands perfectly for itself, without stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie of the Cube series is partly retreaded (most booby traps are unfortunately recycled), partly aberration. It is a bold step to explain what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first film - but since this explanation is boring, I would rather keep it a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube, but they never evolve beyond clues to a kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what a small social commentary is flat and unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The drama is a pure amateur lesson, the tempo is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds looking at a screen?), And the gore effects do not convince them while they are disgusting. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a "cube" fan-fic, a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.
