If you love pulp fiction and handheld cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the quirky story (though I think "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated movie since "The English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by European arrogance. Worst of all, however, is the handheld camera. It's so distracting and annoying that I was desperately waiting for the end of the movie. I do not know why new directors like this method of filming so much. If you are prone to travel sickness, stay away. The handheld camera has nausea after about 10 minutes.
