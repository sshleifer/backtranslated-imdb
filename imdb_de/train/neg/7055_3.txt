Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said, "I missed the ride of joy". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just awful. The services were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emraan deserves better. Everything CELINA JAITLEY did was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was fine. Emraan Hashmi was also OK. <br /> <br /> MAN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to get famous. That's why he uses RADHA and pretends he loves her just because her dad is music director and could help him become famous (because the dad obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MAN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely in love with her appearance and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> That night, ROMA can not open the door to her room and MAN decides to help her. When he sees that he is not so good, ROMA asks for help. While she is gone, MAN can open the door and decides to come in and sit down on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and they have a one-night stand. In this one bedside table, ROMA falls in love with him. This morning they discover the Underworld Don (MAHESH) who sees everything. The Don loves ROMA and can not stand what he has seen. He orders them to marry, and when they are afraid, MAN obeys the order and Merry's ROMA. Then their marriage news ends up in the paper. MAN later learns that he loves ROMA after making a music video together. He is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> the movie is awful. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is great too. The title song is great too. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
