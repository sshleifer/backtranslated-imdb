OMG This was the most painful experience of my life when I saw this. I could even finish what happened to Nick. Her best thing at Teen Nick is Drake and Josh, and that will soon be up in the air. The nursery rhymes are kind of annoying and the kids too. My little sister wanted to see the show because she likes everything that usually happens with Disney or Nick, but after she finished that show she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring". My little brother actually fell asleep, I envy him. In short, if you are 3 years old and have no brain activity, enjoy this show, otherwise change the channel now.
