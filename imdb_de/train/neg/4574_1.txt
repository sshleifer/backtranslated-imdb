I went into this movie and expected it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, the film contains a poorly written, malfunctioning plot (with CG animated cells and peptides). The real focus of the film, however, are the "experts" who reflect talking heads spitting out a new era between two plot segments. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's innocent enough. In the beginning is a bit of real quantum physics. For example, it says that electrons exist both as particles and as waves, and that an atom is mostly an empty space. However, the film makes a huge (and unscientific) leap that says that subatomic quantum effects also occur on a large scale. The talking heads go further. According to them, <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see his ships because their minds were unable to perceive anything so different. Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - With positive thoughts, you can walk on the water. -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And hey, that's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> The movie's reputation was torture. This movie felt like a movie you would be shown to make you join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized it was just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this could be considered a funny comedy (albeit one that is not funny). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: do not see this movie.
