I really do not understand how people made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they put into the movie. Even more puzzling are the ones who have seen this film, without feeling cheated 88 minutes long, as he had done valuable, such as cleaning under the bed or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, they could not have found two real Irish people safe, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the tense, emaciated porn stars that were sprayed in this film. Granted that works Gore - but strangely, it is not so disturbing as you might think to see bodies from the hot (formerly) narrow bodies of porn stars left and right smart. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their terrible inhuman actresses you just want them to die in pain. <br /> <br /> If you do not take care of the following: <br /> <br /> - actors (seriously, are all shit I've never seen any sucks..). <br /> <br /> - Plot (some crappy horror films are remotely controlled or at least surprising.) film does not make sense, unless you are so devastated as the authors obviously). <br /> <br /> - Topic (Nothing to learn from this movie, nothing to fear at night in bed, nothing to think about or capture or explain). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (crap, crap, crap, music as normal and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - Scenery (Could have been the saving grace of this movie, but no ... here do not like it, even the rocks are wrong). <br /> <br /> Well, yes. If you do not care and you're just a horny teenager with a bad taste for music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: Interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Realistically wasted again. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree with the Mutant Removal, solving the wrong accent problem.
