In fact, these young people were so disgusting that I could not wait until all of them were slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), as I thought she was the most annoying. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess from the first few minutes when a teenage girl who opened Christine shot the priest and the nuns with Leslie Gore music in the background. There was no other option than to go downstairs. <br /> <br /> Even the prosthetics looked spotty and the "blood" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian punch, though later it took a red dayglo look to accommodate the stupid Halloween make-up everyone wore I am sure all GOTH idiots will appreciate this bullsh-t as it will appeal to this bunch. I certainly did not like it. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror movie from herself. She still looks hot. I'm glad she takes care of herself because we do not see much of her today. <br /> <br /> However, it's one step from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002), in which it's a somewhat coherent conspiracy, so I'll give so much. That and the little Boston Terrier named Boozer get it straight to the point. I like what Boozer does with Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films must have been desperate to record this movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
