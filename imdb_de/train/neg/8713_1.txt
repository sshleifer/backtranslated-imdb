Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine with the army uniform that's ten sizes too big is so bad with a permanent attempt to scowl on his face the leader of a Special Ops squad is hilarious! The "terrorists" are as scary and realistic as the "birds of prey", that's so wrong and bad at everything you try here, you have to laugh. The part where the huge T-REX somehow sneaked aboard a ship has been blown down a bit and you can see that the metal post is where his head was, the perfect ending. If you come in bad movies, this is the gold treasure, the mona lisa of bb-bad !!!
