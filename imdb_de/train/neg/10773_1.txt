I just saw this terrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of those movies you're watching right now to see how much worse it can get. Honestly, I do not know how much deeper the bar can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are composed of one lame stereo type at a time, and the apparent attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing, to say the least. <br /> <br /> I have seen some valuable turkeys, but there is no reason to list some of them, as this is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way: I saw the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so bad, it was funny. That ... that ... is not even so good.
