Another Priyadarshan / Vohra movie shot another movie that was more likely to be seen for TP than the actual desire. The only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars in this movie were not there (Akshay Paresh and many others), but I do not have to say that I had low expectations for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was generally satisfied with the casting, except that Rajpal Yadav, who once again knows no boundaries, however, pulls out some laughter, but these were the standard slapstick non-original jokes in which Actually, this whole movie is like playing the Dhol, I mean, it does not take much talent to make loud noises, or even play the odd good beat on the Dhol, right? It is only those who can carry different beats in a beautiful sequential manner for a longer period of time, which are considered great. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo requires little talent, he has no variations, and it may be pleasing for a while that the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it's not an instrument that can entertain you for a long time or even make you dance like Dhol. <br /> <br This movie was like the Dhol and the Dumroo that was played, sometimes the Dhol was played, sometimes the Dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like every 24-year-old earlier than later, I got bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good (good) moments, but after a while I only heard the annoying Dumroo (entertaining at first, then bearable, then irritating)), the big ordinary parts really make this one Movie is especially suited for a few funny clips to "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not seen him on Filmy, he comes in the evening and is really funny.) <br /> <br /> This movie had its Moments, the actors did a good job except for Rajpal Yadav (who can do that, I saw him in Main Meri Patni?), Who does more than just entertain, I've said it many times and I'll say it again. I really think that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career, especially in multi-star comedies. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny, like the aborted attempts to impress the girl's father, the crazy attempts to woo and take the girl apart. <br /> <br /> But after this was over, there was an af. The painful attempt to make this movie a mystery even further meant that the next 45-60 minutes, once the girl came in, was increasing became more painful. The highlight was "SO BATH ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY". I mean, what they were If you think, if you have a tense ending, at least try to make it tasty. <br /> <br /> The movie is also extremely predictable. There is hardly a scene that you can not predict, and you will not break into spontaneous laughter. Here it looks more like it is coming and is almost starting to laugh before the gag. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline in all films, except for the unusual downward or upward bias, and then plummets rapidly down. They have become friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were over, one that the movie is trying to be more than just a run of the mill comedy, many of the jokes were very, very The last 10-15 were outdated and stank of repetitions. They were very unsteady and were wasting this completely on MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta the siren she should play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in terms of her unattractive appearance when you can not be hot and can not do it How much time you can survive. Technically, too, this film was weak, with the constant female look and modest lighting and camera work. The songs except the title track was not good either, as the songs were played in the second half, I could feel the collective gasps of the audience. <br /> <br /> In all the movies, this is just an ordinary movie because of the cast and that is very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoid being a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if it has to be seen, watch it for free on TV or a very cheap matinee or something is a must If you pay the full multiplex tariffs, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> -s many outdated jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES AND LAST 15 MINUTES especially bad technical songs, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s tries to be more than it was not the normal cast (I'm happier for that), Tanushree Datta. Some good scenes at the beginning, theme song, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> <br /> totally 4.5 / 10 (I try to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie has met my very low expectations so I give it the benefit of all doubt absolute names of this movie was not more than 4)
