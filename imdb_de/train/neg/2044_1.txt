This movie is bad. I do not mean just "bad" as in; "Oh, the script was bad" or; "The acting in this scene was bad" ..... I mean, bad, because in a person should be held criminally responsible, because she pushed this unkempt heap of steaming dirt on an unsuspecting audience. I will not even acknowledge it with an explanation of the (Plot ??), if I can call it that. I can only imagine another opportunity in about 40 years of film shows, which I consider necessary my spleen in a movie. I mean, after all, nobody makes a deliberately bad movie, right? Oh well. Apparently they do that ... and the culprit is author / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters actually leases it to their customers! To be advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. Put on the shelf and collect dust.
