Here's a movie with a good cast and good-looking shooting, but he just does not have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better were his THE PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action also seemed to be in slow motion during the scenes without slow motion. If anything, this movie should be sped up. This horse foam definitely looked terribly wrong and the obvious tire marks in those desert tracking moments - just lazy. Sloppiness. Too bad. The actors were okay, but I've certainly seen everyone do better. Ben Johnson, however, is always a pleasure. I saw this streak for the first time almost 30 years ago. was disappointed at that time and stayed 30 years later at the second sight.
