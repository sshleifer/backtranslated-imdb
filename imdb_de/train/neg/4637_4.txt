The Bangville police were reportedly the debut of Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. In this case, however, they do not dress in the dumb cop costumes or drive the fast-moving car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is here a farm girl who has asked her father for a calf. She later sees strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One answers and the hunt is on. Next, Mabel slams her door shut just as someone comes in. It turns out that her mother comes to the conclusion that robbers are in it! While Mabel blocks the door with furniture, mother and father try to pave the way! This was perhaps the funniest part of the short film with some explosions of the police car. These were short 7 minutes that passed so fast that they are over before they begin. The only real characteristic that has been developed is that of Mabel, who exudes charm only with her face and big eyes, and is so optimistically happy except when she is afraid. It's easy to see why she became a star. It was mostly because of her that I recommended seeing this at least once and why I gave them a 4.
