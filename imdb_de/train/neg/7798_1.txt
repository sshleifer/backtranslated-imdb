This review is based on the eponymous shock-o-rama video released in 2002 on an undeserved world. How bad is it? It's awful, which is a "1" on the IMDb scale - but it's a lot worse. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print could make things better - the English-language comedy is not funny at all - but in fact, this is one of the worst amateur movies of all genres you'll likely see. The zombies in the movie are as slow and awkward as ever, and they do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to do chainsaws, and they are vicious enough to know that western taboos on genitalia will undoubtedly enliven their conversation at the table. George Romero's Land of the Dead used a zombie nation that retained a touch of social coherence; Zombies are nothing more than a blank canvas for the perverse performance of director Andreas Schnaas. Zombie '90 is absolutely a bad joke for anyone who wastes money on it.
