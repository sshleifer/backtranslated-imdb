I think the bad Laurel and Hardy are better than no Laurel and Hardy, but barely. It's sad that the Fox movies are released on DVD and people who are less familiar with L & H are exposed to their worst powers than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, the guys are saddled with a stupid romantic conspiracy over a guy who invented an invisible beam. He's in love with the boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers a slim guy. It's unbelievable to believe that the geniuses at Fox had thought what L & H needed in their films. <br /> <br /> Without their pancake make-up, the guys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this image are when they sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene in which Robert Mitchum, a classic noir villain, tries to sell Oliver Hardy's "insurance" on Stan br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
