Really. Is it going on for a week that Oprah does not remind us that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> She puts herself at the center of every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not resist dealing with the comment Answer every question she poses. She often interrupts guests before an answer is completed to bring in her own page or anecdote. The directors are obviously instructed to focus on their close-up response, rather than the faces of the guests, because that's what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - I'm sorry, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my struggle with my weight. Feel hurt if I get rejected by a fancy store after they have already closed. Feel good when you buy my magazines and books. Feel good for my success. Feel good when you give in to my charity so I can look good. Feel good to make me rich beyond belief. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of your point of view: YOU VISITORS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY COUNCIL. I have all the answers for your life, although I have nothing in common with you. I have never been married or would like to be married. I never had to start a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me - witness of "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> As of July 31, 2006, the headline on their website actually reads, "Oprah.com is your leading source of information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, mind, and health." How presumptuous and is that offensive? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she dropped off two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect material for her shows in September 2006. She promises again and again to leave the television, but her Yapfest continues without end. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor a personal mission of God. She's just a happy, overweight, black woman who copied the style of Phil Donahue and described him as her own. She was in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck in the right people. <br /> <br /> Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and I am surprised that people can not see through their fa√ßade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too, Oprah, if you let the pompous ego pass through the door - this way to the grand exit ...
