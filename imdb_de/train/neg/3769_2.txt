There have been many films with Bigfoot, most of which are not good, but most have at least one stupid charm. Sasquatch Hunters does not even have the goal. It's just a boring boredom. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists and rangers venturing into a remote part of a Pacific Northwest forest. Bones that belong to a species of unusually large primates have been discovered in this region, and since monkeys in North America are not self-evident, this leads to a scientific expedition. Sure enough, they soon discover an entire tomb full of remnants of these huge monkey-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb old burial sites in the movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters assembling their gear, wandering through the forest to rest, wandering through the forest, long enough to make a few discoveries to investigate and discuss the path, to wander even more through the forest, to search for a missing member of the group, to wander even more through the forest, to dig through the dirt, to randomize and gather around a campfire to discuss how little it matters have done this day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it turns into people who stumble around in the dark while they are taken off one by one (blinking and you miss it and the actual murder happens outside the camera). All this is painfully boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build tension, but there's none to be found, so we live on it with boring, lengthy scenes of people wandering in the woods just to get somewhere and walk in the forest at night, trying to be fearful. I would be lying if I said I did not use the fast-forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, like any other character in the film, he has little to do with it and lacks a certain personality. It looks like a shaggy version of King Kong, which is not too bad, except in the scenes where CGI was used instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious in the monster scenes in daylight. Part of me can not help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a bit sacrilegious. If there's a single movie monster I believe could only be brought to life by a situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that does not have an action so much as a premise. That's all it really is, a premise that the actors stretched out to a feature-length movie without adding all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.
