Wow, this movie is not just a "new lesson with a really bad taste", but also a lesson in "really bad movies". Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence', but at the same time you have to realize when a movie is awful. If you've missed the plot, the act of 'Zombie' 90 'is a government plane that carries toxic chemicals that accidentally plunge into the wild, causing the chemicals to overflow and the natives to become vile zombies. The next thing you know, zombies are living people all over the city, while a dumb looking doctor and a government official are trying to figure out the disease that makes them eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence." From now on, we'll only see zombies with field days in sight anywhere - nothing but extreme and pitiful disguises and dismemberments, accompanied by endless pots and guts. Since this is a German movie, the movie had to be dubbed into English, and if you do not laugh at the raging fury of the zombies, the voice overs are pretty funny and entertaining. As user UnratedX mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that crosses the border between acceptable and unacceptable range, hence the scene in which a woman carrying her baby is rolled in her Wheelchair some guys and a bunch of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. A zombie grabs the baby, tears it to pieces and eats its organs while you hear the baby cry. Wow, this is a new lesson about the bad taste of REALLLLLLLLY. Cruel I tell you, cruel.
