Hm. While an entertaining movie to plot holes, vile plays and (at best) primitive special effects (which have all led me to see this movie three times in the last six years), Severed is one of the worst I have I have seen seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are. All I know is that the killer uses a wearable guillotine, as seen in the dance-scene murder scene. All in all, I do not really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are fun. The rest is a mish-mash of confusing dialogues and images that do not bring the story to a logical conclusion (which I can not remember anyway).
