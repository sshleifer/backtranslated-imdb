This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I wish I could go back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "Movie" "War Games - The Dead Code" was shot 2) Watch the Original WAR GAMES with my current film on computer science AND the eyes of a Preteen from 1983. 3) Break into the Pentagon computer in the '80s, learning and remembering the knowledge and perspective. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER to change the position of THE DEAD CODE minutes before the first day of shooting NUKE Event, especially my original contemplation of "The Dead Code" 6) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of a good 80s movie. <br /> <br /> 8) Did I forget that? killed Jar Jar. I am not sure if I would have to travel for the future. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
