I really have no idea why some people only find the TV series Power Rangers interesting from afar. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people who play in them look completely stupid at the same time. At the Power Rangers is absolutely everything that is interesting from afar. This is just an expensive TV commercial designed to sell extremely unsuspecting plastic waste to unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes I can see that it is banned in New Zealand and what I have seen, I can agree to their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
