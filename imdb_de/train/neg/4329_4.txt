I'll never forget the joke and great comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The lines, tempo and timing of the events in this movie are outstanding! However, this successor to European Vacation is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel the Griswalds win a European Vacation at a Gameshow. The problem is that many of the jokes in the movie are no longer mild, "ha-ha," laughs. For example, a flight attendant in an airplane asks Clark: "Do you want your coke in the can?" Clark replies, "No, I'll have it here." This is really the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor of European Vacation is tense. As if the writers had borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to revise a previously created script, and leaned toward the end of the picture on a ridiculous scene of persecution, just to kill the time Worse, the natural comic book Stars like Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie and the original children, who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well, are nowhere to be found. Their substitutions are not funny, they can not act and just look like they're going through the motions most of the time. There are also some rough sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, but also have bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald's should have stayed in Wally World. The place that made her legend! Do not embark on this terrible European adventure. Viewers should instead see the original Vacation movie again! You will not regret it.
