As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes, I was very much looking forward to "The Woman and the Duke" (L'Anglaise et le duc), how he would treat men and women during a real war French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with each scene designed as an antique painting, like a tableaux vivant. And I expected a lot of talking, as is Rohmer's style. But perhaps Rohmer was reluctant to base the script on the writings of a real woman, so it usually felt like a docudrama version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. <br /> <br /> As dreadful as the excesses of Robespierre et al, some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept humming to myself: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor are poor;" You could also choose a tune from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I was not so nice as the main character has to go back and forth between her townhouse and her country estate to be ahead of the revolution. At one point, her maid claims the pantry is nude, but she sure manages to make a nice meal. I simply did not understand her, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution shift their political focus ever further; I think I should sympathize more with her consistency than with her political machinations, like a character from The Scarlet Pimpernel. Hey, the only reason she did not go home was her shame after an affair and a kid with the Prince of Wales or somebody. <br /> <br /> There are usually some changes in the relationship between men and women in a revolutionary time, but I have not seen any here. I once attended a Herbert Marcuse lecture that ended with a detailed Q & A. The last question from a member of the public much older than the rest of us acolytes, gray-haired, was, "Why are revolutionaries so grim?" She was cheered and Marcuse did not seriously respond - but it's the only thing I remember all evening. Rohmer demonstrates that counterrevolutionaries are also grim and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 11.11.2002)
