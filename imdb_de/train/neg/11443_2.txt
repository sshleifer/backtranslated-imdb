Here's one that you can see with a straight face, with a script that's so bad that even Will Ferrell would not be there. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1 The punch-dance rod "has to go to his quiet place," and before anyone can tell Kevin Bacon, he loses a passionate, over-excited bodysuit to the rigors of a band that wishes they had the fat hair from Europe. > <br /> 2. John Farnhams You are the voice. In one of those epic sequences in which the star and his cohorts The Slomo Walk walk down Main Street and follow the city's residents on their heels for support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the filmmakers come across this Australian recording artist? A major Australian singer (and a real talent) who became famous in the early 70's with Raindrop's Keep Fallin 'On My Head and then disappeared for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice until 1986. John Farnham's hymn is so adorable cheesy, leveled the mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Apart from these two highlights of the movie - both of which were ruined by the slipshod notation anyway - the rest of the movie is like suffocating another's vomit. Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper, who has never made a jump. Maybe it has something to do with driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yes, someone thought that was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a jump under his star belt, he plans an extravaganza of fifteen buses - which would surely kill a worse comedian like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider. to win the day and save his stepfather while eliminating cancer and whatever ... who is actually watching these movies? Along the way (as usual for idiotic allusions in these comedies), he scores a healthy chick (Isla Fisher), which must certainly be cautious to consider switching chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost telephoned her appearance - then she changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
