I saw this movie at the premiere in London, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I was expecting something that was at least mildly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not a great movie and is still something of a "dirt classic," but it was entertaining. I can remember countless times watching the channels on television on a late Friday or Saturday night, when I found the movie and started to really get into it. <br /> <br /> This lame brain, waaay-delayed continuation has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? Well, let's put it this way - it's pretty hot for a 47-year-old. Is she as beautiful as the original? No. She obviously also has a plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is a little unsightly. She does not look as soft or sincere or innocent as in the original - which is actually a wicked temptress and what is not. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to horrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a normally secure director - one who does not always do a good job but manages to make worthwhile films) has his official first real turkey delivered; In a movie, people laughed in certain moments that meant something serious. <br /> <br /> I've heard that the film has undergone several editing sessions, and that's clear from the start. Nothing makes a lot of sense. The whole plot is a cosmic chaos and the end - oh my god! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (Still predictable.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "Son of the Mask" - and although I do not want to "smear" this movie, I can say it with my own authority (which you do not.) I have to quite agree (mind you) that I prefer both films to catastrophic failure. By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started and people in the theater started throwing things at the screen during a particularly vile and insulting scene in a nightclub with orgies. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically stinks too.
