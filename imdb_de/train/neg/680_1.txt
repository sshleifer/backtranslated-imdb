I caught up with "Starlight" on TV last night and all I can say is. , , Impressive! It's hard to know where to start - the incredibly fast special effects (look at the laser beams from Willie's eyes!). The cruel drama, the cumbersome dialogue, the improper use of footage, or the atmosphere of serious presumption infuses the entire production , This is truly a unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
