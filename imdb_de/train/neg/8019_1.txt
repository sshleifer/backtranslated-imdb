I have read half a dozen other user comments on this forum and it seems like the opinions are very different. I have to agree with those who found this movie terrible. It hurts to write because I was hoping that would have been great, or I would not have bothered to see it the other day. I like to support indie cinema, especially when it comes to gay topics, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those who went out when I thought about after about three minutes probably would not mind paying out $ 11.00, or just thought that there was nowhere to go, fast and not going to improve. Maybe I am a little more optimistic than you ... either that or they have not paid to start at all. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is an idiot. He is gay. I agree. The problem is that the main character in a movie is boring does not necessarily mean that the film about him must also be boring! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid laying around like a load of laundry, restoring everything you've already learned in the first scene, the second scene, etc., etc. ... Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. Nobody says anything remotely enlightening, funny or interesting. The most terrible thing is that I did not feel the slightest sympathy for Logan. That's a big achievement. He has not grown, he has not changed, he has not learned (there is no one to teach him anything), he has done nothing and the film has not! Scene by scene, the same thing does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, the title makes no sense at all. 1.10
