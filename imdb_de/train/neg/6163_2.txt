Hooper is not funny, not fasting, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You'd think a movie about the best stuntman in the world would have some drama, there was a try, but it did not seem to be real. No character studies, no lessons learned, it did not even look as if the actors really had fun, they just tried to pretend they were having fun. There is no reason to watch, unless you want to look at Burt and occasionally take a look at Sally. Prancer's horse was beautiful and did what he should do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was such a funny movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie proved to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
