Well, I have to admit that this was one of my favorites when I saw it on a home projector as a Super 8 reel. Now there is not much to recommend, except for the inherent stock value of actors "frightened" by replicas of human skulls. The special effects are pretty stupid and usually consist of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghosting". <br /> <br /> But there is something to be said for the sets. The big mansion in which it takes place is pretty scary, especially since it's mostly unfurnished (probably for budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> However, it's definitely more laughable than screaming. Do not try to get the giggle when the woman (who wants more than shouting) goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her ex-husband.
