Fred Olen Ray is a bad director, even though B filmmakers are on the ball, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his better films. Yes, it kills the great Poe story "Premature Burial" and yes, it's bad and uneven, but it's also pretty entertaining. Scream queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual intends as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) to abolish it because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core movies of the early 90s, actually offers the best performance in the movie as a dirty mistress. You will also enjoy small roles that are played in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes of Karen Black as a clairvoyant, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman. The end did not make much sense!
