I can not believe that I have seen more. It starts very well. This film reaches the limits of reality. At least the first one was a bit realistic. It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone familiar with computers will hate this movie. However, there is good news, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER !!! The film gives the impression that Big Brother is much bigger than it really is. That was very annoying. Even the make-up of the actors was absolutely bad. Some of the acting is pretty good. Part of the acting is really bad. The script was fine in some places and completely confused elsewhere. This movie is played approximately every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I expected more. I think I will crack the original to return to earth ... Q
