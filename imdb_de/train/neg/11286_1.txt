Where do you start with a movie that is so bad? <br /> <br /> Do you mention the cast of unlikely heroes? The over-the-top actor? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> No. They just say that anyone who pays money to see a movie as poor as this one has to look at his head. I know I do. I respect those poor people who have seen it with few or no lectures from magazines like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for the high-quality movie magazines). Cinemas, however, should really consider giving refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I started with two other colleagues three days after the opening. The only other person in the cinema was a guy for himself. <br /> <br /> And that was on the cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign was unsuccessful or most of them had got around from the country, what a stinker that is. <br /> <br /> I have not felt so changed since the days of The Avengers (1998) since watching a movie. If a buddy comes up with this video in a few months, make sure he pays your utility bill while you look at him. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award if she does not give up or leave the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amidst the cinematic slaughter; Barry Foster should have been arrested for his performance on set, Rhys Ifans does not favor his career after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is reasonably sympathetic as a busty secretary. Mind you, considering you used to be in The Word, spectators' expectations of their acting skills had to be pretty low at first. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad considering the obviously limited budget, but this script is disgusting. If you want to hear a group of unlikely characters, say "Fak!" for a few hours this should be in your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise Bargepoles required. <br /> <br />
