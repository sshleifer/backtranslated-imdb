I looked at it because I thought there would be a lot of chases and cool cars to look at. I think I was lied to. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting in front of a Porsche dealer looking for the right car. When they confirm it's the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and stuffs it at the window. He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys. You start the car and drive off into the night. They deliver it to a warehouse just to be tracked by the police. The entire crew digs all the cars and goes their separate ways. Then we get a look at Memphis Raines. He gives a small talk in front of a group of kids on a go-kart track. Then he is confronted by Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in a deep * bleep *. Memphis is considered one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 in-movie hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything. The last 12 film lessons are waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You may see 10 out of 50 cars, as the movie advertises. Where are the other 40 cars? Why do not we see her? <br /> <br /> 3. The Persecution: The persecution at the end of the film was a joke. It was not exciting at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The dog: Somewhere in the movie the dog eats the burgers and also swallows three keys. That's impossible. The keys were turned on. The keys had severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach and colon. The boys suggest giving laxatives to the dog to help him hack him off. This is not going to work. The dog gets a lot of diarrhea but no keys. It was stated in Jackass when Ryan Dunne put a toy car in his rectum. Take laxatives, a lot of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The cop during the persecution: When Eleanor fails for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to get the car up. They see a police cruiser behind them, who does not look at his car at all. But when Nicholas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman shakes his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts running after him. It is stupid. So when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees the back of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I have never seen the original, but I intend to give it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 point star.
