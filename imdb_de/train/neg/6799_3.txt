Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, this film resembles a film in which Doris Day played Julie in 1956. In this film, Doris, who was a flight attendant and stewardess, landed the aircraft after her husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. She has done far better and more convincing work than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and was able to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a bit of 747 aircraft, I was a flight attendant myself. As I said, do not expect much from this movie, it was made on a cheap budget. The producers were too cheap to use an airplane with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that several films have used. The only document on this plane was the name of the company that produced the aircraft.
