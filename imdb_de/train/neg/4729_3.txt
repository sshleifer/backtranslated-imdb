LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis' craziest films. Partial slapstick, partly lint, partly surreal and partly weird. Elvis meets with a very off-beat girl with a annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense, as is the case with most Elvis Presley films, and there are a lot of weird characters there. Not much music in this, but what I liked, though not memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go to their beach house at night, but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it's clear daylight !! What?? That's about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) the dog steals the show.
