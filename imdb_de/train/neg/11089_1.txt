Pretty good movie, but no true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder, and was never found guilty. The state of New Jersey did not do it a third time when 20 years had passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass the lie test and go free". He did not take it. This movie should never have been done, but money talks. Many people have wrongly spent their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than whites. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
