Lindsay Anderson was to a large extent a European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make spectacular films with visual scope. Anderson's film is more concerned with social commentary and subtext, so the message will often end up throughout the movie, whose main task should be entertaining the audience. <br /> <br /> What you think of IF depends on it What you think of British filmmakers. I strongly believe that cinema should be a universal medium (the best British films are those that I think would like to imitate Hollywood). If you want to send a message, try Pony Express, and I find the movie dated, overbearing, and too much set in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of the student uprising in France. You can imagine every French left worshiping this film, especially its climax. French New Wave filmmakers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will not like it
