Be warned: This film tells a lot of love stories without context. <br /> <br /> The sole purpose of this film is to show love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no action. Just a sketchy idea of ​​a conspiracy. The author attempted to incorporate turning points that should surprise the viewer. But that did not work because you did not know the characters before or these "jokes" were just stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
