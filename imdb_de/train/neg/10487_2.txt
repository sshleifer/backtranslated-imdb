OH MY GOD! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as Elvis-in-the-Box. Besides, how did this halfway decent cast-sign decide to make such a lame film? Maybe it seemed like a good idea then ... There are no laughter to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably lies with director Joel Zwick. He brings from all involved only poppy achievements. Do not waste your time like me; but then I enjoy a good train accident. Gosh, now the system tells me I need more lines - here's it: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now that was funnier than anything in the movie ...
