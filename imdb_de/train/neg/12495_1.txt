OK, I love evil horror. Above all, I love horror so much that I can make fun of it. Demonicus or House of the Dead - that was bad enough to make fun of it. Severed was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler - who cares?) <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> My friend and I sat through the whole movie and I have a bunch of comments, both in the "this sucks" style as well as in the area of ​​current criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot (one of a kind) - There is a man in this city (possibly Seattle) comment below) who runs around and cuts off heads. He has been doing this for over a year (I will not go back to get accurate numbers - thank you very much for your thanks), maybe two or three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST calling a "specialist" (once calling himself a clairvoyant, but that will never happen again). <br /> <br /> Schya, right! Feds take over, what, THREE killings? After almost one hundred percent killings we would stand under war face !!!!! Anyway, this "specialist" questions the voodoo chick that the police ignored all the time, and the two of them conclude that Baron Samedi, a voodoo ghost, heads off to gain enough strength to make yourself a body (and then presumably conquer the world - or possibly just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> To. <br /> <br /> Attitude - where does that happen? If you are not from Seattle, you may not know that there is a local radio station poster in Bar / Rave (staffed by about ten employees of the film crew and their family members) and that in the entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" dialogues (as IF) between the two cops (yes, those who let their heads down after fifteen minutes) discuss the "new stadium" that might have been a problem at the time The movie was made. <br /> <br /> I'm from Seattle, apologize on behalf of the movie and shame my head. <br /> <br /> OK, here it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, do not look for my name in IMDb), I research. A lot of research. And unlike the authors of this film, I know that while a Voudon Loa (ghost) guarding the cemeteries and traditionally associated with "Satan" (by various Christian oppressors), Baron Samedi is a "Loki" -like Trickster is god. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not cut heads. <br /> <br /> Also, a key part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies focus on the ownership of various members of the assembly through the Loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if he has already owned someone, then why make a NEW corpse? <br /> <br /> Even if Baron Samedi got a body, he would not walk around and cut heads. He would get good rum and cigars and par-tay. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only thing they did (surprisingly) is that when reading the tarot card completely unnecessarily (just to show that the voodoo chick is "scary"), they are the interpretations of the Cards do not mess like most movies have. Again I researched. (Who still remembers the old late-night ad for tarot phone readings - "The lovers - you'll soon fall in love with crazy ..." and all the nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you can I congratulate you with my comments. And I'm sorry again. I'm sorry if you feel like watching the movie for me, so please do not.
