Nacho Vigalondo is well known in Spain. He's a kind of bad showman who can make you sick ... very embarrassing. Nacho had done some commercials on television, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney near Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like the commercial of a nacho: bad plot, bad direction and terrible performances. I can not believe such a disgusting movie was in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... Nacho made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman who is very well connected to Spanish TV business people.
