But it has some good action and an action that is interesting. Nevsky behaves like a bodybuilder, and he is not particularly attractive, IMO he is UGLY. (His acting skills are lacking!) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, and her character had to be developed. There are far too many men in this story, no romance, too much action and far too stupid ending. It is very violent. However, I loved the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world and that's a bonus. I also liked how it had something about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors had to be nicer ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal and not sexy enough. I think for most guys Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies who are action fans, Nevsky just will not cut it off. All in all, this movie was okay, I did not love it or hated it, I just thought it was a regular action movie.
