I doubt this will ever be a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be safe and I did not expect much from this movie and got even less. What could have been smarter and more moving was campy. It was free of the music that made grief, and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background to grief or the colorful people of that time. The featured characters did not even trust me as a fan of Grams and all the versions of his "afterlife adventures" I've heard. Rock and Roll is full of stories, too good, but they should be taken with a salt of salt. They can be great stories, even if they are exaggerated. However, this movie had a good story and turned into Tripe. Stealing a corpse and its consequences should not be a boring story, but they somehow made it boring. I'm tempted to steal every issue of Grand Theft Parsons, go into the desert and burn them all.
