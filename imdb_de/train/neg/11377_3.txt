OK. For a start, the taxi driver is incredible. This is not a taxi driver or amazing. what it is is bad. but I found it very funny, which meant that it had some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue ... wow. There was more or less no action, the characters were all stupid and the movie was preaching. There were places where I thought the movie would plunge into violent taxi drivers, which would have hit the message more heavily at the end of the movie. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this movie. Yes, it pays to look if you are really bored and you want to confirm the fact that anyone can, or at least try, make a movie.
