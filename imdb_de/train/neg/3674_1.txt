Note: I'll reveal an important part of the storyline, but if you've looked at the DVD cover or other promotional material, you already know it. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to be leading the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that these masters of intelligence are chasing someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute if they do not wear protective clothing (not even gloves). These are minor things related to this movie. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes to the side. <br /> <br /> The fact is that people in this film (with a few exceptions) do not behave the way people behave. Almost every time a character reacts to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes soap opera scripts like Shakespeare appear. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we were wasting a free movie rental on this thing.
