Italian horror / suspense movie about a wealthy English lord who crosses pubs and taverns for girls with red hair, just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. They know that he must have truly loved his wife for bringing her home - a huge, rotting castle - which she undresses and tortures, tortures, whips and kills. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me was that this guy is somehow played by Antonio De Teffe as HERO of the movie at the end of the movie. However, under the advice of his playboy Uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe soon meets a girl whom he meets at his uncle's party. It moves in and strange things happen in De Teffes fragile mentality. He begins to see and hear his dead wife, and finally, look at the title, if you are still curious. Also family members and friends die in the most brutal way. Poor Aunt Agatha (she looks like she's even younger than De Teffe and they've got her in a wheelchair trying to look old) foxy way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there's a whole explanation why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some pretty good things: The settings in the film are well suited for this film, though it's trying to believe that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors looks English. Many with dark black hair and a Mediterranean complexion and clothes dressed in English would not be killed. The cars drive on the wrong side of the road. Nevertheless, the crypt scene was effectively rotated and I also liked the cheesy resolution. And of course every movie with the sultry, red-haired Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a consequence of sexual perversion; Somewhat appalling, however, I found the idea that torturing women was all right and healthy to relieve one of his mental demons. Come on.
