After seeing Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it, I finally had a chance to see the continuation of Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed as it could not nearly withstand the high standards of the first one. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their heads is not my idea of ​​a good movie. The Philip Glass rating for this score had neither the beauty nor the correlating power of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this movie was slow and meaningless. A watered-down version of Baraka that's the same idea, but made better. I really hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
