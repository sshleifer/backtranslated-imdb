Vodka Lemon is a charming but extremely odd Arminian film that will delight and bore some. Although reasonably well done, the film lacks any "zing," and instead relies on many scenes that will appear commonplace to the astute Kunsthaus viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of cinematic brilliance that unfortunately merit a movie worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and set itself alight to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately angry. They can laugh, but these moments are few and far between, amidst a sea of ​​snowy landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort that ultimately comes from the lack of narrative cohesion.
