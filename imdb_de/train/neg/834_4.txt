I have found that this is an absolute waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney creates a lack of creativity when creating movies directly related to the video - but upgrading the original movie conspiracy with a "new perspective" is an absolute low ... the original movies with new animations and to release new songs and call them "the new version of the movie we all love". Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to Timon. Timon and Pumbaa, the animated animals from the world of the original "Lion King," embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story as it REALLY happened ... as they see it. Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but when was the last time you remembered that Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane was anything of real commercial substance? Overall, if you liked the original, you will hate this. It is offensive because it is unfair for both children and adults. And that sums it up.
