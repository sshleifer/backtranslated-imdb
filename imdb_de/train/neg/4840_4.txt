This movie should have lasted a maximum of 45 minutes. Although an interesting concept / theme, it really did not evolve as a story. Once the first idea of ​​a brave (stupid) bomb disposal expert (cowboys) has been introduced, and this happens very early in the movie, the rest is repetitive. Characters were not explored and aspects of the place and politics were ignored. There were some beautiful insights into the dreadful difficulties faced by troops in such a strange environment, and the difficulties of distinguishing between friend and foe. But the way in which the unit operated has stretched the faith! The individual performances were good and the special effects were sufficient, but not enough to overcome the fundamental lack of content.
