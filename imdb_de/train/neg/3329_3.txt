Take your Frankenstein movie, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts) and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Obviously, this was obviously inspired by the films mentioned above, but it never comes across as something special. A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie plays during a night while trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut body parts off some women who are stranded and decides to spend the night with him stay. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that acting is bad, nor is the direction. Everything here is just too standard. What little attempts are there in humor? (Look at the scene where Hackenstein hides behind his deaf assistant, because she would undoubtedly be very excited about picking up a woman and a needle), but that's barely enough for this movie recommend. The music is decent, the blood is decent and the cast looks pretty good. And half of the time, this movie has even entertained me. But I never had the feeling that this was more than a waste of time. Preventable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
