What I found so curious about this film - I've seen the full 4-hour roadshow version is how strangely dispassionate it is. For a movie about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, who were in a huge political fight, it is almost completely free from emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who in the best case is a second-level actor, with a slightly high-pitched voice), have no drama or depth and basically come to Castro, who says Che: go here, go there, do that and that There is no explanation as to what effect or what effect this action will have. Odder is still an actor in the cast who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he is seconded in the supporting role. Without the excitement or passion you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a boring, epic movie about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles, screaming and shooting for no purpose at all. Some of the reviews I read praised director Steven Soderbergh's work, while the actors were almost completely ignored. (In fact, one person has spoken more about Soderbergh's new digital movie camera than about the storyline or the actors, or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a curious, weird thing, since a) Soderbergh was just a weapon in the film and b) it is nothing more than a competent work, with an imperceptible allusion to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white disassembled camera work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Andrew McLaglen's Reds instead of Warren Beatty, you could get a glimpse of the film's boring expertise.
