Despite the elaborate production figures and wonderful costumes, this film is a chore. The murder-mystery conspiracy is just a vehicle on which to place the musical numbers, but it often brings the process to a stunning stagnation, except it's not very involved. Although obviously a lot of money was spent on them, the numbers are poorly staged and poorly photographed. It's obviously a pre-code movie because the girls often wear very little clothes and even a song sings the praise of marijuana! The performances are all one touch, though it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, police lieutenant, comes in search of clues for the umpteenth time, you may want to throw in the towel or fast forward to the next number. Pity for the patrons who were caught in the cinema when they were released!
