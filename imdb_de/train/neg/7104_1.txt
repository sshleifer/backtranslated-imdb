The producers of this film offer the opportunity to pay funeral expenses to anyone who dies of fright during the movie. You should offer intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. A young couple moves into a house where a woman lived that looks like the couple's wife. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, I did not care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
