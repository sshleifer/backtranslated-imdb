The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with glitches, accidents and destruction that are mostly caused by Stan, but Ollie gets the bulk (!) Of the punishment - see the great "The Music Box" (1933) or 'Looped in a Hole' (1932) as classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, for some reason (because it was based on a sketch by Stan's dad), the guys are playing it "in a" comedy "that focuses on jokes and supposedly funny situations It 's just another boring comedy from the' 30s, reinforced only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie, who never show their trademarked gestures (Ollie 's finger wobbles, Stan' s blank looks, etc) or comic skills br /> <br /> The movie starts with the police running in. Because we never see or know why, it is hard to believe or accept that they are afraid of being caught, and therefore they are in Colonel Buckshot's Villa Hidden The premise for the "humor", Ollie pretended to be Colonel and Stan as a butler and maid, they do not play "Stan and Ollie" in this movie, their roles were played by one of the pedestrian studio actors expectant and it would be just as poor. Stan could mime and do whatever he would make fun of, but he does not get the opportunity to do any of this here. He is forced to utter too many dialogues to "move" the plot, but none of this raises much about the stupid. We are served with endless comedy chestnuts of the third rank, such as the running gag not to pronounce Lord Plumtree's name correctly: "Call me a taxi! Okay, you're a taxi!" Joking, cops lose their clothes and are seen in long underpants, and a non-sequestering end of Stan and Ollie as both parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they flee for two on a bike, and James Finlayson still does it Silence Whole Body takes Keystone Kop up in the air. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie get a lot better in a situation comedy in 'Sons of the Desert' (1933), in which we see them see what we do love about them - be them themselves 1932 to 1934 to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this movie does not play any of its strengths, why should he care? I have to give a 3
