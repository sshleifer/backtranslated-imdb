And a self-recognized to boot. At one point, the assistant's doctor describes himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> With the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this movie does not need time to explore the premise. Most of the time the screen is divided into a domestic confrontation with a girlfriend in a coma and the persecution of the murderer of brain donors. It tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but does not deliver any of the three. <br /> <br /> As a Frankenstein remake, this one lacks all that the original has done well. Nobody calls the doctor crazy or even threatens to throw him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye, and the amazing computer that enables it is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when things go wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any tension over who might be the killer is shattered by gradually showing him in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding the killer is so easy to open a file and question a person. San Francisco, as attitudes are both overrated and underused. The opening sequence poundes the point where this happens in SF, a cable car plays a major role, the lines live in a Victorian hill, Pier 39 occurs and the final showdown takes place at Golden Gate Park. More specifically, along a ten-foot-high cliff at the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the obvious scenarios are rounded, no further attempt is made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> Actors are the only salvation here. Keir Dullea shows a good range and shows some really emotional scenes. Suzanna Love portrays the recovery well. Tony Curtis gets only a handful of lines and twice as many nasty guys, while most francscience are explained by his assistant. The little blond boy is also pretty good on his cues. <br /> <br /> I also gave him an extra star for the scene where the man drives from the bridge to the south. It's a U-turn on an independent car park and then it's right back on the bridge heading north. It requires a great deal of something - bravery, ignorance, deadlines - to escape the viewer during a single chase.
