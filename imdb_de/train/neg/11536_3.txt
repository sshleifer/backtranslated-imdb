Now where should I start? Straightheads presents me with a little dilemma. If this movie came out of Italy around 1975, it was directed by Ruggero Deodatto and played with David Hess in the lead role, then I would have drunk faster than Labrador's water on a summer's day. While Tarantino and Rodriguez are elsewhere paying homage to Grindhouse Cinema, Dan Reed has produced his own Rape / Revenge Grindhouse image in England, which apparently had the same budget as Rodriguez Rose McGowan's leg turned a machine gun. If you want to play Grindhouse Bingo, then let me call the "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. A rich, high-flying career woman implausibly hits the wrong side of the line and, just as implausibly, the shots for him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Free shots of the high-flying career woman in various states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Convoluted and highly unlikely plot development, which sets up characters that only serve to do what they do, and which one can not imagine being outside the scenes in which they are, exist. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. Needless graphic rape scene, committed by a group of men with no apparent depth of personality or background who can not be raped. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Grim and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to top it all off. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotting wise, Straightheads is pretty simple: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party on a pile of land owned by her boss. On the way home, they angered three locals in a Landover who avenge themselves by giving Dyer a good shoe and raping Anderson. The couple then set out to take revenge. So far "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the edge of the park", "I spit on your grave" etc. etc. Why did not I think much about this movie? A number of reasons: I think, first of all, that Gillian Anderson's prima facie cast has led me to better results, but it's the total lack of honesty here, as most do. <br /> <br /> Because someone always sits down to watch Hess and his men terrorize women in the 70s and murder their husbands. Then they always know exactly what they are getting - low-budget quickies designed to shatter and address the lowest common denominator. The bad guys terrorize and murder the treats, the treats turn the tables over to the bad guys and kill them back, and everyone goes home satisfied, their desire to see a little bit of evil violence, knowing that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, as a writer and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads has far more to say about the state of the human psyche than desperate, and desperately tries to give his film a philosophical depth that simply does not there is . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of desire for the two men he hangs out with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he admits that he raped her just as a distraction, so that his two comrades would distract himself from his daughter !!! The casual and bold way in which Reed puts this little revelation into the plot is simply mind-boggling. It's almost as if he expects this simple hint of pedophilia to be enough to overdrive the audience's moral compass, and the cinema thinks they're thinking I've just eaten something important. To make sure we understand it, a rape pass will be shown here a second time, allegedly from the point of view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed ensures that we get more shots from Anderson and roughly treated raped the hood of her car. Involuntarily, it does not go in. <br /> <br /> After Anderson was told why he raped her, Anderson ties him over a table and rams the business end of a sniper rifle (complete with a bulky muffler just in case someone was not The Phallic Images are not clear, but he lacks the courage to pull the trigger, and tells Dyer (who has no moral qualms) that "it's over." Dyer argues differently and her moral dilemma is portrayed as something that Wittgenstein and Russell in her rooms in Cambridge have discussed tea and cake, which is almost ridiculous in its ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Ms. Anderson appears throughout the movie, and it's obvious that she's far from Scully She wants to leave her behind and bless her, she definitely does, wondering what Mulder would have done to his former partner, who squats down to make a hole on the side of the road and then one Man throwing a gun in the cheek? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he did in virtually every movie he's done to date-that is, he plays a merciless Guv-Cockney-type chappie with a mischievous grin, a cheeky hiss, and a face that most people do People would never get tired of beating This is especially true of the final scene, where Dyer, after killing his assailants in cold blood, looks into the camera, which I am sure is an expression of existential agony that invites us to sympathize with the hand destiny He dealt with it and the moral disagreements he had to overcome, but he remembers much more that Oliver Hardy looks annoyed at the camera after Stan landed him in another mess. By the way, this movie pretty much summarizes.
