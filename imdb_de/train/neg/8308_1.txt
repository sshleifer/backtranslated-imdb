Entertainment Tonight has gone down the hill in recent years, but since yesterday evening (August 17, 2006) they have reached a new low. <br /> <br /> To try and run their show, they decided to post current photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers ... "Pictures from the case you've never seen before". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was at the side of her face and head / neck and one could clearly see the cord that was choking her around her neck and bruising on her face. That was so terrible, I could not believe it. How does this have to do with ALL who have to deal with Hollywood Entertainment remotely? Nothing!! They have lowered their dignity and values ​​to a new low ... and that shows. It used to be the premiere you had to watch ... and now it's just garbage. <br /> <br /> I will see Access Hollywood from now on.
