(There are spoilers) The murderous nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over the life and the car of the virgin 18, even if it is too embarrassing for her, collage newcomers Trent Colbert and Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the film, Myia defiles poor, innocent and naive Trent not just a lesson on how to spot dangerous madmen and stay away from him or her as much as possible so he does not become one. <br /> <br /> Miya is hanged at a trucker rest area and picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for hot and heavy action in the backseat of his stroller. Roy is either too drunk or too stupid to realize that Miya is none other than his alienated daughter! Angry that Miya is reluctant to join him, Roy nearly strangles her to death, only to be interrupted by collage student Trent Colbert in the first year, who plows into the rest area and steals one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Your chance sees Miya jump in Trent's car, and they start the craziest car chase ever made in a movie. Throughout the northeastern United States, the two were thrown into a truck wagon that unleashed a murder and shootout with the state forces, leading them home to Trent's parents, where they were held hostage. There is another wild shootout between the insane Miya and an entire SWAT team, reinforced by local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You would expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentionally or unintentionally funny, but that's not the case. In fact, the movie is very disturbing in the way Miya treats everyone in the film, in which she comes in contact with her perverted and child-graying father Roy. When Trent gets her to drive her northeast, Miya gets the poor slut carrying him in a motel room with whip handcuffs and a burning candle. Miya also does it with the motel owner, the horny Mr. Foster, by tempting him to give her the gun as part of a weird sex game. After stopping Foster, she sets off with Trent's, who is cold in his motel room, carrying a wallet of some $ 400, but he does not bother to drive his car away. <br /> <br /> To pay for petrol to come to his parents for Thanksgiving, Trent receives a call from Miya on his cell phone to pick up at a local restaurant to get his money back. Like the idiot that he is Trent, Miya, who has now escaped from the law, resorts to and later gets involved in the street with her father Roy as he tries to run both Trent and Miya off the street. <br /> <br /> The persecution ends in this abandoned house where Roy Miya hunts, chases him out on stiletto heels on a muddy street, and with him in the know where to find him with a blast from him Roy's own shotgun was so busy taking off his pants that he forgot to leave the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With a robbery and murder and a stroke against them, the two desperados in a S & M / Tattoo boutique station where Trent pierces his ear and nose, gets leather and chains from Myri together with a matching collar for him and her. This is to meet his straightforward and conservative parents for Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> After a shooting shootout with the State Troopers, one of which was badly injured, the two refugees land the law by Trent's parents, Mr. & Mrs. Colbet, David Keith, and Elaine Martyn all land Police with a SWAT team are waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> Incredible movie with a truly disturbing ending, where you wonder what exactly the movie really wanted to do to inform the audience. They had a lot of compassion for Miya at first, but when the movie ended, it ended as fast as a tray of ice cubes in Death Valley. Although Roy was the most unusual person in the film at the beginning of the film, Miya completely supplanted him.
