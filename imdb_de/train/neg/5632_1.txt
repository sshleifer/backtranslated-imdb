I watched the DVD (known in the US as BLACK WIDOW) and then felt it was really a horrible movie. But they must have cut out a lot from the original film, or I have missed a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a chest), but I read some other comments on IMDb.com mentioning vulgarity and something about a tampon. I have not seen anything like that, just a bad, boring movie with unusual characters and a banal, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth or botoxed to the gills, and only one expression touches her face. And her name makes me think of an oversized drink at Taco Bell: "I'll have the Cola Grande!" It was really fun, it was so bad that I could play as if I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I've found that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It really is like a stupid putty!
