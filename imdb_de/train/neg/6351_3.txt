Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was a good show - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - this was simply not an exciting movie. The separation between the comedy part and the tragedy part was unpleasant or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the support bandage differs in the two halves; I thought, with the way things were presented in the opening scene, that the people surrounding Melinda would be the same people and just react differently (more like a "he said, she said" premise). What we have, however, are two completely different stories and two completely different women, both played randomly by Radha Mitchell. The two dramatists in the opening scene - the comedian and the tragedy - supposedly take the same premise and go on from there, but the two stories are only tenaciously related. They do not support the discussion topic very much, ie almost everything can be considered a comedy or a tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing movie.
