A stupid, rich man around 1800 wants to visit a nearby madhouse to see how a famous doctor looks after his patients. Despite an initially hostile reaction, he is soon invited cordially and visited by the good doctor. And as the doctor shows him, he talks, talks and talks !!! And as he talks, Loonies run amuck here and there and do not do anything particularly productive. There are SOME actions here and there (and some of them are quite disturbing), but it's amazing how boring and cerebral the whole thing is - lacking in life and energy, which is unusual for a horror movie. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one gets pretty tiring. The further this tour leads the guest, the more disturbing it becomes, until you finally find out that the inmates have taken over the hospital and tortured their owners. Despite this twist, the movie is amazingly lifeless in many places - especially if it moves very slowly, because a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people just walk around the set. Only if the asylum workers are found starved in a prison cell, the film has a real effect. Given this conspiracy, it's hard to imagine it getting boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitation film have it! Well, with the same plot and competent writing, acting and directing, this movie was an interesting and worthwhile movie. You know, now that I think about it, this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original "Star Trek" TV show! You know, the one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are being held captive by this madman and his crazy followers. One final note: The movie has a lot of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be warned - it's not for kids. Considering how worthless the movie is, it is not suitable for anyone! However, with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the pressure is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this meat because the pressure is so dark.
