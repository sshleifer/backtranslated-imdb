I was one of the few non-liberals to watch Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... with the propaganda film and the boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the film might be a documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be the case. Be another liberal, brutal effort to beat up conservatives and the local religious community. For a filmmaker, it seems natural to make a documentary that only reflects his prejudices about subjects. <br /> <br /> What's even more surprising are all the '10' votes his homosexuals have posted here. Did you even see the video? Golly gee Batman, that must be All The President's Men! Your reviews are as obvious as the prejudices in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, stacking the voices on IMDb would help a lame movie. Maybe my voice will help to make up for it.
