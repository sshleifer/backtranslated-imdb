This movie delivers. Best of all, when the clumsy teenage neighbor tries to get away from the babysitter, in the background it looks as if he has never been near a bicycle when he tries not to fall off. <br /> <br /> But this movie There it does not stop, when less than 5 minutes later there is a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence into a cool box and pulling out a beer. <br /> <br /> stereotypical grilled fathers, multiple plot lines that go nowhere, and a former SeaQuest actress with Bluetooth cell phone make this a perfect Saturday night home.
