An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of duty, but she rejects him and decides to raise the child alone. Things are going fine until the kid named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things are starting to get worse (and predictably). <br /> <br /> I have seen both the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". None of them influenced me very much (and I cry easily), but they were well done when they were dated. Having tried to restore it in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I suspect Midler had enough strength after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to achieve this. This (predictably) bombarded. History is ridiculous and dated by today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado are performing well, this movie really sucks and I was bored in the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help to support roles. Thin and boring. Really - who thought that would work? Instead, see the Stanwyck version of 1937. I give this a 1.
