I'm pretty sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can not make a 13-year-old boy laugh out of silly humor, you should give up the comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers has made another choice. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of them are racist) and very listless jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this, I can not believe that this was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctor's desk and tries to give it from mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punchline that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is, "I knew I should have been up there." ha ha ha ah ah ugh ........
