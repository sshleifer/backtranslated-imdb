The main reason why people are still "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." interested. is that it plays Peter Sellers in a second role. But it is a mistake to see Peter Sellers in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sellers plays Amphibulos, a vaguely reptilian Prime Minister of the low-land island state of Gaillardia, a former British colony that now has a lot of Russian excavators during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both British and Soviet interests against each other to facilitate the win, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat eager to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten her, on the contrary. <br /> <br /> One positive review says, "The reason for this movie is considered average because the comedy is understated." I would argue that the reason for "Carlton-Browne" is below average because of the Comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that defines the two strengths of the film, a sympathetically foolish Terry-Thomas and John Addison's indescribable Larky score slow things down quickly into a series of slow burns and lame misunderstanding jokes. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne of his boss and the darkness of Gaillardia (which no one can find on a map) is milked to death. By the time we actually reach the island (after a series of jokes about Airsicks), expectations are pretty low. <br /> <br /> But they are still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist in either Latin America or the Mediterranean, is so miserable that its honor guard faints at the airport, and the test stand falls apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still pulled by horses, which allows another lame auditory scream from a heavily accented announcer: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers are never the center of attention, even if we are in the limelight. are on the island of his character. The plot is instead taken over by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the assassination of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his role as straightforward as written. Normally, this would make him the likely target to steal from Sellers scene, but trapped behind a thick accent and a greasy mustache. Sellers is only a threat to those of us who are much happier in two other films shot in the same year. "The Mouse That Roared" and "I'm fine, Jack." <br /> <br /> It's strange that this movie, like "Jack," was a Boulting Brothers production, with Roy Boulting as co-director Jeffrey Dell , Boulting films usually combine evil social satire with comic comedies, but there are only Fey-Jabs in every direction. Amphibulos works with his mangled English vibe for all his value ("This man is like, how do you say, the bull in the Chinese ship"), while Carlton-Browne is generally stoked far more by his superior than he deserves. <br /> <br /> The weakest and tedious element of the film is the young Loris romance with Ilyena. Score a point by enchanting Luciana Paluzzi put one on, as they seemingly are never cousins. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a lame staged revolution whose surprising solution will not surprise anyone and one last action by Carlton-Browne that literally seemed to close the casket lid. Apparently he lives another day, but the movie with the same name is strictly DOA.
