I can not help but I like movies that are scary and just bad. I personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right among the creatures of the Abyss. Watch this movie and have a laugh. Just do not expect academy prizes for acting. More chance to understand the movie itself. In all honesty, however, I have seen much worse. There are also some madmen driving around in the desert and wiping out the same people who just died. I think it's one of those love or hate movies. You can decide for yourself, yes, it's terrible, but it somehow pulls off, that's why I love it
