1 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that you can not believe you've just had 2 hours of your life wasted on seeing the role of the credits. I honestly think I could make a better vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that not only sucks (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a bit cool, has some puzzles and kicking his ass a bit.
