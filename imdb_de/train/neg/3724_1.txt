I saw this movie twice in a Pentecostal church where my family participated in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was at the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again, when I was 8, my brother 6. This movie scared my brother and me and shaped how we view the world with mistrust. It was not just the film, it was the philosophy that devoured so many "Christians" with the "sign of the beast" and the rapture. This film, the church and a fickle, careless upbringing lead to heavy paranoia towards the future. For years I lived under the delusional influences of the Church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Gone through years of consulting. I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and the family. I was associated with a deception disorder. I actually believed that, it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy was actually happening. I am no longer afraid of the future, I have dealt with the fear that the Church has received from its members. I have had this experience to fulfill a purpose, I am about to graduate as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
