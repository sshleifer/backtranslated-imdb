I've rented this thinking, it could be interesting, and it could have been an interesting story, except that it was narrated in such an uninteresting way. Hard to follow, strange editing, incoherent plot, mumbling the characters, all in all a terribly boring waste of time. I just could not deal with it and I did not care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save this movie. If you do not need a cure for insomnia, I would skip it. 3/10, and that's generous.
