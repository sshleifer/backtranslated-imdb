I felt obliged to go through this movie the whole way, since I had found it in a bargain basket and bought it for myself, but I often came too close to turn it off and simply write off the money I had paid for it. If you're a fan of anger and sadism, this movie is fine. If there is one thing the creators of this film know, then it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts that have a morbid effect. If that does not impress you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This film is shot with a home video camera, with props for elementary school and terrible actors. It's translated from German, but even considering that, the sound is awful. This movie is about as good as the budget, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the movie might have been a bit more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men landing on an inhabited island by an army of tin-masked sadists. They are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their escape attempt. I call this a story in the lighthearted sense, as it is really a series of torture and fighting scenes filled through a dialogue with crazy obscenities like a brainless neck. Consider yourself warned.
