Many horror fans seem to love scarecrows, so I will not be very popular when I say it's pretty boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to be so. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies shot in the dark can work (like Humongous), but scarecrows are in darkness throughout the movie. Often it's hard to figure out what's actually going on, and although scans were scary, most were hard to spot. If a little more lighting had been used, it might have been better. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, there are not many movies with Killers, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend this every day about scarecrows.
