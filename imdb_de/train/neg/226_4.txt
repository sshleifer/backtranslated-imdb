Andie McDowell is as beautiful as the 40-year-old woman, whose later start with a serious relationship leads her to a much younger man and a consecutive breakup with two longtime best friends. <br /> <br /> A gigolo / gold digger in the sincere young man, the "girlfriends" who are dead with the cessation of this "stupid relationship" go beyond the call of duty by helping their friend " <br /> <br /> A short sequence of situations is absolutely ridiculous, far-fetched, it does not cover up anymore, and without these incredible scenes, there could be hope for a sweet love story Instead, the viewer is left with an involuntary shake of the head - these things just do not happen! Without giving up the details of the cliffs, I warn the viewer of high expectations for this movie, most (like me) will be very disappointed in the scale of 1 to 10, this is a weak 4. For me there is much better material is not worth your time
