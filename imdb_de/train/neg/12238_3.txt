A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday symbols together, but ... Rudolph's fiery nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this film - much like The Force needed in The Star Wars Movies not the explanation of "medichlorians in the blood". Above all, the movie left me cold because Winterbolt was too complicated to destroy Santa Claus. He has the power to bring suggestions into people's minds. Why does he make things so awkward? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, melting the Frosty family ... The hilarious exaggerations of Pinky and the Brain and "Phineas and Ferb," ​​dr. Compared to Winterbolt, they seem to be simple and uncomplicated, which is expected to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a figure throws its two pistols at the evil, like boomerangs. I understand if they do not want guns shot in a family movie, but why do they have weapons at all?
