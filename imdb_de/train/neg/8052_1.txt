I was sitting by this turkey because I had not seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential. It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are completely upright and no leaf moves! When the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that point, the beliefs the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the heavily localized rain in their film. Too bad that not all hurricanes are like this, it would certainly help our homeowner insurance rates here in the Sunshine State.
