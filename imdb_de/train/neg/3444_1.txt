This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Action, though recordings, "special effects", acting, and I mentioned action? Every single thing sucked in this ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "overdoing" means and I'm trying to explain it: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator is trying to do from this movie; This should be one of those movies, you can not really say what the hell is going on. You are fascinated and do not know who is dead and who lives and who killed, and why, and if you think you've found the right timeline, find out you're wrong and the movie ends - and you stay for the next 5 minutes with open mouth! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job," if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, yes, Olga? The author, director, producer, scriptwriter, caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes ... this is basically a one-woman movie and when it comes to Olga Levens " Levens Productions "You can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, that could be a shock, but" this time "Olga made this big time, jumping from scene to scene, from dreams to reality .. . but wait! that was all a dream ... or was it? The picture fades and I realized that none of it happened. The girl was alone on the ship ... actually there was no ship ... no wait! There's the ship and the boys again! You live! Thank God! No, they call to take part in the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they are dead ??? or maybe they never lived at the beginning? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I've just said, you may like this movie - otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason I burned all this crap is Find out how Hell, you can end this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at it if you value time, because 90 minutes is a waste in this case ...
