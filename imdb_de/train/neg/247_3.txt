It was 9:30 pm last night in my friend's caravan and we were so excited to see South Park (a new episode). In my country, South Park is broadcast at 10:30 pm, and we decided to kill time by watching the broadcast now being broadcast, Father of Pride. I start by only looking at episodes. The first time I saw it, I did not find it nude and rude, so I thought, "Holy, I have a football game tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons." But yesterday I tried to give the father of pride a second chance. I think it's a complete rip-off of the Simpsons and instead only replaces yellow human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing is, I wonder why it got the TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity on this show are a few homosexual (listless) jokes. The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series also staged Shrek 2. Well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was a lot better and I think he was too busy with the topic of family. However, I have to admit that the Father of Pride made me smile (even laugh) three or four times. <br /> <br /> All in all, the father of pride does not bother me. I do not hate it, but I do not like it. I've seen better from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
