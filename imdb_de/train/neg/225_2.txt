SPOILER: Young lover Jed is driven out by Kate (Andie McDowell) for falsely believing that Jed has an affair with one of her two friends. Kate thought she had caught her in the Flagrante Delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed goes abruptly and then sits in the middle of the street to put on his shoes. Then he is hit by a truck ("Crushed", one of the meaning of the title). And dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets run over by a truck." Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plotelement? Until then, it's a comedy that wants to be frothy but does not have a real soda. Everyone but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and all are sad, to the point where women learn to love each other and be supportive rather than being destructive. I give it 2 ughs.
