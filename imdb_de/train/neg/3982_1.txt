For the love of God please do not see this movie! It is a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. This movie and its evil predictable villain try to build with very little too much. The characters are undeveloped, and most of the film is filled with footage from Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual movie. To top it all off, acting is a shame. I know that everyone is trying to find their niche, but that's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone actually paid many millions of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, visit your grandma or something worthwhile instead.
