They are not journalists like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from His Girl Friday, or witty detective William Powell and cheeky lady Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur thugs in Scoop. Her screwball-repartee is postmodern rather than post-depression. Allen's writing is full of ironic self-deprecation and plain old New York fear. Shadows of the old joke are rare, for example when he answers as Sid, the great Splendini magician, about his background: "I was born into the Hebrew belief, but when I got older I converted to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, turns out to be a relatively good, sometimes grim journalist who has fallen into a London-based murder mystery: a serial killer. The storyline is a reworking of its recent London-based thriller Match Point, right up to the sins of the upper class and the "American Tragedy / Place in the Sun" disaster. In fact, Allen revises the Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo, to name but a few. I do not care if he does it. I want the new material to be at least equivalent to the originals, and unfortunately it reflects only its younger size. Allen's as a director and actor his love can not hide the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore brings a medium-sized comedy into a suitable place in the Allen canon, not grand but amusing, sometimes brilliantly satirical "I would be very surprised if he would kill a person. " This is Vintage Allen humor. While there are hardly any literary allusions, as in most of his films, he lurks Scoop with music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know that the Woodman has not lost his class.
