If I look at it again after many years and remember the flop after its original release, I'm surprised how well it lasted. One of the reasons for the failure was that one generation simply thought it was excessive crap, and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show full hippie fame. Now it is clear that Antonioni already knew and was fascinated by the intoxicating mixture of passion for change and a lack of a clear vision of the future. The main couple is excellent and it is shameful that they used so much flak for the perceived failure of the movie. They are ideal and convey the various contradictions perfectly and show the pure joy of lovemaking. I blame others for overemphasizing the student revolt sequences in the beginning, but I must say that from now on one of the most beautiful images of the director is and he has certainly made the most of the man-made and natural landscapes. Oh, and I did not even mention the high explosive end.
