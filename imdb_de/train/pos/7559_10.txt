This movie is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this must be one of the better films I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is just incredible and Loren Dean plays a crazy, spoiled movie star. The plot is great too. It's all very real, which is scary. It says it's a drama, but this is one of the damn funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go and look at it.
