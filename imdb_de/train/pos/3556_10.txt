Oh, that's such a beautiful musical. There is a bit of abuse - Frank Sinatra, like the Jewish Nathan Detroit, is a serious abuse, although it only becomes clear in "Sue Me," a decidedly Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs in the series "Marry the Man Today" and replace it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece. Considering these two shortcomings, the movie is otherwise great. Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing beans, but he brings it out anyway. Stubby Kaye wonderfully repeats his Broadway role (she was written for him). Damon Runyon's language, pace and humor come into their own. This is on my See-It-Every-Chance-I-Get-List.
