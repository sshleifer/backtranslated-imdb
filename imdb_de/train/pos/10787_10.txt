When I was little, I got this movie and my sister and I loved it. We would see it all the time. When our friends came over, we had nights and we looked at the big Rock Candy Mountain and Grandpa's magical toys. I'm 21 years old now and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently got together and watched the movie. We knew all the songs and danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. A friend bought this movie and grandpa's magic toys for her two-year-old daughter because she wants to share our love for the movie. This is a movie where your kids can watch and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, just a lot of great songs and important lessons.
