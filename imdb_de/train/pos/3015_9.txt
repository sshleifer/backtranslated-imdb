Why can not this compact, entertaining secret be turned in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing the whole way. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell shows true star quality. Who knows - maybe he rehearsed for his future as Nick Charles. It is a pleasure to see. You can also see why Eugene Pallette has made more than 200 films. He is a great supporting actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun. Mary Astor does above average work in a not very fleshy role. All other hands are used to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball that judged his. Bravo!
