A very grim, brave account of part of the history of World War II that most of us in the US had no idea. I would like to have that on video. It was only shown on t.v. as far as I know, once in '89 or '90. I asked about this movie, and most video stores do not know about it. Great actresses, wish I could see it again. First class series.
