It's sad to see this movie now, because we know how the ANC was influenced by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing much. Forest has achieved little. Yes, apartheid was completely abolished, but the entire power apparatus was reserved by the whites of the minority, which more or less rendered the ANC government powerless. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, the deKlerk government had a twofold strategy in the talks between black and white leaders. First, the emerging Washington consensus has been drawn that there is no single way to run an economy of economic decision-making - such as trade policy and the central bank - as "technical" or "managerial". It then used a variety of new political instruments - international trade agreements, constitutional innovations and structural adjustment programs - to transfer control of these power centers to allegedly impartial experts, economists and officials of the IMF, the World Bank, GATT and the National Party - except the liberation fighters of the ANC. "The statistical results are frightening, no major changes have been made, and AIDS is flourishing." The cry of freedom in this light is profoundly ironic-indeed, tragic-the ANC has turned from the solution to the primary problem.
