This movie is one of my favorite foreign films, some of which are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with these films, as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes an earthly piece of life and turns it into a profound, heartfelt lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his earthly life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. The moment he needs his train, he is fascinated by her. But is it only their beauty, their distant gaze, or a connection that both will discover that they share? <br /> <br /> Let's dance has unforgettable, wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. They break up traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, risking everything for happiness and finding that the joy is not too far. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and in itself exceeds the ordinary by showing the true magic and wonder that life can be.
