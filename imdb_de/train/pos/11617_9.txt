The premise is simple. This movie looks like an average lame chick movie about two attractive young people meeting in an airport, then things take a 180-degree turn ... I really do not mind the kind mind numbed love story nonsense of the average movie theater dirty. And it's my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror movies (Sceam), does the same ... Following this logic, it's not surprising that Craven takes sardonic time to build a disgustingly sweet 'sependipity love' just to have a great Cillian Murphy wreck in the whole sugar-filled dream world ... It's lame, right?) In this movie it's impressive, he becomes extremely charming to a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book is. As he continues to freak out his victim (Jennifer Garner, much like Rachel McAdams, whom I found quite annoying, by the way), you can not help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven , embodied in Jackson Ripner, by Cillian Murphy, who flies all mindless chicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, Greetings. <br /> <br /> Best quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after punching Rachel McAdams in the plane toilet): "Thanks for the quickie !!!"
