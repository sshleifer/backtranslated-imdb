This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. My parents are from rural India and I have seen to some extent the life of the villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie reflects exactly the same. Full recognition for the director and the actor. You did an excellent job. I'm just wondering how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not for Doghi. I do not understand the criteria by which the films are selected. If the money that makes the difference or has some big names in the movie makes the difference.
