Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital following a suicide attempt. He visits her where he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), the girlfriend of Simone. He and Stella get very close later Simone dies. According to Trelkovsky, the landlord thinks and the neighbors are trying to turn him into Simone, so that he could finally jump out the window. Le Locataire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film of Polanski's apartment trilogy. The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski does not only do a good job as a director, but also as an actor. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. The landlord, Monsieur Zy, is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. The tenant is scary from time to time. He gives a lot of psychological anxiety. This movie is not the simplest, it understands or explains it all so fascinating.
