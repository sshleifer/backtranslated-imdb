I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in one moment of the movie we want them to die for each other. Their story is what we've ever wanted and most of us have probably never met. This is about love, but not about stupid things like "Notting Hills" or such movies. That's the life and I believed in them, I thought they would fall ... That was so smart and touching. I just finished a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see you again as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I now became a misanthrope and felt that love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie, I realized that this was somewhere and someday something could happen really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and I did not know Juli Delpy very well despite Kieslowski's "Three Colors: White" ... Now I have to see her work differently because she looks like an angel and has a perfect acting. <br /> <br /> I saw "Before Sunset" (the sequel in Paris) a few days before I saw "Before Sunrise" and it does not matter. They are both masterpieces. Prove that you do not have to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English, which I try best. Franck in France
