I did not expect "Girlfight" to be a strong filmmaking experience. It is an indie. Low budget, no big actor, freshman director. I had heard that it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, housed in a modern, ethnic Brooklyn working-class, has done an extraordinary job of coping with everyday struggles in urban life. Latinos Diana, the protagonist, is furious and beats her head High school colleagues having problems with the school and their friends. She is raised by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based dual standard to his children. The father's double standard is exemplified by the fact that Tiny, the brother, takes boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar activities. Diana is fascinated with boxing on a job to meet with Tiny in the gym. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana swap places; He gets the money from dad and gives it to Diana, so he can prove the lessons in his place. <br /> <br /> This is actually a feel-good movie as Diana grows and learns by boxing, meets a man, and addresses some very serious issues. There is no mystery: "Everything that can go well is right", resolution "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and the associated personal problems are too big for a Pat Resolution, but "Girlfight" is in my opinion a better and more satisfying film for it.
