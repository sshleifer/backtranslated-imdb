"I just wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain." This is an excellent movie. It should have been changed to PG-13. But definitely, Prince's first movie and the biggest. The follow-up was bad. But I have not seen in years, so I can remember that. The Kid (Prince) must, with the victory over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), the band together (The Revolution as herself) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (Time Herself) ruins his life. Just as Morris (himself) tries to steal The Kid Apollonia. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you love it, buy it.
