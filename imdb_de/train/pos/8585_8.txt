Captivating story of captured US coat, who must prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ryker evades friendly fire in a seemingly damned attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the sense of classic court dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-made mystery, skillfully led by a stellar cast, director Kulik's constant momentum and striking twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Originally filmed as a television movie in 1964, this film was later expanded with the presence of many "name" actors and action sequences. Dillman, who replays his role, is the dubious defender whose attention sometimes diverges from the personal plight of Ryker's supportive but somewhat distant wife, who is played with flying colors by Vera Miles. Rounding out the front with Peter Graves for the prosecutor and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in important supporting roles. Marvin's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a well-balanced representation of a simple but devoted man who is usually at home. Restraint is called into question by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin changes perfectly from resigned indifference to passionate determination and delivers a compelling, often intense performance that is the culmination of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this performance that should make the film a platform on which it occupies a place on the best lists of drama in the courtroom. Despite its apparent darkness, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains a tense captivating exam, like a book you just can not take off. Highly recommended.
