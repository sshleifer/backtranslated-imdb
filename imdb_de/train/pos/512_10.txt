"Stairway to Heaven" is an outstanding invention of filmmaking that has probably never been duplicated. I rank it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen," though it's a completely different kind of movie than "African Queen." "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that are, to my knowledge, absolutely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is the combination of black-and-white and color footage - as in "Oz," but the importance of contrast goes far beyond the simple yet beautiful effect of "Oz." In "Stairway" the purpose and the effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful. <br/> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Stairway" is the term "time" and how it is used here. How could anyone imagine a better way to stand still? literally? And then there is the staircase itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any ideas, you will agree. "Stairway to Heaven" is a true gem.
