Norman, is that you? was (this is all from a third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) for an African-American family from a Jewish family, as she made the transition from the stage to the screen. It was also one of those films that were originally shot in videos, so the prints from the theater could not have been that great. The appearances of Redd Foxx and others, however, were pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIODIC PIECE: It reflected the mid-to-early 70s attitude of finding out if you have a gay son or a gay daughter in your family. That's why it's pretty interesting - if not a bit "Hollywood". Do not believe me Look at the lines on curtains and so on. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie really shines in some areas. There is a side-splitting scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who escaped to Ensenada with his brother (!) In a souped-up pinto. The telephone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did his gay routine, which he practiced in gay bars and nightclubs. To my knowledge, this was filmed for the first time. And it's a tidier and much shorter version. Nevertheless, it is Vintage Madame and should not be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; The man was really talented. Enjoy the movie!
