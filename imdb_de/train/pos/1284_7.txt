I've watched The Babysitter on DVD as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive-in Cult Classics (with releases by Crown International Pictures). I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie brings a lot of history in a very short time. They have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexuality, blackmail and murder in one place! <br /> <br /> The leading actors do a credible job. I found the lavishly woven story believable and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the supportive cast, primarily the bikers, provides a stilted performance, especially when asked to deliver lines in more than a few words. Maybe they used real bikers instead of actors. Especially a few characters were exceptionally credible. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely accurate, for the times, the pace and the evolution of the story. I found the music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie contained the music from "The Food". I googled her; but could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and played in this film, found the idea so great (by a wayward married man brought to salvation ) Trials and tribulations and a little help (of course) that he wrote, produced and played in "Weekend with the Babysitter".
