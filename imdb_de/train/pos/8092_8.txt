I came across this movie as a 8-10 year old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I played outside all day and froze, and when I came in around 4:00 pm I took a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not all happy and stupid - and indeed was dark and moralistic. It excited my imagination. I'm sure the text is missing and abbreviated in the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice of bearing a burden on the welfare of others, the consequences of selfish decisions, hasty decisions, etc. But the only place where this film stands out clearly about the new films , are the language characterizations. John Hurt is great. If you do not like how the character is painted, look away and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I have seen it many, many times and it always brings me back as a child to this time of thirsting for magical adventures. For this reason, I say "luck", the film is nostalgic for me, so I can overlook the shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's imagination it still reached me and still does.
