We start all reviews with the following information. My wife and I have watched nearly 100 movies a year for the last 15 years. We have recently been honored that we have been able to get lifetime movie tickets at no cost! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS counts for NULL. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert really do not differ from you or me. The only difference is that they can write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of films, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we believe that it is good enough if you enjoy your money for two hours! We never listen and read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as we do. Good enough about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good but very good. The critics are a bunch of idiots. Just because there is nudity and language, they hated it. It was worth the price of a ticket and that's all you can ask for. Is not that right? Not every film can be a candidate for an Academy Award. Sharon Stone is great and does a great job in the movie and it puzzles me what the critics in hell want
