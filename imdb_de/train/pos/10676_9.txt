Filmed on location in Gerard Gardens, Liverpool, this film was Britain's response to films such as Blackboard Jungle. The movie has passed the time well and all moral stories are (still) relevant.

Baker plays a Liverpool cop who handles juvenile liaison on the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age, they'll end up as responsible adults. Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real brother and sister) involved in a fire of arsonists. Tsai Chin still acts as an actor and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman movie "The Interpretor". Violent Playground offers a siege in a school. It is therefore unlikely that he will be shown on television after similar events Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the movie was made (though he was not born then), and have fond memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens, which features excerpts from Violent Playground, and a small British film, Coast to Coast with Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The apartments were demolished in 1987, and the films help keep the memory alive. <br /> <br /> When the film was released, there were some complaints from the residents, as the film was in a bad light. Time has helped to heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie, I would recommend that you find out
