Blade Runner (Deckard is a replica!), <br /> <br /> City of Lost Children (intensified senses or whatever is needed and abused and mostly good, just gives us less than we could dream of) and < br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> These should really be added. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for some time for an animated movie that could impact me as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first one. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you do not go, it must be love most of the time, right? But there are so many science fiction and noir themes that are completely lost in this film that it's just a miracle to watch them. <br /> <br /> These people have done an incredible job!
