This movie is not porn, it should not be porn, and if my uncle does not run for the president of the world, he should never be considered porn. Now that the topic has been clarified, I can say I recommend this film extensively, as the issues are still widespread. It's funny, the acting is great and raises serious (curious) questions. <br /> <br /> I can not fully understand why this movie was so abused. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern Riot Grrrl movement. Confusion, curiosity and joke are her main attributes. She is occasionally angry, but are not we all?
