I found this movie pretty good. Some parts were hackneyed, but that's understandable since it was made more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the movie was given by Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If you fancy a silly, outstanding musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
