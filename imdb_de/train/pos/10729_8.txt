Some summer space campers were inadvertently sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was scarce. They had to send someone to a space station to get the fuel tanks and so on. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But there is a warm feeling of everything possible when you use your heart. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see these young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was shot in 1986.) There are some people in this film who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was great space. It does not look unreal. It's about 2 hours long and runs so fast that you do not even notice. You know it's not real, but you're only drawn in to the end. Overall, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
