"FULL HOUSE" is in my opinion an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've never seen every episode, but I enjoyed it anyway. One of my favorite episodes is the wedding of Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin). If you want to know how the whole thing was so funny, you must have seen it yourself. It was a two-parter, so you would have seen both parts. Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) include a gas station at Michelle's birthday. You would have to have seen it yourself, if you want to know how and why that happened. I have many others that I like too. Everyone has always done well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In summary, syntax is synonymous, but I strongly recommend catching it, just in case it's out of the air forever.
