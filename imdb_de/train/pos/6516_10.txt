Hello. I saw this movie for the 14th time in 3 days today. I am a history teacher who has too much time in my hands. I need a life. I found the movie with a striking resemblance to the ridge. I also thought that I would look very much like Jean Lafitte if he were white. My favorite line in the entire movie was Mr. Petey - "This baby can shoot a chipmunk eye from 300 meters away !!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came in and the only drummer so dedicated to his work, and he drummed to the death, as if that drum was ending the war ... it would not be Well, that is everything I want to say about this movie. Oh, one more thing ... Bonnie Brown is an insane physco-bipolar mood that vibrates BEEYOTCH. that's all.
