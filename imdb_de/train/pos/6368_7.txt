While there are no talking animals, big lavish song production numbers or breeders with half white / half black hair ... there is only one thing ... realistic people who usually behave in a weird case, and Walt & Roy did their era with the studio. If you think that "The Castaways" or "The Island At The Top Of The World" are not identical or you accuse them of a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as crazy as your kids watch a friggin 'cartoon until midnight.
