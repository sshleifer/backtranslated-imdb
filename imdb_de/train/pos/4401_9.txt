Ride With The Devil by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another gem in this fine director's cap. For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas Missouri border wars in the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. Plus some great action scenes (sometimes pretty bloody). This is a story of love and devotion between men and especially a lady. It's Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and as a young lady Jewel I've never seen or seen her, I want to see more of her.) Roman) <br /> <br /> This is a long movie of 128 minutes, but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> or submitted <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
