This is an "Odysessy Through Time" through computer animation, supposedly the work of over 300 artists. Made in the late '80s and launched in 1990, this was groundbreaking for the day. I found it good and pretty interesting in places. <br /> <br /> Most short scenes did not make sense, just shapes that turned into other shapes, but it was fun to watch them. This is about visuals, not some kind of story. There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking people hung around with birds. Everything is computer-animated, which was new at the time. Even the term "computer animated" was not widely known. <br /> <br /> It's just a chance to showcase this new technology in short, cartoon-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners must have loved that. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, intriguing 40-minute "eye candy" and "headdress". Although today's CG effects have lost their effect, I think they are still entertained.
