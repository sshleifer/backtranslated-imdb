Paul Verhoeven (genius and filmmaker) strikes back with the less perfect, yet fun in a "dirty old man's way," Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the Slasher final act is disappointed. Still, I recommend this movie for its MIND BLOWING special effects (perhaps the best so far) and two dandy performances by Leads. Of course, Verhoeven's moral issues are a source of food for thought, and though the film has rejected many, this film is rather soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two main flaws: Josh Brolin (aka Walking Ape-Man) and the whole deal with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they locked up in the lab? <br /> <br /> A funny horror movie for a Saturday night.
