Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After finding out that her dead aunt has left her stuff, Elvira goes to England to pick it up and hopes it's some money. To her horror, Elvira learns that everything her aunt leaves her is her house, her dog, and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle down anyway, but with her striking dark looks and stunning features, she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning against the whole city, and with Elvira's outrageous attitude and looks, everyone is looking out for it, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to bring Elvira into all those adventures, it's just great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, sure, it's stupid and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to look at it. I would give Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, 8/10
