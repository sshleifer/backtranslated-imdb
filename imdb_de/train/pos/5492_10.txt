I've been impressed by Chavez's stance against globalization for some time, but it was not until I saw the film at the Amsterdam Documentary Film Festival that I realized what he really achieved. This film tells the story of a coup / conspiracy by the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and corpulent Western governments that are removing Democratically elected President Chavez and returning Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson to the rest of the world! I recommend to people in Venezuela that they have taken matters into their own hands and saved their country from people like Halliburton and the Bush regime.
