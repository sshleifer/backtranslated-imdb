`Bruce Almighty 'will win the Oscars with 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass "Titanic" as the highest grossing movie of all time! Jim Carrey's fame will be so high that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandiose fantasies would manifest only if the filmmakers (including Carrey) had the power of God. The same premise is the most important ingredient in Carrey's new uprising "Bruce Almighty." Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter so obsessed with being the main anchor that he totally blames God for his own acquaintances. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the "gift of God" (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's job even better. Obviously, Bruce is swept away with his newly discovered, blissful abilities and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual all-powerful comedic form in "Bruce Almighty". Jennifer Aniston was not as uncomfortable as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my best kudos go to director Tom Shadyac because he did not let the dog out of the house for # 2 and show us the hilarious bathroom scene of all time! "Bruce Almighty" is not the most profound Carrey movie, but it's still a tickling show of "Carreyism"! **** Well
