VIVAH is THE BEST MOVIE FROM 2006 in my book! PERIOD !!. In my book it is one of the best 100 films ever made in Bollywood. It is sad that this movie does not have so many reviews and is not that popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is again a real accomplishment by a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya, Sooraj has once again taken a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> These are the simplest and cutest movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP, and later Dhoom 2, who even defeated Don in this regard, I finally see a movie so close to my heart and culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and making Hollywood crash movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and very much related to the Indian system of arranged marriage, which I would like to be involved in as well. Our system, which teaches us to obey elders, follow them and of course obey their minds, is shown so brilliantly in this film! Of course, there is no power in choosing your life partner, and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and their determination to decide, as shown brilliantly in this film. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a journey between the beautiful time of the engagement and the marriage. The stage in which the guy meets the girl! Both understand each other ... Both try to judge whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and what different factors occur during marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like the HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HORSES REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, a must see for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition and I do definitely! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
