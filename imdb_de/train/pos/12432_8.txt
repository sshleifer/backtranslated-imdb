I expected this to be the same kind of punch as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I have not watched it for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a consequence of stupid gun battles and car / boat chases - it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets as hard as nails, with nothing overrated or streamlined though helped The limitations really were: Less time and effort was spent to find more and more stupid ways for stunt men who pretended to die, and more emphasis was placed on making the movie worth seeing. Damn, the biggest cannon fight takes place off-screen - and the scene you hear it is all the better for the background noise that increases the tension - who wins? Who dies? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as gorgeous as Monica Vitti, but there are only a few, and she certainly has everything she needs to make the character run her face, her hair and her big one , slim body could have been removed directly from the comic book graphics. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise villain that he made the character interesting and enjoyable - even sympathetic (and I doubt that I would consider many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). I can not imagine a single one of Hollywood's "former waiters" who could have saved the role so well. Fortunately, Blaise bad guys always end up dying (no spoilers there!) a really good thing, because all the girls who spent their time swarming over such a disgustingly pretty and interesting guy, can now decide pragmatically for us ordinary joes.
