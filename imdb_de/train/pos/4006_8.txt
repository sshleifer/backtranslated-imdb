[WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have a grown-up boyfriend for whom the idea of ​​her parents having sex makes her terribly restless. It came to my mind as I reflected on the audience's reaction to "The Mother." <br /> <br /> People gasped as May (Anne Reid) passionately wriggled in bed with her younger guy-lover Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings of May. I doubt the audience was appalled by the nudity or content of the drawings, and also felt uncomfortable seeing a woman in her 60s who enjoyed sex. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Son the Fanatic") once again proves why he is one of the sharpest narrators on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to grasp. This seething family drama is not a film that you can claim to have liked to see because it is raw and complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. Still, it's a very good stuff. Kureishi and Roger Michell (who led "Notting Hill", of course) make an unsentimental, considerate and highly effective portrait of an elderly woman who finally notices them. In those years she can and should enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderful epiphany moment, when her son Bobby asks her not to be difficult, May shoots back, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not really. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her round as of May. It is subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Watch Reid as May watches Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate pub in a pub. Or if she asks Paula to open the front door after a catastrophic date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all the fears and despair of May. In the most devastating moment of the movie, May falls to his knees in front of Darren, ready to do anything for him, and only asks him to be friendly. This is an incredibly brave performance by a notable actress. <br /> <br /> Michell really enjoyed the use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots arrive at Bobby. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony of May and Toots, the naughty way in which her own family welcomes her. This movie sometimes reminded me of the honesty and rudeness of Mike Leigh's work, with the exception of "The Mother" holding on to a slight optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My only criticism: Michelle's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers are out of focus, while in the foreground a white curtain gently flutters in the wind. And the only sound from May is in the throats of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely surround Darren's role, are so intimately involved in these roles. It's unfair, the almost primitive energy of their characters in front of the audience to hide. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral. <br /> <br /> This movie has no likable characters. We understand May, but she too causes her daughter to suffer. But I doubt that Kureishi intended to populate his story with sympathetic people. I think it was his goal to unmask a family that is already breaking when something catastrophic happens. It is undaunted in its openness and ultimately memorable.
