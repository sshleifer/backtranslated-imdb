I love bad movies. Not only because they "really" "good" films are often as entertaining as (like Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are often far better than those movies. And that's why I love the Italian rip-off cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has made some really great movies, like House on the edge of the park and also his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop are Like a Man entertaining action movies. That is really bad. The barbarians are so idiotic film. Peter and David Paul as the barbarians brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, because they lack charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, shout and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, the people who hang the Barbarian Brothers try and escape an extraordinary way. <br/> <br /> bad acting, bad special effects, very silly story, bad direction in this film everything is really bad. I can not describe how much I laughed when I saw the first time. The barbarians and the company is a camp classic everyone should see. If you think Plan 9 from space is a fun camp, this will be a real killer.
