This movie is good. It's not the best of the big CG Kung Fu movies, but it's pretty good. At first the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​gods against fallen gods dealing with superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is too many characters! It got very confusing when they changed the scenes! The special effects were AMAZING! The fight scenes were very fast and complex. This movie is virtually computer generated. The spectacle is outstanding, as always expected from such high-profile players. Ekin Cheng is an outstanding protagonist and loner. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. I thought she would play a bigger role, but she did a fight scene and a lot of yapping. The villain, the whole skull army, and the whole blood cloud thing is very scary. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just a movie. There is too much history to stuff in 2 hours. If there is a book or something, maybe I could keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story for action. I recommend Storm Riders every day.
