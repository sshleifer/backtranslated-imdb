I think many people have just written this as another movie by Tom Cruise (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely a movie of its own. Many people said it was funny; it was not so It was different and confusing, but not funny. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. The Truman Show is different. Confusing is the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not right away, maybe not today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That is the point. Here the so-called "weirdness" came into play, which rejected the critics. If they had bothered to "open their eyes" to their original Spanish film of 1997, they would have seen it. And if that's not reason enough to see it, look at the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack. he uses it to set the "feeling" - the infamous element that many films lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" playing at the film's dramatic and emotional climax, it creates an unusual, but amazingly "right" feel. Vanilla Sky is a wonderful movie that is sad in its script, music, acting and imagery. A superficial film criticized by critics to be intelligent. Excellent: A +
