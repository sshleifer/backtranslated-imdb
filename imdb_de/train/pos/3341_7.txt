I saw this movie on Thursdays after a really boring day. I had no expectations, they were rather negative. The only movie I ever saw Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?). Do not ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always cute, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet such a sweet nerd? :) Movies like these are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sundays Thursdays I'm not even a sports fanatic, but I'm fascinated with American baseball movies. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
