Although the "special effects" and technical features of this film may indeed be ridiculous to some, I have never been able to erase the images that this film has left on my young and impressive mind when I first saw him in the film Age of about 8 years saw. The story of this girl's survival and the trials he's been through have stayed with me all these years, and I've thought more than once how the girl has come out of situations far beyond what I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was just a kid when I saw for the first time that that is the reason for my high rating of this film. Every time this movie was televised in the 70s and 80s, I was tied to the TV and drank in every scene with an interest that I can not explain. I think seeing the first time as an adult (and with a view of the world) may not be so enjoyable for some. I really tried to get a copy to show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with remarkable human survival stories, partial to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, you would probably enjoy this movie as much as I have enjoyed it for 30 years.
