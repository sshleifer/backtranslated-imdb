I saw this movie in anticipation of what I got: good science fiction cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a great job with a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine, you are trying to act under these two limitations: you have barely any dialogue and because you have a tough head military robot, you must not show emotions with facial expressions! Howzat Ask a bit of a diva to play a great aria when gagged and glued. Although he is verbally and expressively handcuffed, Russell has an incredible character. His robot becomes human despite the limitations. Great work! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason assures Isaacs that he will go down in history as the great doorman of the accomplished villain - the one you would like to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and beautiful. I am not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take her eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the action is fairly normal, with a number of weaknesses, but since it gives a sci-fi comic feel, I do not see what's wrong with a few flaws. At the end of the story, the good wins, and the appreciative audience experiences great emotional contentment. Yes! <br /> <br /> The enemy who thinks that Russell did not do well in acting is the same enemy who missed the whole point.
