I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the reviews were bad, but most critics say a movie should be like a drama of ideas. This movie has a bit of drama, but the rest is fun and entertaining. Forget that Julia Roberts is a pretty woman. Emma Roberts is a pretty young lady and there is more to her. Emma was so much fun in the role of Nancy Drew. It's nice to see a new face. I think she will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on the books, but the story is still good. There's also a good mix of other character actors and supportive actors like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan. I'm surprised that Disney did not release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it contains neither sex nor violence and curses. This is a good family movie that is rare these days. Take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good he is. I can not wait for the sequel.
