Rated E (Contains violence). <br /> <br /> I had the original Spiderman game for PC for a few years. I still have not hit it, as there is an error on one level under Windows XP Can not beat because of it. So be forewarned if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try this game. It's a clean family game with action and it's great for any Spiderman fanatic. In the game you play Spiderman and you meet several criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any Spiderman fan or parent wishing a fun, clean game for his kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
