Why did it sound like her husband called her Appy? It ruined a great episode so I can only give it a 6. The right grammar and pronunciation are essential for a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very bright, what with all the skin tears, although I do not know how anyone can survive Without skin, the skin is a vital organ for the body, the largest organ without which we would die. The more a horror movie is true, the scary it can be and more entertaining. <br /> <br /> But I admit that the stories of the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 Come on Yankies bring your English on par!
