This is a great Sammo Hung movie. Actually, this is a great piece of action cinema in Hong Kong. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macau who seek love and mingle with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all sympathetic and clearly defined. The story includes and has enough romance, drama, comedy and suspense to watch between the fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves that he is probably the best fight choreographer in the industry. The action is just incredible, especially. the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are incredible. A must for every action fan.
