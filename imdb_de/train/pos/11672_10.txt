Excellent pirate entertainment! It has all the ingredients to attract attention - an enthralling story about intrigue, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who attracts the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn), who takes on one secret mission is on his own. They make a fine romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the mean, evil pirate who spins his rogue web of separation and conquest. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick, who played a supportive role as Mrs. MacGregor, protector of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful filmed scene of shorelines, ships and the bay. Lots of action including sword fighting, ship battles, daring jumps by Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard ships!). From the flaming redhead himself, I once heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara that she had great powers over the bullwhip and that Flynn could outdo her in the sword fight, but there was no need to put it to the test here. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable movie.
