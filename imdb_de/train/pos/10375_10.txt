A Country Boy Aussie Rules player (Mat) heads to town the night before an important AFL friendly, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong. <br /> <br /> His no-hoper cousin has been involved in a drug deal involving local loan shark / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like every gangster, but definitely Australian). It is needless to say that Mat is involved in the chaos, and it will not be long before the thoughts of tomorrow's game are pushed into the back of his head as the desperate events of the night unfold. <br /> <br /> Western Australian pro Shakespearean Actor Toby Malone performs well as a young, naive country-boy mat and plays a role well below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny and an entertaining role from David Ngoombujarra as one of the policemen after the events. The roles are fast, often funny and one hour very rewarding.
