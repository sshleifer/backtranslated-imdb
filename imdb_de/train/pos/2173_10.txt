Often we can only look back years later and see the stars that are really stars. The French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "There is no garbo, there is no lockpick, there is only Louise Brooks." and thank you, heaven! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it's also an extraordinary movie because it's one, if not the first, French talkie, followed by a screenplay by the famous Ren√© Clair, supposedly completed by Georg Pabst (the director) and the voice of Edith Piaf before she was known ! So much talent working on and in a movie, how could it not prove to be a masterpiece ?! And that is exactly this movie. It's a shame that Louise Brooks was overshadowed by Hollywood when she returned to the US - so many talents who have so arrogantly fallen by the wayside! In the movie you can not only see Louise Brooks in action, but also see pictures of Paris. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice. I never get tired of this movie!
