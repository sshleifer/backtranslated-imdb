I just thought it was excellent and I still do it. I am grateful that we can still see other things than what Hollywood almost flooded us with. Saving Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel better offended by the marijuana thing look at the nature of the American bride. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie does not have to be stupid. I laughed at the whole ass, but I also thought about what the female protagonist should be to pay her deceased husband's debts. <br /> <br /> In short - a funny story with typical English humor and good acting and directing. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
