As I read a variety of "scoop" reviews in recent days, I went to the theater to prepare for an entertaining excursion from Woody. Fortunately, I could not have been more wrong. Granted, actor Woody slows down one or two touches, but writer / director Woody is in good shape - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old self into the story. Judging by laughter and laughter, the audience ate Allens one-liners and dialogue in a way that I have not seen in years. <br /> <br /> In a film landscape dominated by software-authored story arcs, twenty different flavors, and production-line formulas for children, it's a source of satisfaction and inspiration as Allen pursues his highly personal yet rewarding pursuit Path.
