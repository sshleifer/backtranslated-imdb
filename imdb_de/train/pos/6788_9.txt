The story and the characters were some of the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for the PS and the cut scenes and voice overs were unbelievable. I have defeated the game at least three times and loved every second of it. I found the issues confronting the protagonist believable and realistic, and I believe he deserves a sequel. or at least a remake. If they would redo it for the PS3, I would buy the system only for this game, and maybe it's amazing that the idea and execution of the Dragoon system is sufficient to justify a rent wand-master combat add-on system and the storyline will do this Play for a definite purchase.
