Since last September, I have borrowed four to six weekly movies from the Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive DVD collection. (The HWL is truly a circulating library: three-quarters of its films are available at any time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find the short films by David Lynch. Yesterday, when I did not know much about the animated series, I found Dumbland. I'm here to report that the eight episodes for David Lynch fans are well spent half an hour. <br /> <br /> The most notable feature of these short pieces are their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive system provide drums. Outrageous voices emphasize the breaks. Physical violence delivers the beats. Twittering birds and buzzing sockets roam along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The tempo of the rough animation is often the same as the sound, but the soundtrack itself was Lynch's primary interest in creating and distributing this work. In a sense, these eight shorts are unique Lynch rhythms. <br /> <br /> That is, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, stupid and funny as hell. And there is enough room to think about how absurd we humans can be. I can not say I'll go back to the collection, but for those who enjoy the movements of the Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
