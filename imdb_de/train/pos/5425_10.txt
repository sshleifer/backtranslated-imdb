This, and not a somewhat overrated Southern Soap Opera in 1939, was the biggest epic coming out of Hollywood's biggest year. I'll be the obvious Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer), and Douglas Fairbanks do not repeat Jr. giving outstanding comic book performances. However, I would like to mention two more less understandable elements of this masterpiece. The grandiose final battle sequence, while the wonderful Sam Jaffe laboriously climbs to the top of the temple to blow his trumpet and warn the regiment, is simply terrific. It fascinates me again and again. Another undervalued element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as a guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya, he has defeated the armies remaining in India of Alexander the Great"). In fact, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the thirties (A German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi field? Not quite. Nevertheless a huge, funny, moving epic.
