I found the one and only commentary to this film completely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I decided to write my own. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and have been catching it a few times since then. Let me first say that the movie as a whole is doing RIGHT, which is worth it. It does not matter that there are some problems with the budget and other mistakes. It is worth seeing. The idea of ​​making a film based on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, close-knit Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant scene. The film is about the kind of humanizing catalysis that inspired Whitman in humans. And in that sense, it's just right. Acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The scripting and the dialogue are strong and take into account the customs and phrases of the time. What is not to like in total? Do you also name another film that brings Whitman to life so alive?
