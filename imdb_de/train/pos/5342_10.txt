This movie has moved me in many ways. First, let me just say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! Such a pretty little girl. Her acting was also excellent. Lifelike and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was just a fake prop. In any case, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I'm immersed in the story and its character. <br /> <br /> It's pretty interesting how I actually discovered this movie. I was in the blockbuster and happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as I passed by. Fortunately, I took a look in the direction of this movie! I thought to myself, 'Awe, look at her!' I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as "A Little Gem". I read the plot on the back and then thought, well, maybe I'll check the IMDb and come back later. I am glad that I did not do it, because I certainly would not have made it. After looking for a movie with my friend, I knew I would regret not having rented this movie. I went back to where I originally found him and grabbed him. <br /> <br /> It had it I was on my dresser for a week since school started for this week and I really did not have time to look at it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I put it in and was connected from beginning to end with the beautiful camera, the sexy result and the moving action. I was so fascinated and have to say, some parts have almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to mention the boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was remarkable. Even the actor who played Carol's father is unfortunately not listed on the website. His voice was so gentle and gentle that I really could feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is really a wonderful movie. If you are a person moved by light but emotional films, then this is definitely one for you.
