Having recently seen "Whipped" at a AFM distributor's show, I have to say that I was very impressed. The audience laughed all the way. Unfortunately, every territory has already been sold, so I did not have a chance to buy the film, but I am firmly convinced that it will be a great success both domestically and at sea. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be called a male "Sex and the City" because "Whipped" is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously, as opposed to "Sex and the City". "Whipped" is fun in relationships, in a way that most sex comedies would not dare. The film I screened at the AFM had more plot and story than "Swingers," "Clerks," and "Sex and the City." "Whipped" never slowed down for a beat and gave the audience uninterrupted comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all absolutely solid, which only made the movie more impressive given the budget.
