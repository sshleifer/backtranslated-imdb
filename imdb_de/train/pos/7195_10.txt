I loved this exciting Republic series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! The picture quality was not very good, but okay. Fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should have just practiced a little more. As I said, the story is great! They just sit and wait to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who did the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, which was the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and the legionnaires too! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love that Reed plays Hadley Zorro! He is funny, smart and brave! Note: 6.
