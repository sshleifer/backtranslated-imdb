This movie is just great. It was a very sensitive topic and the movie was outstanding. This film has not caused any controversy in India and its reputation has also been kept low. At first, I thought this movie would be a waste of time, as most Indian directors and producers have changed the subject, though it is very sensitive and adds a love story in the original story and spoils the whole thing remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, and so on. <br /> <br /> There were so many movies in India that would have become milestones or mega hits if the love story part were not added unnecessarily. <br /> <But his treatment is quite similar to the Pinjar movie (also a must). <br /> <br /> When it comes down to it, I'd like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a great movie.
