A matter of life and death, what can you really say to do justice to the genius and beauty of this movie? The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no bounds, each frame is filled with fantastically courageous compositions. Switching between the bold colors of "the real world" and the strong black and white of the sky is awesome and visually shows us how much more alive life is. The final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and the jury go down the stairs to heaven to hold the operation on Peter (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All performances are just right (Roger Livesey is a standout) and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful. Never before has there been a more romantic film than this (if it's there I did not see it.) In a matter of life and death, it's all about the power of love and how important life is, and Jack Cardiff's film is cause Enough to watch the movie alone, the way he illuminates Kim JÃ¤ger's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make simple things like a table tennis game look exciting, and the sound design is impeccable and how the sound is muted at key points was a decision that was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore everyone's confidence in the cinema from all my time favorites That's why I'm giving this movie a 10/10 in a word - Fine.
