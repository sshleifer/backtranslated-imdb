An end to an era was released here in the US in spring 2002 with "The Rookie," a Disney live action movie that "The Best of the End !!!!" It took place right here in Texas! Actually, the story began in West Texas, as a code shows on a local sign. It was about a high school coach who was so convinced of his high-class baseball team that he decided to become a professional. !! It was a very good sports movie, including "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. It also had moviegoers through Texas, from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can tell because I recognize this ballpark (It was "The Ballpark in Arlington, now it's" Ameriquest Field "!) It was nice to see Disney's" Golden Age "ending up here in my area !!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and ended with baseball."
