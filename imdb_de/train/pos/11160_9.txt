This is really the biggest Swedish movie of all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narrative, it is also one of the first films to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of Sweden's most intelligent and witty filmmakers, and this film really shows that. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna Människor" (Adult People) is a warm-hearted and humorous man's adulthood story and the question of whether we would not be better off without her.
