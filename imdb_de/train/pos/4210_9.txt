I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were first-rate, including the most important thing, the script and acting. This is definitely one of the strongest roles of Richard Widmark. He convinces with his performance. Out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have tackled this role. This is my first encounter with Jean Peter's work that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely look for her other job. Thelma Ritter earned in an unglamorous role the Oscar nomination, which she received as an informant. This movie works on every level. The black and white photography is perfect and the story captivates the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Highly recommended, 9/10.
