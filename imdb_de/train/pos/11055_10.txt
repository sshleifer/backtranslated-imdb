Well, what can I say, unless these people are great in every way. I really like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure nostalgia series. And I have the set with 9 discs and 30 episodes in the box. I did not know that they had done so many anymore. I wish I had gotten these powers. Imagine I had fallen out of my circulation somewhere and got cold, then I wake up in a special hospital. Later, I find that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and excitement. You can not fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all types of weapons. The music is well written, and for me there is a wonderful picture of three super beings in my head. The powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dogs or cats. Improved vision, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy I totally had a crush on her !!!! Now I can see why on my DVD. The box is very nice and comes with a free booklet about the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, stuck, but he did things!
