I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years old and everyone loves the Doodlebops. The Doodlebops are energetic, lively and appealing. Once they start singing, we are the Doodlebops. We are the Doodlebops. We are the Doodlebops. Oh yeah Come on and join in the fun, because we laugh and we sing all day long. It's almost impossible not to join in The Doodlebops take the viewer into a world of colors and fun. Every show is an adventure, the Doodlebops are not trying to change the world through preaching messages. They only enjoy mastering the challenges of everyday life that appeals to the young child. The Doodlebops are a refreshing alternative to regular children's television programming.
