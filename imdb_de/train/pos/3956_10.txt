HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The new cooking scene of the movie at the beginning of the film is great. The stooges are always funny when they cook. After the first minutes of the cooking film, however, we cut the original material from BRIDELESS GROOM. During these remakes from 1953 to 1956, I noticed that they fit the new story. You make an insert shot if the old story does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I will not pass it on to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars.
