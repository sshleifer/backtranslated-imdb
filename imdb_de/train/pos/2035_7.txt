Well, I will go against the grain in this movie, it seems. As a self-confessed horror fan I sat down to it and did not quite know what to expect. After two or three minutes, I was actually scared (pretty rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is located near Charing Cross Station, but the lack of money in the films does not detract from the story. Yes, the story is a bit far-fetched and does not explain itself very well, but THE CREEP is a class act and continues to smash everything that gets in its way. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MOVIE YOU NEED TO CREATE YOUR EYES AT AT LEAST !! You will understand it when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie, and something changes to see a good Slasher movie that really scares you
