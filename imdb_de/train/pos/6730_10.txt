I've posted comments on IMDb, but I do not do that anymore. It happens that the IMDb has become massive and consequently subjectivity has ruined the score. What I mean? Anyone who is not particularly interested in movies and has no expertise on the subject is looking at crap (or the opposite), and if he likes, he will give you a 10, and if not, he will go for a 1. This can Of course, nothing is measured correctly. Now for the movie. I am very sorry that I have ever delivered a few 10er films, because then I have to score this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I will never see again in my life in any other movie. It's just mesmerizing and it's not just a way of saying; it's really. The last 25 minutes have a lot of energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the main characters - that really ... there is no possible game. I do not keep any movies, rarely would I have any sense in doing so, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and keep and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as the years go by. I do not have anything to say in addition. This is a real goal 10 for me.
