I'm from a completely different environment to Pinjar than most other reviewers who have posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood films and I was born and raised in the USA. So I have no broad base to compare Pinjar with other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands for nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line, I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important movies can come out of any studio at any time. On a mass battle scale, it could have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if properly promoted in the US. This could have been the movie that put Bollywood on the American map. The American film audience has a long-standing love affair with "Gone With the Wind," and although Pinjar does not lend to this conspiracy, there are some transient similarities. Last but not least, the (by American standards) whopping 183-minute runtime is not the least. <br /> <br /> Against the backdrop of the Indo-Pakistani division of 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young man's wife, who was held captive by the circumstances and was in trouble she could not manage. Put in an untenable position, it somehow manages not only to survive, but to grow - and even thrive. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing in any way, she is in the exhibition. The human growth of Puro (the protagonist) would be better illustrated, at least to Western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture, if the "back story" of their character was more fully developed at the beginning of the film. But that would have extended a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or maybe even more. Because not a minute of the movie is wasted and nothing that was cut from the cut could really be cut for time reasons. Better that the audience has to fill in something that came before than to leave out something that remains. <br /> <br /> I could describe Pinjar in many words: "poignant", "disturbing", "captivating" "heartbreaking" I immediately remember. But "uplifting" is perhaps as cheap as one of them. Any story showing the inflexibility of the human mind against the worst opportunities must be considered as such. And the triumph of Puro, while not immediately apparent to his surroundings, is nothing short of inspiring. For the strength of the story, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Also inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's depiction of Puro. Urmila is too often overlooked, as she is dominated by younger, newer actresses. It offers the unique ability to give an absolutely believable character in every role she plays. Not only does she play Puro's role, she breathes life into the character. Manoj Bajpai's selection as Rashid was inspired. He creates something that few Indian movie heroes can do: subtlety. His expression of expression and nuance is essential to the role. With his penetrating gaze, he brings more threat to the beginning of the film than any swordsman who pulls together. <br /> <br /> If you only see a Bollywood movie in your life, make him a Pinjar.
