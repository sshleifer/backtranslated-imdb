Although the story is basically routine and the end of the "surprise" is nothing short of a joke to the public, you can see what made these good actors attractive to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine they shine. The film is flawless - for its time. It was reworked as "Under Suspicion" in the year 2000 and if you want to see only one version of the story (that's all it deserves) I recommend the latter with the current direction of Hopkins and the more explicit references to plot points the original could only hint. The end, however, still strikes. (** 1/2)
