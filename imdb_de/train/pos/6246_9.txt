It's not an ingenious idea to watch dog days unless you're 100% aware of your mental stability, because it's rigorously tested with this movie, no matter how reasonable you are. I have to say that Dog Days is more of an art film than an entertainment movie, so the majority of viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to get on their sexy side. A bit like Tarkovsky films, but somehow different. I myself can not say that I had a lot of fun watching. But it is an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are tormented only by the clich√© of Hollywood. Hundstage puts a finger right in your brain and scratched you everywhere. You can not just sit back and watch, you use exclamations, or you look wide-eyed in the movie. A film that resembles this style in style is a night figure, but it was much better and less violent. For example, this is not for children or for people who are mentally gentle or in a bad mood. Most viewers would probably give this movie either a 10 or a 1. I'm giving a 9 because in another movie I saw the multi-story phenomenon in a movie, and it was better. But this is an outstanding piece in itself. Worth seeing, but get ready to see something disturbing.
