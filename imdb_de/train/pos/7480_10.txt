This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With his role as David Aames he captures the ideas of the audience. His character may in some way refer to us all. The story is very clever and keeps the audience on top during the entire movie. I've never seen Cruise movies that often, but once I've seen that, it shows me its true talent. My favorite piece in the movie is the end where everything comes to a big conclusion and he finds out the truth. If you have not seen this yet, you should definitely try it. It's one of those movies that you've only seen to the end once you've started watching, or you'll keep thinking and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should just buy it and take a risk of what I did, and it has become one of my favorite movies ever. It's A * 10/10, I promise, once you see it, it will stay with you and you'll like it forever.
