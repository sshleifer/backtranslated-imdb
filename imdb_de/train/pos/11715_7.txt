This is a sweet little horror parody / comedy starring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most notorious horror hostess of all time. This was to serve as a pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC network. They shot a pilot for a television series to show the busty baby in black, but sadly Sit-Com never made it through the pilot because of sexual relations. This movie is very amusing though. Elvira is the modern Chesty Morgan and Queen of the One Piece. This film was followed a few years later by the abysmal "Elvira Haunted Hills", which were intended as an offshoot of the old Roger Corman films, but fell on her face. Instead, watch this movie and experience a more entertaining experience!
