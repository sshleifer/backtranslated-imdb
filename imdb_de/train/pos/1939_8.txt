I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a weird title and because of the description it just looked different. Every now and then, it's good to try a movie that is a bit different from the mainstream Hollywood hero / thriller strip, and this movie was certainly different. This movie has intrigued me from the beginning, but I could not figure out why until the end of the movie when I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought acting was great and character development really interested you and I hope it will be good for you in the end. I think that anyone watching the movie can in any way connect with any of the characters, and this leads to great viewing and a good laugh about the actors' normality. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you definitely get a sense of well-being, and there remains a sense of the feeling that things will be "OK". I am sure that this will be very attractive and a chance should be given.
