The first series of Lost started with a bang ... and went back slowly. This might scare off some viewers, and the people who started watching halfway were either bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise people new to the world of Lost to just watch from the beginning and not get rid of the slower episodes. Acting is consistently excellent, but why did we plan 5 series ... WHY ??? That just means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years. Well, I will continue to pay attention to whether the tension is maintained and the dialogue remains fluid.
