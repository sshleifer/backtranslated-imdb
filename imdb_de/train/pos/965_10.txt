Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) is a film about "Yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. It is alternatively known as "Big Monster War" or "Ghosts on Parade". <br /> <br /> Part of the yokai of the first part is the teapot freak, Kappa Water Imp, a living Brella, a woman whose screams can become extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with one enormous pumpkin-like wrist and so on. <br /> <br /> These types of bizarre monsters are not just fairy tales, they're a kind of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa era, akin to today's Halloween ghost houses or yesterday's "freak shows," but with only fake whims. Ghosts, goldfish monsters, and dancing single-headed umbrellas were "chilled" in the hot summers. The Fatcheek woman and the like were modeled on tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls. And if their design for the movie is a bit simple and funny, they are all the more representative of what has historically been recreated for summer showers. <br /> <br /> These more lovable monsters must face an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan and disguised himself as a samurai lord. Although some of the Japanese appearances are a bit silly and too many of the costumes are more than masks without moving their lips, everything is played very pokal and is very charming. It has some nice footage, as it would be in a CGI movie of the same decade. In the right mood or with the right friends, it's exciting, moving and touching. Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX director for the outstanding Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not at its best for Majin, but the Yokai are still a lot of fun. The first miike film, which is the most childish of his family, is more and more serious with the GOZU & IZOO, though not too severe for young viewers.
