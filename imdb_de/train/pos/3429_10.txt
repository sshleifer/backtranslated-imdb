I saw this movie premiere on Friday (1/19) for Sundance in Park City and was incredibly moving. Sitting in the theater and hearing firsthand that the agonizing soldiers went by was almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally moved, and although we wanted to turn away, at least we were able to witness as these men and women shared their experiences with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and the film, were present. While they are at home now, you can see that the war is still in them and probably will always be the case. Whether you support the war or not, it is OUR duty to assist the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
