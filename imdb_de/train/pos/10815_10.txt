Well, many would think to stay out of this movie just for the title. If you do not have stomach for bloody movies, what are you reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and immediately fell in love with this movie. This movie is full of wonderful blood and the usual other ingredients that make up a B movie make it a hell of a hell of a show! If you are lovers of good quality, then take a look at this great movie!
