A pleasant surprise! I expected another downgrade along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped movie. Maybe that's why so few have been approved by this new Bruckheimer fare. Smart dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes, and when the persecution came, you really thirsted. Fanboys expect an Armageddon roller coaster: stay away. This is one for the smart action fans. It did not even bother me that Jolie appeared so little.
