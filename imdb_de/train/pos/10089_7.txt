, , , or typing on a computer keyboard, they would likely give a rating of "10" to this eponymous film. After all, no elephants are killed during the movie; it's not even hinted that someone gets hurt. On the contrary, ELEPHANT WALK's master, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without government approval (and his tone suggests that such permits are not available in the area the probability). In addition, the elements - in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic - conspire to leave the Wiley Plantation home vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people (as the natives call them) to end the story. If you see the current version of EARTH, you will find that the elephant people perform less well today.
