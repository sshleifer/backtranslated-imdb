A famous conductor decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There he comes in Dutch with the local church choir, who will change his life. I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign films that are not English, and I've already seen some Swedish films in my life, but this one has been the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, one of which plays the most prominent role. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a thoughtful, almost shy and devoted conductor Daniel Daréus. The beautiful Frida Hallgren charms with her beautiful smile and her subtle acting. The choir members are all well-developed, interesting characters, each with their own story. This film tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who dedicated his life to music and who tries to create a quiet existence in his birthplace while trying to deal with the past and with the way his life has been to make peace. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are outstanding filmmakers. Watch Så som i Himmel, a movie in which you think about life and love, and in a sense, that's reassuring.
