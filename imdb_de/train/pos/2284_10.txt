This is a very reassuring and for the most part a thoughtful drama. I am very impressed with the film, not only because of the plot and the great acting, but also that such a unique film was made. Most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a straightforward British or a massive battle, but not so. It's not about this kind of war, it's about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany posing as a supporter of an evil that no one will forget. When the war is over, Campell believes he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must remain a governmental secret. Returning to America, Campell meets both Nazi followers and Nazi haters and causes interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte pulls the role more than down and fits in well with the story.
