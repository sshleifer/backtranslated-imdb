This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his clumsiness, coupled with the audacity of Cheryl Pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. Some of the characters also have small lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. After all, the story is a story that's always close to my heart, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a sticky, sentimental girl's night.
