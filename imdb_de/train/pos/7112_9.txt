A very good war movie that shows the effects of the war on a hometown boy who loses his sight of Guadalcanal and comes home to readjust himself with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of actors helps to make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as a friend was worth an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence in this film. Ann Doran's role was as satisfying as all her minor supporting roles. I especially like the hometown Aura of Phildelphia from the prewar period. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war in Guadalcanal really showed the horror our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A well deserved movie that should not be forgotten
