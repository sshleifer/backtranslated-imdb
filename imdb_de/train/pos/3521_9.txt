Other reviewers have summarized this movie well. I just wanted the "Phew!" Commentary by a reviewer on Elisha Cook's drumming, obviously with cola. That was a doozy, I have to say. Cook deserves credit for his frantic performance. <br /> <br /> A little thing I suspect: Cook appeared in 1941 as a waiter in the film by Barbara Stanwyck "Ball of Fire" by Barbara Stanwyck. He was a waiter at the nightclub where Barbara sang and legendary drummer Gene Krupa drummed the most energetically. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's funky drumming was inspired in the later movie "Phantom Lady" by Krupa's work, as Cook had seen 3 years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you see Krupa in "Ball of Fire" you will probably notice similar body movements. One hopes, of course, that he was not influenced by drugs at the time!
