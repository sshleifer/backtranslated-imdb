Cinema Retro Magazine # 2 announces that Mark Lester's voice has been dubbed by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all happy with his singing skills. The secret was released in 2004 in a British documentary titled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene received 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation a secret, as did Mark Lester. They have kept their word and revealed this fact only decades after the release of the film as part of the TV show. For the record, Mark Lester has retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
