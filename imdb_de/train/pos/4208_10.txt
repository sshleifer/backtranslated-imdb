Every now and then, this movie is released, of which no one has ever heard anything and was shot in a very short time with very little money and resources, but all are crazy and turn out to be surprisingly great. This happened also in the 50s with many small films of which not many people have ever heard. There are indeed some unknown big surprise little jewels from the 50s that are worth tearing them out. "Panic in the Streets" is another movie that comes to my mind. Both are films that are not really similar to the usual genre films of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised how much I liked this movie. It was really a movie that got better and better over time. Like all the "old" movies, it starts to start slowly, but once you've studied the story and its characters, this movie will be a real treat. <br /> <br /> The movie has a really great story that involves spying, though the movie does not start that way. It begins as this typical thriller with a touch of film noir. But "Pickup on South Street" is not really a movie by numbers, so he soon starts his own directions. It makes sure that the film remains a surprising, but above all very refreshing film. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the characters in this movie. None of them is a really good guy and all their mistakes and weaknesses. Really human. Of particular note is a great performance by Thelma Ritter, for which even a deserved Oscar nomination has been awarded. It really has to be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even if the budget is a bit obvious, it's just a great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
