Hello, this little movie is especially interesting for an artist, filmmaker or music creator or a visual artist, for: <br /> <br /> One can feel David's touch / style directly from a short kinship piece and examine simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic distance of the shots, the pans and the sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even if it's simple movies, this creation is multi-layered. For example, there are some sounds that drone all the time, while others (though subtle) appear in certain places to support specific recordings. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of pans: some go up and down for gentle back and forth. There is a diagonal pan. Zooms sometimes go back and forth. <br /> <br /> The lightning and the composition / arrangement of elements in the room are as usual and obviously a work of a painter / artist. This is noticeable even in this crappy room. In other words, the simple art of placing the gaze / view and composing the scene makes exquisite art possible. Then come the trout of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. The degradation of the light and the colors, even if not too much sought after textures as in large productions, are also fine. This is a kind of sketch by an artist ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated but made with an inner feeling and this feeling gives the feeling / feeling of David, as with any real artist.
