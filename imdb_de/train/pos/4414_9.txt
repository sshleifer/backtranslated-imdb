Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper movies that has a lot to say about life in the traditional way. I actually saw it sailing through Cuba on a cruise through the Western Caribbean. It describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in the years 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Until the end, when the socialist regime came and took over the property of the boy's father, not much time is spent on the revolution. The majority of the film is the boy's growing up and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can identify with. A class A movie with fine acting and directing. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects or great plans or real twists. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumph. A good movie that pays off several times a year.
