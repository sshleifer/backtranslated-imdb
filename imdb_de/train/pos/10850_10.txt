What a good movie! Finally, a picture revealing an unknown side of the rock: illusions of glory. Well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. And with good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Still, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n 'roll I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap for example. Why? Because in Still Crazy people are mature. They have a different attitude to rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, which they miss so much. Beyond the story, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like each of us. <br /> <br /> Have a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack!) and finally think about your own future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
