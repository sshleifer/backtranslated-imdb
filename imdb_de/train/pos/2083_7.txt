This film was an interesting shot of Hollywood on the eponymous novel by Pearl S. Buck. While some may now think that it is stereotypical, the idea of ​​the Chinese protagonists was, in and of itself, progressive. I thought that the white actors who play Chinese were not as bad as I expected, that it was not the Asian counterpart to Blackface. At that time there were not really Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was an actor), and Rainer did a good job with her role. It was not the best performance I've ever seen, but it was beautiful for old-school acting. The locust scene was very well shot and included convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the release date during the Great Depression makes this film an allegory. Above all, the political upheavals that have astonished the farmers and how they seem to be left behind by everything. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the influence of the East also affected it. If this had been a Western family, the locusts would have won in the end and punished the peasant for his pride, lust and gluttony. Here he learns his lesson and wins.
