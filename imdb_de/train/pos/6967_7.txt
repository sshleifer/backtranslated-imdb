A prequel to the revamped Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team as Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, as well as new series co-creator Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is in the Twelve Colonies 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. In addition to her human drama, the new series also highlights the most important steps in the development of the later Cylon. The pilot and the series are to follow two families; The Graystone's include Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporate tycoon, and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while to the Adamas Joseph (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son William the future admiral of Battlestar Galactica belong. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series features some seasoned actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some very talented, relatively new actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with this series, but it is also very different. At least the science fiction elements are definitely present in the pilot project, but a smaller part of this series. While the scenes on Caprica reflect a more technologically advanced society, they also have a retro feel, as do the architecture, costumes, and style of the shoot. <br /> <br /> While the look and feel of both seem to have some major differences, some of the themes seem to be very familiar, religion is very important here as well, while the racial motive, which is rarely addressed in BG, much is more important. We also deal with terrorism, the existence of a soul and the question of whether or not a machine can have one, as well as crime and government issues. The pilot was released directly on DVD in an expanded DVD Unrated version before being broadcast on television will launch the 2010 series. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series is shot in Vancouver
