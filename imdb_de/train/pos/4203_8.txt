This is another captivating and captivating film shot by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something out of the ordinary for his earlier films - a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Richard Kiley play the lead role in this film of a group of Communist agents trying to get secrets from America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters in a subway car being watched by federal agents. You know she's a member of a long spy chain. Unknown to everyone is the placeholder in the equation - a small pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and he can steal the secrets Peters carries with him. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he plunders - it's only later that he realizes how serious he is about what he stole. Now Widmark is alone - with Commies and the FBI on the track. Widmark and the rest are extraordinary and the movie is thrilling from beginning to end. Although she did not receive top billing, Thelma Ritter should be specially mentioned. This supporting actress may have had the performance of her life as a pigeon. Rarely has she had so much opportunity to act, and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. but with a little exception. First, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interact with each other. It's one of the few times you see a woman punching a square in her mouth! Well, that's hard. Later, inexplicably, they become surprisingly close - too close to be credible. However, with so much great drama and such an effective noir-like movie, this can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
