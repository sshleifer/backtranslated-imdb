The young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of depicting a mythical figure while at the same time making him human enough for people to take care of. Maybe it's the best performance of the actors. Watch him stop a lynch mob on his own. Alice Brady is awesome in the role of a simple peasant woman I can say negative things about this movie. Most of the characters from judge to spectator receive so many folkloric, humorous lines that distract from the serious negotiation that is in hand. The supporting parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
