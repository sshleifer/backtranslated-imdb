For fans of hammer horror films of the 1970s, this movie should be a treat. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid, scary little movie. If this is not the best movie by Amicus, he is certainly one of them. The best episode, rightly recorded, is Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - she's really excellent. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he did not make such films anymore. All in all, this is an entertaining movie that scared me terribly as a kid and haunts me to this day.
