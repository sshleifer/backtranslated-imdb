Perhaps one of the most important and entertaining Greek films I've seen in the past decade. A film obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, which could be a masterpiece if, in the end, he avoids obvious and exaggerated situations and symbolizations. Nevertheless, this is a movie that deserves our attention and belongs to this rare category of Greek films that should be seen outside of Greece. It's a shame that Greece did not work commercially, in addition to other fake and volatile big productions like Politiki Kouzina.
