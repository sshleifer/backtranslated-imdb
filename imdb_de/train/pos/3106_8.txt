After watching the movies (and Matt Damon could not stand it), I was reluctant to attend The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> But I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon can be fun. <br /> <br /> Quick battle scenes, crazy motorcycle hunts and BIG explosions have thrown you out of your seat in TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne have kept you going and entertained through and through. <br /> <br /> Still, some things really rubbed my cheese was just a bunch of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repeated and ultimately boring. Although Damon always entertained us and always seemed one step ahead of the CIA, I became a little annoyed at Bourne's continued survival. He crashed a car and got out of the car as if he had tapped it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so rickety that it completely stood out and made me and everyone else who saw it in my class (even the tutors) sick with seasickness. The tutors have told us that if we ever used that in a movie we did in the classroom, it would automatically be wrong and we would be asked to use a tripod. Fair enough, if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were watching Damon and Stiles during a conversation, but we would not shake our heads so hard! and worth a watch. But I do not think it was the best movie of the year, though it's an entertaining piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
