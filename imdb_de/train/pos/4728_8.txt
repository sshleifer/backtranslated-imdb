After seeing 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at the release party, I thought it was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few tummy tucks and some of the cameos (especially Eric Roberts) were a shout. I have not heard a word about the actual release date, although I've heard it's close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The script is smooth and seamless, the plot evolves effortlessly and the drama is pleasant yet fresh. This film has received at least one award from EVERY of the film festivals in which he has participated, and is around 10 to 15 years old. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Break a Leg'.
