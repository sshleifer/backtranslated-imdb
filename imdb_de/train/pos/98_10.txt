Also for me this Christmas special is one that I like to remember. In 1989, I grabbed the 2 CDs I found from the soundtrack recording and gave one to my sister and the other to me. It's now part of my family's Christmas tradition and I would really love to see the show again instead of just remembering it while listening to performances on the Muppet Show and they did more than make a special together. The good relationship between Denver and its blurry companions is clearly expressed here in a charming and entertaining show that is suitable for all ages.
