I have decided not to believe the famous film critics. Although this film did not receive the best comments, this movie made my day. It made me think. What a false world is that. What do you do when your loved ones cheat on you? It is said that no matter how many times you give milk to a snake, she will never be loyal and bite when she has a chance. So some people are so that they are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately thinks only of themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother accidentally dies by a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we get to know the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal. <br/> <br/> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. New actor Aryan performed well. The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show. Her role was small, but she portrayed her role so diligently that she was moved by her performance. Chawla really had great expressions, but their role was very limited and they could not express themselves completely. <br /> <br /> A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give the audience a message. His films are like novels by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist whose novels always had a purpose and aimed at a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. They are entertaining and teaching.
