Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit exactly where both series stopped, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series and refuse to talk about it or make possible reunions (a great example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she'd be thrilled to do another film, and Mary later said the same thing, so I'd be looking for someone else ... but if that does not work out, then they can do it again ,
