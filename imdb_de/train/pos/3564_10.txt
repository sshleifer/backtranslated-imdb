{Possible spoilers that pop up ... You've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my absolute favorite musicals and film musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston.) As we all know, the glamor of a show is sometimes lost (from the stages to the screen). This is for the most part definitely not the case. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can not help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (I'm glad to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer.) <br /> <br /> All actors "bounce off the ball" (that is, they have an unbeatable chemistry) in this movie to perfection , Frank and Marlon are absolutely believable, the owner of the oldest established endurance game in New York and the most notorious player who bets on the tiniest things - like his fever up to 104 if he does not notice penicillin. The sweet, fresh face of Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (though it's true that her whistles are not as outstanding as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal it And last but not least (on my list anyway) Miss Vivian Blaine, who re-embodies her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - the hot box singer and dancer who wants to end her 14-year engagement with Nathan, even from the psychosomatic Cold that he gave her. <br /> <br /> First of all kudos to Stubby Kaye and BS Rolle as they repeat their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two lovelier players than these guys. Brando is great as always, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - because he has that sense of determination to do whatever he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me chills every time I see him playing the number. It is particularly pleasing to hear how he says: "Dad ... I have cider in my ear." Simmons is charming and enjoyable in a role that suits her looks, her voice and her style. They long so much for her to not only win (or believe in) Sky, but to help people overcome their gambling, sins, and other sins and live a life with God. Her interpretation of "If I Were A Bell" is, to say the least, great! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He's so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene never got from the Broadway cast (terrific actor, but the guy was flat-out). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide". I wish a guy would sing to me like this. Frankie's cool, slim demeanor exceeds the limits of this film. Above all, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And when you talk about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just perfection in that role. From the accent to her "Adelaide's Lament," she's just great. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. It really makes you feel like Adelaide ... especially when she cries right in front of you and then again during "Sue Me". I still have not decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "bushel and a peck" ... maybe I like her as well. Either way, she is fantastic with them and "take back your mink". (I'm sad that they're "leaving the movie" ...) She's absolutely MARVELOUS, not to mention hilarious stuff, and my favorite part of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about This film is their language, it is a mixture of high class and street language, they never use "it", "me" or "that's", it's always "it's", "I'll" and "that's". Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals, and you should always take the time to look at it.My only complaint? No, "marry man today." Well, that's a good song.
