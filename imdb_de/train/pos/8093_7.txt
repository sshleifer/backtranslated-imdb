My friend had the idea to see the animated LOTR after seeing the return of the King of Peter Jackson. So I finally bought it on e-bay and thought from the beginning that it sucked. Actually, it really was not as bad as I thought. The animation was good for the time, using a unique method of combining live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who played the voice for Frodo somehow sounded like Elijah Wood's biggest adaptation of a book but trust me, I have seen much worse. Quite a few things are skipped as both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into a two-hour movie. Definitely worth watching, children might like it, but without comparison with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
