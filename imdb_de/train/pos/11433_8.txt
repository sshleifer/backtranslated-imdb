Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of live-action cut-outs animation) is as far removed from the usual children's tariffs as anything Ralph Bakshi did in his heyday. Brilliantly designed characters such as the form-changing dog Ralph (one of a Humpel duo, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the weirdly malignant villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: Frivoli Vs. Murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow they do. Is it really a pity that I had to see this over a really shitty boot (shown from a TV movie) of the uncensored version? is there a milder version that restricts the language for the VHS release ?? otherwise the film is not available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this image in subordinate capacities.
