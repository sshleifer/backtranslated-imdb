This is a decent little movie from Michigan, about a guy who is being haunted by his past, growing up with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and not so good. In fact, he is absolutely crazy, but he does not try to be too obvious. He also has a retinue, his own little demon and angels who follow him. The demon never says a word, but it really has to, and he's Max Schreck-scary. Let's just say the angel is doing quite a bit of this, as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" people he decides they need, mostly beautiful young women , This is a decent portrayal of insanity, and you're sort of traveling alone to find out what's going on, but all in all, I focused on the movie from start to finish because it definitely caught my interest. In some areas, it lacks a bit, but nothing that I can really put my finger on. A decent effort and worth watching IF you like serial killer hits.
