I think that movie was good for a good reason. It's kind of weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have friends and all. I really enjoyed them when they were little kids at the Full House. In any case, the casting was good and the movie was a bit funny. I was somehow mixed between the different places and their names. It's just a kind of older version of It Takes Two.
