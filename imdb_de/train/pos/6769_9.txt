I saw this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember well, I have to say that it was a pretty good show. I do not think I saw every episode either. If you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the title song. Everyone was ideally staffed, the costume design was great. The services were also first class. I just hope a network brings back this series one day so I can see every episode. Before I summarize, I would like to say that I will always remember this show, even though I do not think I have seen every episode. Well, in the end, if and if this show is ever blown up again, I hope you catch it one day before it finally blows out of the air.
