Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best films. The plot, the fight scenes and the stunts are outstanding. In this film, Jackie herself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (in some versions Kevin Chan), who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released for lack of evidence, he framed Chan over the murder of a police officer. Because of this he was wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), the crime lord's secretary, went to a mall and began stealing the criminal lord's evidence from his computer and wanted to hand her over to Chan. The criminalist knew, however, that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his followers to capture them. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and began to fight against all the henchmen and defeat them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord. After all, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should see it. Highly recommended.
