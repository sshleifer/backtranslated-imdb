Twisted, bizarre, enchanting and hilarious! I could not stop laughing when I saw this movie. Darren Stein shows his films made with the family camcorder that grew up in southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivation and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but do not we see all the films being manipulated in some way? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was amused that the boys in the movies seemed to be shirtless whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on his burgeoning homosexuality, and you can tell early on the hints (big hints!) Of flamboyance. Maybe it was just the warm weather in Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in an up-and-coming environment, it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends were fascinated by his up-and-coming talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Set the Camera On Me" offers a look back to the 80s, which were not touched by the commercial. You will remember the hair, the music and the fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so returning to the past was very welcome. His solo lip-sync dance number is invaluable, enhanced by Frankie Goes To Hollywood's T-shirt. <br /> <br /> The films deal with dark topics at the moment. Child maltreatment, Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these issues is, to say the least, interesting and funny. <br /> <br /> Please check as soon as possible!
