The World at War is one of the best documentary films about World War II. The 24 episodes concern the war and how it was in the participating countries. The first episode shows us how Hitler came to power and how he was able to build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also deal with the military actions of war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentary films ever made. You have to watch everyone. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
