This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10. For all people who rate this movie with low grades because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, that's ridiculous and says a movie by Jackie Chan is bad because of its conspiracy is like saying that pornography is bad because it has no conspiracy! You see Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action it's not so much focused on a good story or anything like that, watching how he makes movies and compares them to other American movies from that time, and even later Jackie Chan had superior fighting scenes and not really good acts, while American films had good actions, but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan did at the time. Porn is seen for porn, Jackie Chan is seen for the action. I think people rate that badly because there's no plot, because you think an intelligent movie critic would judge a good movie, but as I see it, it's good movie is a movie that can entertain me. Sure, the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but in other words, the rest, which is all action scenes and stunts, pays for everything. This has changed the way American Action movies were made, they even have scenes from this movie. If you're looking for a real man, a true entertainer, then check out this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's films, he's pure in every way. He literally makes American movies like a walk in the park and even in TODAY movies. American movies are so reliant on special effects and safety wires as well as stunt doubles and much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are the works of a true entertainer, who simply does everything and is very talented as he can. a masterpiece
