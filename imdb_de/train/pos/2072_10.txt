I was about thirteen when this movie appeared on TV. It's far better than most movies ever since. Martin Sheen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also offers excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is outstanding. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "checks the water" in his 34er Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> The end is over grand. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the deep voice that received this. I think the younger generations are more interested in much of the garbage that comes out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste eludes the crowd!
