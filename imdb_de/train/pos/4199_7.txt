The only thing that scolds me about this movie is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget right now or I would buy it because the film is a good example of Noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces great DVDs, but sometimes the price is just a bit much. This is the case for a 80-minute black-and-white mono sound film that is good, but nothing out of the ordinary in terms of cinematography. <br /> <br /> The story is the story (as opposed to visuals, actors) (sound, sets, etc.) as pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently owned with spy semikrofilm after stealing Peter's purse. (say that three times!). Everyone except Peters is a believable figure in this film: Widmark, the Cops, the US agents and the Communists, and especially Knight as "Moe" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars in this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters plays the cheap flop neatly, but soon loses credibility because he "fell in love" with Widmark at the first meeting, although he is uncomfortable with her. Only in the movie world !! Too bad, because this ridiculous romantic part of the story depends on it. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie noir that means good, but is not great and is not necessarily owned at a price of $ 25- $ 35. For this price you could be much better on the film noir market.
