To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animated movie. The movie had its lows, but overall I thought the story was strong and the characters easy to understand. It was also nice to see an animated Disney movie that was not a musical. I had pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music some rest. Another nice feature of the movie is that the comedy was not turned upside down (a la Hercules), rather subtle, so the kids were still made to laugh while the adults did not feel dizzy or just dumb. A disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films outside Disney Studios, you would think they were moving and catching up a bit. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the history of Atlantis! Overall, the movie was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
