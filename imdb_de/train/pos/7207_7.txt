I went to Deathtrap and expected a well-orchestrated and intriguing thriller. and that is something like this movie is; I can not help but think that it's just a poor man's sleuth. The classic film of 1972 is obviously an inspiration for this film. not particularly in relation to the plot, but certainly it is the case in the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days lie behind him. After his recent game bombs Sidney is at a low; and this is not helped when a piece called Deathtrap is called; written by an amateur he has taught comes to his doorstep. Death Trap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to make a conspiracy. meaning inviting the amateur writer to kill him and then giving Deathtrap as his own work. <br /> <br /> Despite all his skillful twists; The death trap falls on a primary element, and these are the characters. The movie does not have a single sympathetic character, and it's very hard to be interested in the story if you're not looking for a player. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine shows a good and entertaining performance as expected, but no one else is proud of himself. Christopher Reeve is clumsy in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to disgust the only possible sympathetic character with an honestly irritating performance. It is lucky that the story is good. and it's just good enough to save the movie. The plot offers many twists and turns; Some work better than others, but there is always enough to keep the movie interesting. Director Sidney Lumet also deserves recognition, as the style of the film is another big plus. The central location is interesting in itself and the cinematography goes well with the film. Overall, I have to admit that I liked this movie; but it could have been much better.
