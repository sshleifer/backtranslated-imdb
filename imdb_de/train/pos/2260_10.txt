A damn good movie! One that is seriously underestimated. The songs the children sing in the film gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg performs well here, but the best performance in the entire film is that of the actress playing the title character. I wish she was in more movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give a 10/10.
