Although this film is not a classic classic, but memorable he is very entertaining. I saw it on HBO about 15 years ago and loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur" and although he is not as funny as this movie, he shows the potential that Steve Gordon has achieved with "Arthur".
