For a Danish movie I have to say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a class of its own but has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget and plays with famous Danish actors as well as some newcomers who play very well. It can be seen by anyone who likes adventure, and a bit of "ghost" movie. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, be amazed!
