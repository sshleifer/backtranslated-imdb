I admit, the first time I saw Even Cowgirl's Get the Blues, I did not think it was very memorable in any way. But now, after looking at it for the seventh time, I admit that it has increased a lot. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and the Countess have become very adorable. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, in my opinion the satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack with the hugely talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at her best. I can not imagine a movie that has "grown on me" after an unfavorable first impression, much like cowgirls.
