"Girlfight" follows a project that moves New York's high school girls out of a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing, where they find self esteem, meaning, and more. Although the movie is not about boxing, it's all about the movie. So much that you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shoot with a sense of honesty and reality. "Girlfight" is not a chick movie and not "Rocky". It's more of a human drama that can be used by viewers who do not know boxing.
