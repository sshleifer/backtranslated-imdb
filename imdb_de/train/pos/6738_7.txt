Where the Sidewalk Ends is a pretty good movie noir drama and is also shot in black and white and on location. <br /> <br /> A copper accidentally kills a guy who is suspected of murder and protects himself, he covers this up and makes it to another person who does not like being, who has committed many crimes in the past, blamed for it. But in the end he deserves it, but before he falls in love with a woman he meets, he's the lover of the person he killed ... <br /> <br /> The cast includes Dana Andrews (While The City Sleeps, The Tale of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (The Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The deadly praying mantis). Good parts of all. <br /> <br /> Where the sidewalks end, it's worth finding out if you have the chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
