National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy movie from the early '80s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and great music by Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates on graduation, he takes the opportunity to avenge his class reunion. One by one, he pursues his classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a horny, fat guy, the beauty of high school, the king of preparation, and even the ugly old lunch lady who served slops to all the kids during high school. This movie has a kind of scary element and some scenes of sexuality. I would not recommend it for kids, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you're looking for a movie with a nice score, complex characters, or special effects, you do not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and fun (and who is not), this movie should be listed in your movies to view the list. ++
