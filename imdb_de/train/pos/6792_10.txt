I remember this game. It was always sitting alone on the shelves until one day I decided to try something new and got this game. I stared in awe as it was the first game for the PS1 I owned that had 4 CDs. When I played it, I could not take the controller seriously. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is so good and twisted that it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII storyline, and that's hard to achieve. When you play the game, you become so involved with the characters that it's unbelievable that it's just a PS1 game because it feels like a movie. And I think it should become a movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this game is a very unknown game and hardly anyone has played or liked it, as it is one of those games on which it sits the ends of the shelves, on it a sign with 50% discount trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those who always look at the ends and try them, and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, that's how I came to Final Fantasy VII, looking for it in a catalog and finding it. However, this is a difference to Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is surprisingly better than most Square Enix games. I would not be surprised if it was done by Square Enix, but it's not like that. Hardly a game is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but this is it. What really bothers me, though, is why it is not well known and praised for what it ought to be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect? It's a PS1 man from 1999. The story I've already mentioned is amazing and almost beats VII. Characters are an amazing thing, they are so involved with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> A definite 10 out of 10 points. Definitely worthy of praise and a well-done role-playing game by a company other than Square Enix.
