JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who already worked with the agency before being named FBI. The story includes dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, the gangsters of the Prohibition era, German and Japanese spies from the Second World War, etc. Years of History; Far superior films currently being filmed. <br /> <br /> Especially interesting for older viewers who are familiar with Washington, DC. In a scene about 20 minutes after the movie's beginning, James Stewart learns that she's expecting her first child from Vera Miles, the scene was filmed at the Duke's Seafood Restaurant on Washington's former waterfront, the only movie in which this one historical location is displayed. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was a stain and needed to be demolished. Through its decree, which lives up to its position of undisputed royal family, the entire area, including the popular restaurant district, is located on the waterfront but without 3 historic churches; was put to ruins. Black people displaced from their homes moved as well as they could and without federal support; just as businesses were simply thrown out of business, only a few were relocated. Restaurant Row was turned into a sidewalk, and Washington had no waterfront for about 10 years (restaurants, fish stalls, boats, etc.). As a lifelong resident, the Herzog restaurant scene was our main reason to see this beautiful movie again.
