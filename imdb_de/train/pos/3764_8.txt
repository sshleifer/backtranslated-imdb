Okay, I admit it - I'm an idiot and I love a really stupid comedy occasionally. I have seen more Kurosawa, Bergman, and Truffaut films than virtually anyone else in the world, but I still have a thing for a stupid comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but is just funny. Some of those films that come right to my mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRILL, UHF, START REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BRAU and the films of Bill and Ted. They all lack snob, but only a zombie or a professional movie critic may not like them. <br /> <br /> Although BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as great as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still a lot of fun. In contrast to the original, it seems to improve on repeated consideration actually. I remember I did not love the movie when I saw it for the first time - possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughter. But every time I see it again, I am amazed at all the great moments - especially those involving the Grim Reaper. By the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergmans in THE SEVENTH SEAL, as you can !! This movie not only offers a lot of laughter, but also excellent music - a possibility that is actually better than the first movie. The Kiss anthem at the end is great, as well as the rest of the Hard Rock songs - assuming you're not an old Killjoy like De Nomolos. Great view for children and adults.
