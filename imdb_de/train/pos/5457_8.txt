This movie is one of the most exciting black and white films of the time in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts Code was enforced. It's the story of a young beautiful woman who has moved to New York and is making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers doing a really good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and makes her way upstairs, sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck performs outstandingly as a strong woman, using men as one-off deals, and barely an emotion against them as if they were farmers. Lily Powers is a woman who does not deal with love, but only with power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a bit different than other movies I've ever heard because there's hardly any background music there. I think it's only because people were first introduced to the sound and dialogue between the people of the film. The few times the music is heard is at the beginning when we are shown climbing up the chain. The shooting and different scenes were fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and the right tricks, making this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a good movie. The end of this movie was not as good as it should have been, but it did not totally ruin it. Baby Face had slow scenes throughout the movie and maybe a few predictable parts to sleep with next. However, this is an amiable film that can be viewed several times and recommended to some people and friends.
