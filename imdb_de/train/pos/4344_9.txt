The movie is grown to the tension between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialogue, the scenic landscape and the great spectacle serve as an excellent opportunity to present the onion, which sheds the layers again and again /> <br /> The core themes of parenting, communication and masculinity become indirect examined. <br /> <br /> In a funny way, the curtain is pulled back, the masks slip off a bit and the truths become visible. <br /> <br /> All this happens in a road trip format. The background is the rural state of New York in early autumn as the trees change their colors. IMPRESSIVE!
