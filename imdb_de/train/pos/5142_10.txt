It's easy to make really general comments about a movie like this. The fact that it is one of the few remaining Japanese films from that period makes people say that they "started Japanese cinema" and "unlike anything the West has ever done".

However, the style should be imitated and does not diminish the importance of this film. Here we have experimental themes and compositions that build on established visual styles and open the door to a truly brilliant layer of narrative and realities.
