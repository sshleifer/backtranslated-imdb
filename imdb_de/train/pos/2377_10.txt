I've been waiting for a long time for anyone to film a faithful version of H. G. Wells's classic novel War Of The Worlds. Timothy Hines finally made it! I just could not believe how good it was! I can not say enough, from the acting to the costumes to the exceptional special effects! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense and with first-class benefits of a first-class casts! It has to be seen to be believed. I certainly did not do it. I have read all the negative comments of others and can not believe what they say. We have to have seen another movie, right? And those really bad comments from this Vepsaian guy, whoever he is, just do not know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, mr. Hines
