Read Eric's review again. He described my own feeling for this movie as eloquently as I ever could. I'm just writing here to encourage you to search and see. <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV many years ago, the IFC, I think. It's such a unique movie, I hesitate to make comparisons. It was shot in northern Mexico, somewhere in the ruthless Badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Sedona-like Durango, Mexico (from the John Wayne movies), but a really wild place. I have to find the novel now to check the original place of the story. Like the location, this movie is weird and wild and wonderful and funny and absolutely not for everyone. It's the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I did not forget this movie, it is indelible. Over the years, however, I had forgotten its existence. I know that nobody who has seen it has never read about it or seen any indication of it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, I'll look for a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** I have been a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez since the above posting and I regret that I did not read it before <br /> Relative to MsMyth's comment below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and in no way commented on the history of Mexico or Mexico, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying desperately to find a copy of this movie for my library. Do you like the movie? You have to read the story and then everything that Garcia Marquz wrote. Incidentally, the original place in history was Colombia.
