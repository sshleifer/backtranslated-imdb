Wow, I forgot how great this movie was until I stumbled while rummaging through the garage. It's a curious combination of a biography of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a superhero fighting for little kids. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part about this movie is the superhero segment where Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's as funny as it sounds) ). Joe Pesci is hilarious and has enough cool pictures and great music to have fun everywhere! <br /> <br /> The real gem, however, is the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video, which makes the movie worthwhile for just this part!
