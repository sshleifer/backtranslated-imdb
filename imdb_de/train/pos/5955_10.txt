As the creator of "This Darkness" I admit that in our credits we have neglected 3 very important recognitions. The omissions were overlooked and could not even be corrected, and the parties involved in the film did not mention it at the time. In the name of the film's outstanding cast and crew, I apologize. Obviously, some of the criticisms that are posted here are harsh, as their credit is made by mistake. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were indeed something special, but the storyline is very strong and the cinematography of John McLeod is outstanding. We hope you as reader enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who work their butts free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
