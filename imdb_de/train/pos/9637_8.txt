This film has a special way of telling the story, at first I found it rather weird as it jumped through time and I had no idea what was happening genuinely and touching. They met somebody for the first time, they fell in love completely, but eventually they disintegrated and caused a mortal agony. Who did not go through this? But we will never forget that pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am quite touched, as two actors have shown great power in showing the love between the characters. I just wish the story could be a happy ending.
