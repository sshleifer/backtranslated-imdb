This movie is underestimated. I loved it. It was really sweet and heartfelt. A family that struggles but is not made into a dysfunctional family so typical of movies today. The movie did not make it a problem that they have little money or Dominican Republicans are like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Instead, Victor is an immature man and must grow up. He makes slow at the end of the film. He has a lot to do, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very sweet and the scene in which the little boy gives himself made me laugh most of the time. A really warm indie
