I have to say, although I despise this kind of show, shock horror, I am a girl, I have to express my opinion. I had seen Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass, and think it outdoes Jackass in terms of programming. Storylines and interviews are linked to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jackass movie the other day and could not believe how badly it was put together. Everything was just a joke for joking with no connection between anything. It must have been the fastest and easiest show ever. While drinking vomit is not really my cup of tea, Dirty Sanchez is a long way from Jackass's league.
