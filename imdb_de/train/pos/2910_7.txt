This is a great movie for the fans of McCartney and Beatles! A great time is guaranteed for everyone. The audience (some celebrities like Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is as amazing as ever: from little kids to old activists you know the words to all songs by heart, and some of them cry when Paul breaks into "Blackbird" yesterday, "all my loving" and all the treasures of his catalog (which except John Lennon and Dylan can claim such a repertoire?). There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> - The double homage to Lennon and Harrison, the first here "solo here today" (the title was included in "Tug of War") in 1982 and was the best track), then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - Playback "The Long and Winding Road", a key moment when Paul's voice breaks as he moves, tears at the hearts that the tour crew members hold in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember the early seventies, when people despised Paul because he was not involved in politics like his former partner. They had to change their minds because Paul is a dedicated artist: "celebrity is great because it allows charity". The film shows different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
