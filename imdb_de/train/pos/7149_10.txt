Holes is a wonderful movie. It has good news in it, like: Be a good friend, never give up, etc. I highly recommend it to everyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a chance for its money. In addition, Khleo plays Thomas Zero. That really helps !!!! Lol !!!
