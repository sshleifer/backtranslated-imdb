Victor Nunez pervades this unsentimental story of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in cinema. By poetry I mean the feeling in which literature and film come into play. The film has something very literary, almost as if a novel had been adapted to the canvas side by side. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many can not. but at other times it is also rather slow and goes below the depths that it once reached in favor of boredom. The movie star Ashley Judd has not made a better movie than her debut here. It fits the role of Lead Ruby like a glove, almost as if she did not have to act. She has a true movie star presence in film and has not really been able to convey the same fascination in her later films, though she was impressive in Normal Life.
