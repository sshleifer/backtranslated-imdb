There are a number of surf movies that I would like to meet without warning. I caught this sweetheart on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s to Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation. So the rest is just gravy. A lot of good surfing is mixed with interviews of past and present surf stars in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. Of all the surf movies I've seen, the Big Wave story is best, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
