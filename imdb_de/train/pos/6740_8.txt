The full-fledged character of the lead role of this film, the policeman who was ripped from his past and is on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique to his time in 1950. <br /> <br / > In addition to the haunting music and the well-written plot, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the agony in him, Karl Malden is distinguished as his boss, who does not embitter nonsense, but also has compassion for those who are in his territory under his command. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this film his own. If there is any mistake, then it would be the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems strangely out of place with the hardened policeman. Her scenes in the caf√©, however, are wonderful and sound true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the small part of her father, is perfect, as is Gary Merrill as a bonnet. Great lighting and mood. The building where the deadly acts are highly atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
