This is a great short form. I think every voice is played by Jason Steele. (They can barely tell if they've heard his normal voice, so do not worry about them sounding the same.) They do not do it.) It takes about 15 minutes Spatula fights the war against Spoon and he hits some weird People. Everyone he knows seems pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General Peterson, we have to get you to a medical unit!" "No, I will not make it, Edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm a friend of Edward, and you know it. Before I go -" "Yes?" "Can I just ... have a kiss?" "Eh, no." "Come on, just a little kiss on the lips?" "I'm leaving now, sir." <br /> <br /> There will be a movie soon. The deadline is in September, but it's likely to be pushed back.
