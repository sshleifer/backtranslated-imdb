I saw this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I saw the movie as if it were not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies. That's why I developed a philosophy very early on. Suppose the movie is based on the book (or musically in this case), but although the plot may be similar, it will not be the same, but it will be different. > <br /> I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (as a kid I did choral work in local productions etc.), but I was not particularly talented. However, I was very talented as a show driver. I was told by my dance teacher and my trainer (who I spent several months a year on his farm outside the state) that I had to make a choice when I was 14 days a week and 3 hours a day on 7 days in the Week .. and dedicate one or the other. I love to dance a lot and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I have just chosen this movie. He is a great movie about raw emotions and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it. I love the movie. I love the Broadway musical.
