All in all a good movie and better for the fact that if the movie had not been made, the story could be hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a native American with a hidden past and the photography is mind-boggling. For some, this may be too bizarre, for others too boring - for me it's a gentle, well told story and perfect for families. That's not much lately.
