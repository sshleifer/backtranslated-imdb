I came to Nancy Drew and expected the worst ... because of the bad reviews of everyone else. I thought, even if I do not read the books, it does not look like Nancy Drew, of whom I've heard. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a copy of the books, but if you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become entertainment on big screens. The plot was enjoyable and exciting, with many real horrors, and I thought Emma Roberts really believed in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were some funny moments and unlike many statements, Nancy never appears as Ditz in this movie. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and sincere. One thing that made this movie good was the balance between comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and see this, then prepare for some scary moments because I was freaking out! Look at this or be an idiot and let other people decide what you think about this movie for you ... a mistake that I almost committed. I love it, I want to own this movie! I also love Emma Roberts now. It's like a mini Bree Van De Kamp from DH. I love it, I love it.
