Kimi wa petto is a sweet story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box outside her home. She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts. Then she leaves a note in which she eats something she prepared, and then goes home because she has to go to work. When she gets home, she realizes that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there like a brother or cousin. Desperate to leave, she tells him he can stay if he is his pet. And as a pet, she says he has no rights and would do anything she told him to do. (Not in this perverse way!) To her surprise, he agrees and from then on is known as Momo, her pet.
