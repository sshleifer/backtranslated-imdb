Extremely tense thriller in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the largest and ugliest nightmare of the Third World in Urbania, Brazil. To make it easy for anyone interested in this intriguing and well-made movie, there is the Mexican feature film "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady, though he is neither Cape Fears at all a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay Hitman Anisio (Miklos) for their third partner (and majority shareholder) in the construction company. The murder is blamed on the city, but things start to get very dark when Anisio, the witty and charismatic nightmare, decides he wants to be the nervous partner in crime, not just to disregard the strict social codes but, above all, to deconstruct that is the Brazilian society. Anisio makes poverty an attitude and he wants to get in. The look is almost entirely hand-held, grainy, the performances are consistently outstanding, especially as the first actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, blinded and confused the viewer with his rather funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in November 2001 at the Brasília Film Fest. He has since proven very successful in Sundance and Berlin. Glue Mendonça Filho
