It should be against the law not to experience this hilarious stand-up show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy goes on for over 70 minutes over dicks, pussy, tits and insults to so many famous people, including his own "family". Among the people who get it through murphy are: Elvis, Mr. T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have never really laughed so much in my life. I mean, if a person does not know who Mr. T is, but still laughs so hard about Murphy as Mr. T, then there's something to it. When I saw the show, I could not remember who Mr. T. was, but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that just makes it a lot funnier. Because that's what Eddie does - he can do those impressions so well that it does not matter who the hell he tries, it's still weird. And in addition, we learn that Murphy is indeed a very good singer. Please take a look ..
