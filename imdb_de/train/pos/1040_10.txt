Outstanding film from 1943, in which Paul Lukas performed an Oscar-calibrated performance when his family head brought her back from Europe to Europe when the Nazi threat intensified. A change was not made for the best actress for this film or for anyone Film nominated from 1943. <br /> <br /> Since Luke's betrayal occurs around her, Lukas successfully deals with the situation. He knows that he has to return to Europe for a secret mission and return. <br /> <br /> Davis pulls out all stops with a Katharine-Hepburn-like tears when they have to break up. She firmly knows that her older son has to follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie that highlights the US's positive propaganda against a nasty enemy.
