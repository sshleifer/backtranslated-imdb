I do not pretend to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi because I am not. So far, I have only seen five of his animated films: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz, the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can say is that I have seen "Fire and Ice" as the most beautiful of them all. It's an uncomplicated fantasy story about swords and wizardry after Conan the Barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation, and vibrant score give this movie a very classic charm. <br /> <br /> First mention deserves the animation itself. I do not care what people say about rotoscopy, but in my opinion Ralph Bakshi has used this technique very effectively. I was amazed how realistic the movements of the characters were. The director's style and photo-realistic character designs made Fire and Ice look more like a big budget boom than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the artistic detail tends to become a bit inconsistent, especially toward the end of the film. Some scenes simply look flat, with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic, moving characters, of course, a realistic action would follow. The action was not only well choreographed, but also really brutal. I would be so brave as to compare the brutality of the action with live action movies like Zack Snyders 300. However, I noticed that although blood was shed, the blood spatter was kept to a minimum. Again a great choice of the creative team, which only enhances the viewing experience by not over-exaggerating things. <br /> <br /> Although I have no "big names" in the cast, the voice, recognizing actors create a satisfying performance; Realistically subject the delivery to each line and only hammer it at the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad guys? Yes I have. Because this is exactly what the story is about, a usual good vs. bad story. Nothing really original in the story, which seems to be just a mixture of pre-existing clich√©s from fantasy films featuring warrior-dressed warriors and girls. Anyone looking for "depth" will be very disappointed. The characters do not have much development and some of them such as Nekron and Darkwolf are at best one-dimensional (but I heard the rumor of some deleted scenes in which Darkwold's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother kill) has been included in the last cut to the Give a depth to the show). In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that the entire movie was just a kind of "tech demo" to showcase the fantastic animations and art, the story cobbled together and echoed to pass it on "Movie". <br /> <br /> A true classic of bygone days, "Fire and Ice" captivates the breathtaking spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful display of fantastic creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta with a lot of action and excitement. <br /> <br /> Would it match today's animated film standards? Definitely not. But I generally encourage animation fans to "get off your high horse" and give this simple but beautiful movie a chance to grow with you. It really is a gem of the 80s, it's worth trying it out.
