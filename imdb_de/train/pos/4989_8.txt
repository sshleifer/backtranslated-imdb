This is very outdated, but that's the charm of this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most pre-code movies. They're just different and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was the short running time, the great acting of Spencer Tracy, and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young's character that watch and enjoy me let this amazing, but fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> You will not be able to find a nicer girl called "Trinna" played by 20-year-old Young, who already wanted to make her 50th movie! (She started acting as a small kid, and the fact that they used to make movies quickly.) The camera, though she was in the blur area throughout the film, often zoomed in on Loretta's face and eyes, and I was often intrigued of her beauty. <br /> <br /> Tracy plays a cynical lifestyle with "Crotchety Man" and transforms into a loving man thanks to Trinna. Spencer brought his lines here with such naturalness that you barely knew he was acting. Although they have small roles, the actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hollow and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions 75 minutes long after viewing. I was particularly fascinated by Connolly's role as a minister / father figure of the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit far-fetched, but - hey - these are the movies. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression trying to survive in a hooverville camp, and it's going to be a very touching story.
