I have watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now, the first time I watched the second half after one hour and then returned for the first hour. An entertaining, entertaining film that, thank goodness, does not have any knuckles in it, refreshes us and gives us all a real insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie, no really bad language or something of a sexual nature that would be offensive for looking at families. Could ask the kids to research about Queen Victoria herself and lesser-known characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
