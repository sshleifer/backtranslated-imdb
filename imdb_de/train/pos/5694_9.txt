Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is great. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective of a man who is just indulging in his drug-abuse and is lethargic about anything that happens in the area. At the same time, the John Holmes character shows a very skilled hustler who can get through the most unpleasant and ugly situations almost unscathed. The movie deserves to be seen more than once. The atmosphere of the seventies, sensual and full of drugs, is amazing.
