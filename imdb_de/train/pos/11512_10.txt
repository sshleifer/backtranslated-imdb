When the movie The Night Stalker was originally shown in America in 1972, it became the top rated TV. Movie in the story. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, he told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (the late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in today's Las Vegas. When it arrived on British television four years later, it did not have the same effect, but my friends talked about it at school Monday morning, just as I myself had seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know about the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it appeared almost a decade later. I. T. V., who presented the "Kolchak" films, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; They found "Barnaby Jones" with Buddy Ebsen to be a draw, and viewers might mistake "Kolchak" for "Kojak"! My only source of information about the show was for years an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy the Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 released the show as part of a Friday night series dedicated to the supernatural "Mystery Train," hosted by Richard O'Brian. Kolchak rubbed shoulders like "The Brain Eaters" and "Earth Vs.The Spider". The opening titles were cut, Kolchak's pipes were removed, and the credits ... well, there were none. <br /> <br /> The first episode shown was 'werewolf'. I can not say that I was overly impressed, but I stick with it and I'm glad I did! I really wish I had seen it in 1974. My twelve-year-old I would have loved it. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder Chris Carter's imagination was stimulated. <br /> <br /> The biggest asset of the show was of course McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was a ubiquitous figure, eccentrically dressed and rather conservative. He was for the supernatural, which was "Columbo" for crime. The late Simon Oakland was also great as Kolchak's bad-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo. The scripts flooded with a wonderfully dry joke. I found the program more for humor than horror. When the twenty episodes came to an end, I felt deprived. <br /> <br /> 'The X-Files' came a few years later and filled the void - but only to a degree. I wanted to return to Kolchak and Vincenzo. I am glad that the show was never revived. It would not have been the same without Oakland. <br /> <br /> I now have the rice books and have read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King planned the first piece (in his book 'Danse Macabre'), as it is as good as anything he has written. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some monsters were barely state-of-the-art, but then what? The new "Kolchak" has completely missed the point of the original. What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - 'Horror In The Heights' Worst Episode - 'The Sentry'
