If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion," you probably should try "The Tenant," as it's a similar concept only if Polanski comes in and plays the schizophrenic Wacko. This is actually one of my favorites in his films - second, of course, after "Rosemary's Baby" - and it's a direct journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former home of a suicide victim. The other inhabitants of the building are anything but unpleasant when it comes to keeping the noise level low - even the smallest "titter" becomes a big deal, and Polanski, the star, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his deceptive hallucinations with the Film always on. It comes to the point where he dresses himself and acts like the former tenant and you realize that it's only a matter of time before he decides to replay his fatal jump out of the window ... The movie is a bit slow and dawdling for an though, but if you have ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know that it will end with a bang, and this movie does not disappoint. It is also best if you do not question the intricacies of the premise and simply take it as a descent into insanity, because this is sometimes quite surreal. Polanski is very good as a timid, confused resident who somehow attracts the ever-famous Isabelle Adjani. We also see him running in the drag, which is disturbing and funny at the same time! Damn, he makes an ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can actually look beyond his thirty-year pedophile accusations - should enjoy "The Tenant" as a fun psychological head trip ...
