There are a few trifles to be highlighted above a scene at the beginning of the film in which Homer observes the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video he used on the television) that showed Vangard's launch attempt , what has failed. <br /> <br /> Next, he will Braun read or dictated a letter offering his condolences about failure. Von Braun was working for the army at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. The Vanguard project came from the early NASA team, which was in a later Goddard Space Flight Center. The army crashed on Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US-made V2 technology, but worked on the launch of a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake might have been made by Homer because Von Braun was famous, but his team did not try to fail. Indeed, the underlying Redstone flew out of 52 and was the first US man with a booster to use for Shepard's sub-orbital flight and Grissom. <br /> <br /> So this kind of movie is so good. Hopefully, it will inspire people to read and recognize these little things, see what's been done, and be inspired to do more.
