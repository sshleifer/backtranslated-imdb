I was in bed with my girlfriend last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I flipped through the canals until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a kung fu movie, so I started to look at it and then it caught me right away and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely uncomfortable. She was such a great actor because she was so small. Maybe it was harder for me to say because of the fact that it was in Chinese, so called English ... but it really seemed to be perfect. I felt so bad for the girl as she always tried to please her "boss", but it turned out that everything was lazy. lol. Even if she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art ... It turns out that the boy was abducted. He is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever she touches to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love she has and teaches her the art of masks ... which is so heartwarming after all the breakdowns in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely a jewel and absolutely original. <br /> <br /> Scott
