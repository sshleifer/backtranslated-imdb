I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when I was just 16 when I saw another movie. Oh!!!! how excited i was and my best friend. We could not wait until the month before it happened. I saw this movie in the theater 17 times this year. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is naughty and a bit trashy, but also shy and unsure with Babs and it's so appealing to see it again. When they sing in the studio Evergreen and he brings in his scratchy voice that is so different from the perfect sounds I get from it, but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like a woman. I even have the long sweater and the long hat that looked so much like her. That came on time on TV and I got my daughters to see it, they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so caught up in an age when everything was extreme, I do not know. The end is still in tears today.
