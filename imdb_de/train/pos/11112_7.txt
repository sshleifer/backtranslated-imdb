Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add Roman mythology and lots of low-low comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, a northern New Jersey mob clan. It's almost as entertaining as Pro Wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gandolfini's very complicated Tony Soprano, a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience. I also came to admire people's contributions, such as the gravelly Dom Chianese as confused but murderous Uncle Junior, the silver-haired Tony Sirico as the ever-stunned Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the double, stubborn Carmela soprano. The violence is sudden and graphic, the body counts steadily every season, but often it's the little moments that matter most. See Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli, late in LAW & ORDER) lose themselves in the pinewood bar and rest in a deserted battle on a bitterly cold night.
