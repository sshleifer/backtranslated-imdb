The plot does not begin to describe the film: A man writes a movie or rather this movie. It is completely self-centered to the point that you believe it will fold like a black hole. The author writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life", but more Zen-oriented and, in my opinion, much better. At a certain point, there are interviews with individuals on the street, and then you see footage of those people being filmed, and then you realize that their answers are being filmed as a script when you're constantly rummaging through their lines. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it appears on DVD so I can take a closer look. Seen at Cinequest (the film festival in San Jose, California, USA) on 25.02.2002.
