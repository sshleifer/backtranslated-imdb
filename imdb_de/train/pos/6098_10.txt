This is a horror movie TV show that does it all right. On Friday the 13th, the series had no connection to the films. Poltergeist's Legacy: I'm not so sure. It may be loosely associated with the films. It feels like they're just throwing a famous title on a show so the fans will see it. <br /> <br /> It shows that Freddy is being burned by the parents of Elm Street (in the first episode I think) and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the children he targeted in the first three films, one would expect more parents. But well. Freddy is basically the narrator of the show. He observes the actions of people in the real world who sometimes get involved somehow. Just like other anthology shows like Tales from the Crypt, there is a supernatural or surprising twist. <br /> <br /> The actor is missing, but you can believe it or not: The violence sometimes surpasses that of the film. This show lasted a few seasons and was filmed around the time of the 4th movie. I heard that it was canceled because of protesting parents. I looked at a lot of R-rated things as a kid, so it was a shame that the parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more films came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
