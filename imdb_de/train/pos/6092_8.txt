Cult classics are hard to predict. Who could have guessed that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, films released by critics and audiences right after their release, became immensely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike the majority of those who hated Envy (testified by a poor rating of 4.4), I found that Envy was one of the funniest films of the past decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue is not smart, the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth student. But that's exactly why the movie is so funny. You see, to appreciate Envy's fortuitous genius, you must enjoy the film from an ironically distant perspective. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Envy? Because the movie is so bad that it gets good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy definitely fits the bill.
