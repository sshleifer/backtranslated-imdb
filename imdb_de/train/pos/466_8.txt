This was a very good historical drama. John Turturro excellently qualifies as a tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the manic effects of the character, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her role as a sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and near madness is well researched by Gorris and known Nabokov concerns such as 'eternal innocence' (ie 'Lolita'). are obvious in this movie. I think I will read the novel now. It was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
