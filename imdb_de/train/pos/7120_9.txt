Most war films shot in the US during the Second World War were great fun, but they suffered from real gaps because they were more propaganda-produced to raise the mood at home than anything else. I'm not knocking on these films because many of them are still very visible. However, because they lack realism so often, they are kept from being really great movies. A perfect example was the John Garfield movie Air Force - in which a B-17 defeated almost half of the Japanese Air Force alone. However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome prelude. He scores high marks for presenting a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was NOT a true story because it seemed far too unlikely to be true. However, after further investigation, I found that it was more like the amazing story of two men who have earned so much for the Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too unbelievable to be true!
