For anyone who wants to gain an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs, which turn black and white and full-color in the middle of the century when modern history approaches (ie the 1960s). > The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the tsarist era. He joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet Communism to his village. His son fights with the native beauty in the Second World War against the Germans. When he returns to the village, the oil industry attracts and we are confronted with Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but absolutely logical and very well done. It can be seen in three parts.
