I really enjoyed this drama by Sidney Lumet. The best word I could describe it with is crazy. It throws the audience around for an hour and fifty minutes and does not let you breathe until the credits start at the very end. Trust me, this movie lets you guess the whole way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino story. The show is amazing of all the leads and even the small parts, excellent cast. I also loved the camera, it made me feel like it was an independent movie. It was all great. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to look at, but you'll be glad you did.
