This is Paul F. Ryan's first and only full-length feature. He has not done anything since. However, he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story. I do not know when or why the idea came up in his mind, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his own feature film "Home room". Busy Philipps carries the film on her shoulders Alicia, a disturbed girl; the ones we always see in TV shows. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in the bag, funny look and annoying eyes (of course, with makeup). There was an event in her school. a shootout. Some students died and she saw everything. Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case, and as expected Alicia is a suspect. But the shoot is just the genesis; The movie is not about filming. <br /> <br /> Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen) is in bed in a hospital room. She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script connects them, by the headmaster (James Pickens Jr). He helps all students recover from the event, but Alicia does not seem to care. She is isolated. So the director punishes her; She has to visit Deanna every day until five o'clock. Then the movie starts. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how wonderfully written the movie is in my opinion. I can identify with the characters and the situations in which they live. I like the reality. These things could happen to anyone. And the things they say are completely understandable. They grow up and try to deal with things they have not experienced before. They do their best. Unknowingly, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia in front of her) begin a journey of defining her personality and ideas for the next step in life; After high school graduation. <br /> <br /> The director leads Christensen and Philipps very well through their roles. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna looks naive and simple thoughts. no complexity in her mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees many flowers, she asks, "Who brought her?". "Many people," replies Deanna; A few days later, we learn that they come from their parents, who come every week. The parental figures are all well represented but not as important as the characters of their sons. Deanna is lonely. Alicia seems mature and violent; Smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. But after two days' visit, she returns to the hospital every day; Even sleeping in Deanna's room all night. When both argue afterward, I think Deanna says, "Why do you keep coming back?". Alicia is too lonely. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie without ruining it is a bit disappointing. I did not wait for that. It removes some of the strength of the movie. The revelation is completely unnecessary; ruin the logical climax that the film could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; and an excellent direction. A damn good movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, that was the role she needed to fly higher. Her role in Traffic was impressive, but this was the big step. the main role. Maybe not many had the chance to see them in this movie, and that's a shame. She has not taken a wrong step since then. She has even shown good performances in horrible films. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who has shown great promise in this film (what a transformation), has little scope for other roles. <br /> <br /> I say the same thing about Paul F. Ryan (directed, cursed), and I assume he's sitting in his computer now and finishing his new script. I'm waiting for his next movie. I hope the best for everyone.
