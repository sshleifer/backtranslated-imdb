This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily proves that there are many producers who create films that are visually brilliant like everything that comes out of the Disney studio. <br /> <br /> One difference to the normal Disney prices is that this Dreamworks movie has no white bang for comedy relief. And there are no sudden moments when the characters break into a song. I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney picture: the birth of Spirit. But it is tastefully done and is not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of great animated prices. Once it was over, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
