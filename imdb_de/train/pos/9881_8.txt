In the west of Hollywood, these trail hands were a rough bunch that could celebrate quite hard when they came to town. After all, trail driving was a lonely business the day before the railroad reached all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming's Drovers working for trail boss Gil Favor did not differ. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew for it. <br /> <br /> With Rawhide's long lifespan and the fact that most of the regulars stayed with us, we eventually met all the intruders. In some respects everyone was revolving around them, though most of them were Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Rowdy Yates, the number 2 type with the herd. Clint Eastwood's western image was sculpted by Rawhide, too bad they are not shown more often. Probably because they were made black and white. If this had been an NBC show, it would have been done in color like bonanza and would run as often as those shows. We would see much more of a man who became a legend for the move. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the show before she graduated. He made a few of them and hoped that the show would give him a bankable movie name. Unfortunately, he was killed at a location to make an action movie that had drowned in a river. If he had lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood. Clint took over the position of trail boss last season and the show ended. And of course he became the icon he is today, not just in the Western genre. Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys. This is no frills, it was cowboys who just did their jobs and fought against the elements and the situation they came to each year. <br /> <br /> You really do not do a television series like this one anymore. What a shame.
