Imagine turning off the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night and then going to bed. You do not have to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after midnight, a car with lights drives up the driveway. Moments later, an intruder shines a flashlight into your darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so scary is the setting: a secluded farmhouse ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's bestselling book and B & W lighting, which is comparable to the best Noir films of the 1940s, "In Cold Blood" presents a formidable story, especially in this first act, since the plot is largely in the Night and rain are roads. It's the stuff of nightmares. That's not a dream. The events really took place in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two wacky-headed cheaters kill a whole Kansas family and look for money that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used the actual places where the real events took place, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! It makes for an unforgettable and haunting movie. <br /> <br /> The two main actors are very similar to the two real killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing when Perry Smith, short and stocky with a thick leg, dreams of finding Cortez's buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the fast-paced con artist with an American-born smile. <br /> <br /> After their deadly Spree, the duo goes to Mexico. Things are going awry there, so they're going back to the US, stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being unhappy as they move from place to place. But it's the life of a fool, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film are fascinating. When the rain falls, the rope contracts, and all we hear is the beating of a beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with its somewhat mundane middle plot "In Cold Blood" stages in exciting details a real story that mesmerized almost half a century later. It is this attitude that does it. Suppose the people of rural Kansas still locked their doors at night ...?
