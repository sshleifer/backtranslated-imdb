Theo Robertson has commented that WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War that led to Hitler's rise and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first one and fifteen minutes of Band 8? Cover this time and, together with the earlier volumes in the series, the existing conditions, I think. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this time, even joined the Hitler Youth and his experiences were very similar to those in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is SO far beyond the documentary films of the History Channel I self that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The ONLY mistake, and it's a small one I have with WAW, is this: the numbers are often not included. For example, if you talk about lending, how much war material was borrowed / leased? How much to Russia, how much to British? How many merchant ships did the submarines sink and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese Navy have in 1941? Which type were you? How many troops? How many troops did the Allies have in total and by land? Many numbers could have made many spectators nod, but I would have preferred MORE! And of course I want to see more and more military analysis. How WHY did Patton & Clark not capture the German army in Cassini after they were surrounded instead of running Monty to Rome and escaping? I do not believe that you can only understand the war if you have seen some of these video segments as "Total War", such as the Firebombs of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, and so on, before you see the excerpts from the extermination camps: you just can not wrap it around - it's too incredible. Unknown at the time and unfilmed, of course, were the cruelest atrocities and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism (see "Flyboys") and some LIVE vivisections of medical "experimental prisoners" who have no narcotic! <br /> <br /> Dave
