When you watch this movie, keep in mind that this is not a normal movie. It has no real story, just characters, a series of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just sit back and listen. The film is characterized by the difficulty of finding a right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why the user commented on this movie so mixed I love the movie and recommend it to anyone who loves one-liners and things that are different from the "normal". You can not really put your finger on what's so wonderful. It's just a weird world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see several times.
