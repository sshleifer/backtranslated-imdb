Richard Attenborough, who has given us great films as "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", surprises us once again to write a beautiful hymn to nature. In fact, the vast and (then) uncharted territory of Canada helps to determine the breathtaking beauty of the landscapes captured by the film camera. Once the film is truly based on a true story, it becomes clear again that "men of sight" are in fact men who live beyond their time, with a historical perspective that only time will give them cause. The cinematography is great, like the cast of Pierce Brosnan, whose performance goes back to Attenborough's master hand. A pleasing surprise is the appearance of Annie Galipeau in the role of the beloved Archie. Film that must be listed in a list of those who really love nature ...
