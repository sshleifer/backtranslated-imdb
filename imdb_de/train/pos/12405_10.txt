I have this film around 1990 by accident and without knowing what I felt like. Many horror fans may have missed this feeling, it would be a typical prison movie, and those who understood it did not like it, because that was not what they wanted to see. The factors mentioned above are probably the reasons why it is rated low, but just ignore it and make a fuss if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has strong suits in all departments of script and atmosphere to act and the jail itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a movie that I have to date on video. Listen.
