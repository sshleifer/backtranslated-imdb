All I can say about the series Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 is ... if you're just a "PC" or have no serious sense of humor, you probably will not understand it. As sick and disgusting as this movie is, it's really a comedy and not a horror movie at all. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the boundaries of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable, so far that he gets so out of hand that he's weird, then you have to see this to believe it. This film is so out of control that a major movie studio could not touch it with a 10 foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best and most extreme works of art come from the underground. If you do not stick to the old formula that people are used to, they look. <br /> <br /> I've seen stacks of dreadful, boring Z-class Indy movies that are just a waste of a flawless VHS cassette or DVD-R. I've also seen piles of stink bombs coming from the big studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie like these two comes out of Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro and blows all the other "shock" movies out of the water, you have to take a closer look at the entire Indy movie scene. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy filmmaker can have when working independently. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is also the other people who have seen and "hated" this movie. Admit they laughed the whole way. I do not think it's possible for anyone to be bored if I see one of these two. So unless you take everything that you've seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at psychopaths about a misanthropic puppet show, you've got to see this. You may only see it for the standalone cult classic that it is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 DVDs.
