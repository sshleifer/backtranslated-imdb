My brother brought home this movie from the rental business and I remember expecting it to be so boring. I think the title particularly scares me off. I can not remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely convinced. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother return to the store. It is very rare that a movie speaks to me like this. I was totally involved in Ruby's situation as she tried to go through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so fast. I could have watched for hours. Another drawback is that I was dissatisfied with everything that Ashley Judd has since done. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie easily belongs to my top ten favorites of all time.
