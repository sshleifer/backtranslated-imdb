In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hot actor after his appearances in streetcar called Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had to reinvent himself on the screen. But Sinatra's portrayal as a former Nathan Detroit helped rebuild Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> It's a great screen version of a great game, and the selection of leads and support players is great. Imagine a movie in which Brando is singing? This was his only and only singing role when he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, the female lead roles Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repetition of their stage role as Nathan's boring girlfriend Adelade) performed outstandingly well. Of particular note is the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, none of the Rockin 'The Boat releases come close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who became famous as a television producer of shows like The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, wonders "Harry The Horse" wonders, BSPulley is excellent as a hard-nosed and rude talk "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers his Excellency as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun musicals you can see, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "It's your cube"
