This movie kept me entertained. Compared to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has retreated to his slighter side. This is far from being so polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about how success and fame change a person - but more importantly how it changes the people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no wrong moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are a bit cartoonish ... but I want to believe this is what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... that's really the best work.
