I saw this movie as a kid at Creature Feature while living in New York. It was a pretty scary movie, but not as good as the horror hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD and it's different from what I remember, because in the DVD I bought there are several scenes in which the actors speak French and / or Italian and there are no subtitles. Then the other actors in English answer what was said. Somewhat strange. Also on the DVD box the names of some actors are written differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Besides, this film is different in that the character of Elsie undresses and is an act. In one scene and in another scene, Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) tries to force her to go out with her by pushing her onto the bed and kissing her while Steele struggles. This scene was in the TV version, but it was very much edited. I'm wondering if there's any additional material that could be integrated into a remastered Ultra Edition? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics have been cut to pieces and sold in all sorts of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and the unused material? <br /> <br /> Aside from the first tedious twenty minutes before Allen gets delivered to Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia met him is good). The eerie atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele makes the movie much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, that would be a big zero. She makes the movie to ten!
