Mahatma Gandhi, the nation's father in his quest for India's freedom struggle, ignored his own family and son. This film is about his son Hiralal, who feels neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film opens in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights India's freedom from the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, because Gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, he wanted his wife and children to serve as a service to society, and as a result, Hirarlal has no chance If he has completed his education and failed his exams, he marries his father's love gulab (Bhoomika Chawla) against the will of his father. Hiralal has the ambition to travel to England and become a lawyer, as does his father, but his own father refuses to grant him a scholarship offered by a businessman to his family and instead relays him to another person who states that the scholarship should not be limited to this family and should be open to the most deserving students living in a colony. This annoys Hiralal and the gap between father and son increases, Hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and accuses him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and ends up on the street with failed business attempts. In enormous debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has done an outstanding job as Hiralal Gandhi. All the best for him, the direction and the script are fantastic, the imaging is excellent. Overall an excellent movie and a must see. I give a 10/10
