This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen in ages, especially for a (short) short film. Basically, it's a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictional, but the filmmakers start by saying that it's just a coincidence when it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) would crash in a plane, he talked to June (Kim Hunter of Planet of the Apes) before he got out and said he loved her. He was supposed to die by jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves June in the flesh. This other place is like a heaven unhappy because he has survived and should come into their world. Therefore, they send the French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to convince him, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he should appeal to keep his life before the judgment of the other world. This is granted to him. Obviously, the love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other, June even offers to take his place. With Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as An English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge / The Surgeon. David Niven was No. 36 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was No. 86 in The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the Happy End, No. 47 in The 100 Greatest War Films, No. 46 in The 50 Greatest British Films and It was the number 59 of the 100 biggest films. Outstanding!
