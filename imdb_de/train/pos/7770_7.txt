"Written in the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the "Cahiers du Cinema," Fassbinder, etc., who hailed him as the master director. I think that's because of the sophistication of his cinematography. But I wonder: is that enough to wear a movie? The show in "Written on the Wind" ranges from weak to fair (apart from Robert Stack - he convinces as a weak & spoiled Playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually a strong presence on the screen, is an abuse in this film. Dorothy Malone as a seductress is fine with the carefree "femme fatale", but she lacks the strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient, but meaningless. <br /> <br /> The plot contains very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (who was never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br /> frustrated husband and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a principled woman, formerly a secretary and now married to Kyle Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Kyle and loved by the Patriarch. Secrets behind the door, a love triangle, frustration, fist fights, laughter, death, etc. - well, when I read the summary on the back of the DVD, I thought I had a treat. My mistake! Why? I try to explain, "written in the wind" takes seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said, acting is generally not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an efficient job. I think these scenes with Italian or Spanish actors might have been fully explored - they would (for us) end with an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What lasts is the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk For me that's not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, read "Aventurera".
