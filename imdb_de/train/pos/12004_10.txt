This movie is a true and historical movie. It is very useful for those who are exploring the LDS Church because it is 100% true. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is very factual, exciting and motivating. There are some who think it's not factual, but it's about it. It is about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Prophet Joseph Smith who restored it. There are such events in his life as the illness he had as a little boy, with Emma Smith, his wife giving birth to his wife, and so on. Most important, however, is the restoration of the church.
