Dark Remains is a simple run. The movie is full of scary images and horrors that let the most seasoned horror veteran jump right out of his seat. Especially the stairwell scene, these guys are good. Although they did not work on a huge budget, things are looking good and the actors are coming through. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings, which may be negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are just the thing, because the mourning couple trying to rebuild lives there, but some minor characters like the sheriff did not convince me. They are not that important anyway. I give Dark Remains a perfect rating of ten, being ten times scarier than any other studio ghost story / Japanese remake.
