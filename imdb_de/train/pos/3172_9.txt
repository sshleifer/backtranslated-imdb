Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is by far one of the most beautiful indie films I've seen in the last year. It's hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the author's debut film. I mean, I signed in to IMDb to find more of this author's films ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what else this author has to say. Nowadays, it's rare to see a movie that's well written, targeted, well cut, and well-played. For me - Cross Eyed sums up what filmmaking is all about - combining the best elements of film to create a clever, artistic and poignant story. More please.
