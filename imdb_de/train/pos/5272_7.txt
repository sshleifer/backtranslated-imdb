Deodato brings us some slightly shocking moments and a movie that does not take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its own way. This movie offers a refreshingly different view of barbarians. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do so. You will definitely have a smile on your face. Not because it is funny or something everyday, but because it is so bad, it goes the other way and will be fine, although it may not be clean and fun.
