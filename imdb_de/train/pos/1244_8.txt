I saw this movie on TV for the first time a few years ago and honestly loved it. Charles Dance is one of the most terrible villains anyone can imagine. His refinement is a perfect contrast to the rude hero. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but his irritating performance here is a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass." Charlotte Lewis is glorious, to use a hackneyed phrase, but the only true, brilliant. Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the stupid fighting scenes and the climatic confrontation. Throughout, Murphy's modern man has suddenly fallen into an oriental myth, a startled and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy play. Like in this movie, we have James Hong, the unparalleled actor whose scenes, even if they are so short, even increase the quality of Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined the beautiful supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The golden child" is stupid; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming qualities that it is a pleasurable and amusing fantasy worth seeing. After four years, I saw "The Golden Child" again. I enjoyed it even more! It is really fun.
