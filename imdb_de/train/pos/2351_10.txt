First of all, I want to make it clear that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is appalling. What makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only take a minute. Where has the miracle of childhood's whimsical childhood tales remained, much like A Wrinkle in Time. <br /> <br /> I say it's refreshingly original, because it's a polar opposite to the masses of all-in television, leaving no room for fantasy or wonder. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add some escapism to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show. The '50s scene, the innocent and rare characters, as well as the scenery and the physical environment that should not be understood as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it. While other TV shows are entertaining, they have withdrawn into this series. It has really restored a sense of curiosity, fantasy and amazement for television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly made it to my list.
