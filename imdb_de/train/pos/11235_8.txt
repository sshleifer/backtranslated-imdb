Nicely done and together with New Travels it's a great sequel! Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode "Vigil". Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and think we have good substitutes for the TV actor in a piece produced by fans. This show manages to capture the feeling quite well, as they noted on the steppe, it has improved with the experience over the years and I hope with a little more experience, a strong script editor and an improvement in timing and CGI That HF ​​will do this will be more remarkable than it really is! <br /> <br /> Good job for everyone! <br /> <br /> (I have a huge weakness for Lefler & McFarland (BIG acting) though I'm a bit tired of "Lefler's Laws." ENOUGH already! Shelby is great (albeit a little crazy) and it's cool that she has the ship Commodore Ian is nice (like Fred Flintstone), but he lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer too content with himself. The Doc, Counselor and Rawlins have just the money in my eyes just like the WONDERFUL Nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a REAL Russian! (Well, I guess Rene's from the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> I get my vote, and the CGI is kewl. Part of the green screen is obvious, but on a small budget that's good every day. <br /> <br /> Really glad I feel and it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some the spectacles are not great, but they are fan-made and therefore may be variable - sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay material is too thick (Graham Norton would be embarrassed). Trek does not pay much attention to hetero couples. Why, then, a storyteller with all the smooching? It's not necessary to show someone's sexuality to this extent - I hope they soften and turn Aster & Zen into non-brand people - I do not treat my gay friends differently, they're just normal guys. <br /> <br /> Musically, it's a mixed bag. I can tell you everything that Trek OST offers, and it works most of the time, but the timing can now go down & then (the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" is missing the crunch and editing.) I love the fact that they are the "Galaxy "use quest" music! <br /> <br /> I can not wait anymore !! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, never surender!" <br /> <br /> Viva les Grenzen
