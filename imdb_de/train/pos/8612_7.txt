I disagree with the other comments in this movie. For example, the film is based on the book, and if the author has a gay character, how could "Hollywood" only portray a gay character in the film? There were also two gay characters, and I thought they were great. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not over the top. And Diane Keaton did a wonderful job, and if the other reviewer had the decency to actually watch the entire movie, they would have seen their character develop through interaction with the other characters during the movie. For example, when she and Adam saw the car that had killed Sara at the junkyard, she could see her maternal side, and later in the movie, she saw that she, too, was invincible. But I think if you worry too much about gay characters that are flawed, then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and do not know what's good, then you'll like this movie.
