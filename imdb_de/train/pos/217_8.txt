THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious screen adaptation of Neil Simon's play on a retired Vaudevillian team from 1975, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had broken up very bitterly and were asked to reunite again for a TV special or similar , The problem is that they still hate each other and do not want to have anything to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as the nephew of Matthau, a theatrical agent to whom the monumental responsibility for the realization of this reunification has been transferred. This warm-hearted and winning comedy is a lovely Valentine for a forgotten form of entertainment ... variety, and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's better scripts and outstanding work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but I think Matthau has left this film behind with his flawlessly witty performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but had no chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OF THE CUCKOO'S NEST; In another year, however, this was an Oscar-worthy achievement. Matthau orders the screen and there is no wrong note in this beautifully timed performance. A classic is the scene in which he auditions potato chips and can not properly understand the name of the product. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a heartfelt and winning Neil Simon comedy that shines between Matthau and Burns thanks to unbeatable chemistry.
