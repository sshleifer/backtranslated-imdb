There are very few movies that are as funny as this one. I was fortunate to see this movie in a theater that was "reserved" for movie freaks like me, so it was not so embarrassing to sit there and laugh until my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves all from drying my Eyes were wet br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but maybe that's the best - a bit of quiet between the rolls between the hallways (I almost fell out of the seat ...) was very welcome ,
