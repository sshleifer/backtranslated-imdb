The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I've had a crush on since the ninth grade, which was his first year at SNL. I'm a die-hard Yankees fan, and I did not find the movie painful in the last 15 minutes when he started showing clips of the ALCS games. I had to shut my ears and make small noises so as not to hear what was not to be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because The character should be nervous and quirky, and he's a nervous and quirky guy. I know it's not an Oscar-winning track, but the movie is just a light, funny, romantic comedy appropriate for both women and men. Jimmy and Drew have worked well together, and they have much better chemistry in front of the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid movie?) I think Jimmy has a positive career, and thank God, because Taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone has to stop being so critical that he is acting because he's just starting out in movies. I imagine it's going to be difficult, and if you look at one of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll find they've started flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? We wish Jimmy a successful career on the silver screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
