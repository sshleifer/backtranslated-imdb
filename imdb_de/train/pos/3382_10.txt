I did not often feel like a movie could be visionary. But obviously, this movie has the seeds of premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not tend to be alarmists and see Armageddon in something because it fits in with our emotions of the moment. But did not we say that of "1984"? Did James Orwell know that the Internet did not become reality long after 1984? In fact, it was 1994; Maybe he would have thought twice about writing his story the way he did. Review rewards. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What matters is that we often see ourselves superior to our environment, but in fact become emotional when a "love apple" knocks on the door. A snapshot of us in our old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timeline will be for us, I know we have not seen the beginning yet. <br /> <br />
