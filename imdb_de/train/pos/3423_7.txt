Do not expect a presentation of the "truth". However, the reports of these veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film is that it vividly depicts the vets and war wounds of these veterinarians and their postwar struggles to reconstruct a degree of normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My main criticism of the film is undeniable: it is one-sided and advocates anti-war activism, but nothing more to remedy the serious shortcomings of military and veteran programs that help those, me I have suffered from the traumas of the war and still suffers. These are not fatal flaws of the movie. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I know that the terrible consequences of the war are real, and these young men and women articulate that very well. These veterinarians vividly describe the physical and psychological pains and torments that most veterans experience and that ordinary people must understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
