The title sequence shows the credits written on a wet sidewalk while people stepped on it. Music is provided by someone whistling Alfred Newman's "Street Scene". Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man did not want: a man on the right side of the law. But he's pretty mean for a good one. After several complaints about his harsh people, his boss Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) downgrades him. Foley tells him he's a good man, but he has to turn himself upside down and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just received a promotion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a grandiose slimy performance) is having an illegal dice game and is looking for a fool from the wealthy Ted Morrison (Harry von Zell), Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful Mrs. Morgan (Gene Tierney) was brought. She learns too late that her husband uses her as a decoy, and Paine strikes her as she refuses to play along. The chivalrous Morrison intervenes, but Paine hits him cold. That seems to be the worst, but later it turns out the guy is dead. and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But that will not be Paine's story. Soon, Dixon fell in love with Morgan - but not before he lost patience again and committed a terrible act he tries to cover up. Morgan's father, a historic taxi driver (Tom Tully), could take over the rap. It's up to Dixon to blame Scalise. Otto Preminger directs a script attributed to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. This is a solid movie Noir with excellent performances and all the shady photography and dark morals that we expect from this genre. It lasts until the brightly lit end, which looks like something the studio had filmed to calm the censors. Of course Preminger's classic Noir with Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will enjoy it, but you can not miss it.
