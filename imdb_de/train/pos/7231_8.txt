The usual cat and mouse antics abound until Jerry leaps into a bottle of invisible ink. He has the good idea to torture Tom without him knowing. The cat becomes wise and tries to do something to make him "see" Jerry, even if it is not foolproof. Of course, Jerry Butch aka Killer aka Spike gets the dog into action (even though it's late and his contribution is indeed minimal). Most gags work and everyone is violent, as a good Tom and Jerry Short should really be. This funny cartoon is on Disc 1 of the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection DVD. <br /> <br /> My degree: B +
