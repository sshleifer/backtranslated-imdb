I've read through some of the other user comments and have decided to submit one too. Some users are in a "realistic" mentality. This movie should be a "fantasy" ... a "what if" fun movie. It should never be "real" or serious. It was absolutely gratifying to all I knew when it came out - though it overshadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old and totally enjoyed it - my little son loved it too! Later I shared it with my daughter and she loved it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that you can only enjoy for fun. All "realists" in the world should stop watching documentaries or docudramas and avoiding other types of films. Sorry for the young people who first saw this movie and were then able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have expected the same environment too in which they were portrayed The film then felt "disappointed" ... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Well. If you love fantasy fun movies and have not seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
