Marjorie (a great and captivating performance by Farrah Fawcett) avoids being attacked in her car by the vicious serial rapist Joe (played with James Russo's terrifying conviction and intensity). However, Joe steals her purse and finds out where Marjorie lives. He visits her on a fateful day. After Marjorie Marjorie was subjected to a lot of degradation and mental abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables and lock him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie doing with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter William Mastrosimone have a stern, grim, and often disquieting morality that makes the brutal brutality and painful slander of the rape astute, and also shows that any person driven to extremes is violent and inhumane shock. Joe strictly perceives women as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal." This film, however, refuses to admire its admirable credibility of making Joe a terrible one-dimensional crawl. Instead, he is a terrifyingly genuine and ultimately pathetic human monster with a wife and a child (especially Joe's sounding confession is truly poignant). Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the leads. They are supported by Diana Scarwid as a passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as a sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin as sympathetic policewoman Sudow. Both the mobile cinematography of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's trembling, skin-crawling notch greatly increases the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real powerhouse.
