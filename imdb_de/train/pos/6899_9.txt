The outstanding star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died much too young, jumps off the screen in this witty, witty, audacious comedy with plenty of swordfights and fake antics. Adorably pervasive storytelling that you can not resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as a love interest. A movie that will be remembered with great affection.
