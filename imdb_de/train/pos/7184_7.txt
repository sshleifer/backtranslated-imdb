I absolutely love this show, but I've seen the second episode first. After seeing the first episode, I could see why people were turned off first. The humor of the first episode is not the best, and you're having trouble getting the series started properly. Nevertheless, I like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters evolve a lot more after the episode and become really enjoyable characters. In a first episode, the rest of the show is not really accurate, which is really good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the show progresses, it gets better and better. So watch more episodes before you judge the quality of the show.
