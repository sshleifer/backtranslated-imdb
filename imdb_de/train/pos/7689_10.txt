Decent, hard-working families who had to struggle hard to overcome all trauma and distress. Black America was a different group in the 1970s. Still full of hope and afloat on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times have been tough, but it's still worth fighting for. If you keep your head above the water and make a wave whenever you can, this show showed how the black society had endeavored to work together as humans and families before falling victim to each other and to everyone else, to the horrors of the world To survive ghettos. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were then and what they became now.
