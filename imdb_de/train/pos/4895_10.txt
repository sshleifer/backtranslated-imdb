It's rare for me to sit in front of the TV to watch a particular program. It's even rarer when I really enjoy the program in the end, but "Last of the Blonde Bombshells" was one of the best movies I believe I've ever seen, Ian Holm and a terrific, witty and poignant typeface makes a really rewarding experience. I can not really express how well I thought it was so I will not try. I only say if you have the opportunity, PLEASE SEE IT !!! I just hope it appears on video.
