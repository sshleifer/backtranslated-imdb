This film was filmed by one of Canada's most absurd humorists, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he had made a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing that he was a heavy cinephile was to be seen at every local festival and in the local cinematheque I had a positive feeling in this movie Hell, me was right. The scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a little twisted and difficult to follow, but in Pelletier-style it's a unique 90-minute climbing device. <br /> <br /> Loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" is a twisted game in which you write notes on the fridge. Throughout the film, you'll have the opportunity to find out who's who and who wrote this damn refrigerator ... which appears in an interesting love affair. <br /> <br /> Great plot, great photography, great quotes from other movies. Should we ask more about a first movie?
