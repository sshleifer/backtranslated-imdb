Hard to imagine that this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy did the miracle is so heartbreaking. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon. It is really hard to imagine how much effort he has made to create this handicapped character. Seeing him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is somehow bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and sexy, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful bondage through his eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor in Christy's success is his mother's support. This seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar for this role. This fat little middle aged woman uses everything to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what a performance for a kid! The love story of Christy is very well done, trusting. Christy wants love and nothing can derive him from the right to love, he is in the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole in love (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw) I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the vile Aunt Petunia, the way she looks.) I'm not feeling well in this role, but every woman has hers own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and agony stand next to each other. By the way, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER, etc.) except GET RICH OR THE TRYING, God knows why he chose this crap! Really a career mistake for him, what a pity!
