Those who used the film camera so early in the century must have found out very early about their potential. This is a good story about a Playboy guy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his doppelganger and he has to face him often and tear his life. There are wonderful scenes in which people bleed, and of course the scenes in which they are both on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the Faustian story is always in the mind of the beholder. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of people in the movie. In addition, they are quite shy of many actions that would have given the cause at least some life. I first became aware of this movie about 25 years ago and finally got to see it. I was not disappointed.
