Some of the posters seem to be less than scrawny because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but obviously they do not. They'll be looking for a bigger Rodgers and Hart fan for a long time than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly picking their liver, and besides, they knew The Bingle from the inside and wrote some great songs - but well, Moonlight will, you is always you, the day after, forever, etc. - to match his very personal style, they come with another fine - and unjustly neglected - ballad, Once And For Always, and a few optimistic philosophical pages in If You're pushing Put your toe on the moon and have nothing to do. The weak plot is not meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin hard if he's more of a friend / mentor to Arthur in most, if not all other versions - so if you ask aloud, why Sir Lancelot whom? was sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and sincerity metamorphoses into a schoolyard tyrant. You will not enjoy much of what is essentially a funny movie. All in all, it does what it wants to entertain, so good luck.
