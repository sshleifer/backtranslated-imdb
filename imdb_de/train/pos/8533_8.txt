This movie is more lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Apart from the bad dub, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to the comic (on which all the lupins on which the third stuff is based). Lupine tries to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness for women to make something out of it. The last piece is not that bad, he's with another woman, but of course he's still number one. <br /> <br /> Many of the other Lupine movies are more like families with swear words than Lupine. Any good Lupine fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I heard so many bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without the little animations that roll during the credits (they make it a bit muddy), but overall it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I would see again in the Lupine III movies.
