This was surprisingly intelligent for a television movie and quite faithful to my own experience with bulimia. It was indeed well researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who had a similar experience because it had all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think I like the fact that they made them specific and smart, and there was no reason to mute the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it was not a "runaway" diet caused by the girls' pressure on the media Pressure that we're not supposed to tackle ... "). Her mother was not completely unaware - too often on television they pick up on a topic that ALL know and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on Oh, my world is all wrong, Doctor, please explain everything to me as if I'm a little kid, "etc.) It was great, that her mother was a psychologist and did not see the signs herself, and the scenes in which Beth vomited were not overly melodramatic and sensational and focused more on Bulimics' need for secrecy and uncontrol The scene in which Beth tells her mother that she is bulimia would have made me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I liked this place. What did not work so well for me was the end that led back to the TV movie world that we know and do not love very much, but I think they had to sum it up. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in America ..." <br /> <br /> And all I can say is that I really like Mare Winningham. She's gorgeous.
