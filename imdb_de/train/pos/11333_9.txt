Just a joke about the weight loss thing; Well, you could lose weight that you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. The same sense of youth and innocence can be found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us of what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's Closet presents a story that is uniquely human, with which anyone who has a childhood can both get started and fall in love. Take a look at it with friends. watch it with your loved ones; build a fortress - wine optional.
