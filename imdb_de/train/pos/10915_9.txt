The RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia to campaign for one of their larger budget efforts for the popularity of The Thin Man. They were successful to a degree. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that alongside and before Nick Charles, Bill Powell also starred in some of Philo Vance's films. At this time, he was pretty well set in this role. Doctor Bradford does not make as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic Blas√© Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Doctor Bradford works for a living as a doctor. That helps in his investigation into the detective, and in this movie it is indeed so. <br /> <br /> He has two killers to solve. A jockey falls off a horse that is home to a large race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something on foot, but it is discarded by the more conventional method of a bullet. This is after he came to Bill Powell for help. Myrna Loy had a more stable influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays it more as a dizzying lady than Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> The ever-reliable James Gleason is the Police Inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed was Asta and possibly Eric Blore, as Powell's butler worked that part up. If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we might have seen quite a few Bradford films.
