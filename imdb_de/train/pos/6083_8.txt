Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and especially Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can say about it. These are four of the most underrated actors in the business and they work wonderfully together. It's like poetry, how they play each other and have the natural ability to look like they've been best friends for ages, even if they made the film. The movie itself is fine and can be very intense for the first time, and the four stars help re-observation to a great extent. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen. The biggest moment is when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves, which almost brought a tear in my eyes. <br /> A good movie, a great cast, you see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
