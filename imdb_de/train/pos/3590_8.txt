I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it would just be another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined Boxing because she wanted to. I liked this movie. I gave it a 8/10. It's that good. Besides, a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even if she was only six years old.
