These nimble and fun 1916 shorts-the era when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy-characterize young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-do-well who must quickly impress his wealthy uncle by he is a woman and he produces baby for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, this does not go smoothly and soon there will be more women and babies than he can manage. In addition, the obligatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of the film's early slapstick. <br /> <br /> Well restored, it can be viewed as part of "The Early Movies by Oliver Hardy" and is now available on DVD, a fine addition to the available body of the big screen favorite comedy duo.
