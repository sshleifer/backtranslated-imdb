This had a good story ... it had a good pace and all the characters are cool. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks, and this had to be the best I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Even when he was little, he was cleverly crafted from the beginning. <Br /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like most, but the writing, the direction, the execution, the sound and the overall design in all respects was just very cool. <br />> This movie scored pretty high among all the movies I've seen lately - and the rest was big budget or better known. <br /> <br /> Good job writing.
