Every day we can see a lot of movies, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie with real feelings, great actors, a great director of realizations. For me, there are two films that everyone has to see: the first is Pacula? "Sofie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As humans, we have to learn something about humility, about love for others, about acceptance of another civilization and different way of life. We also have to fight against racism and fascism. We must not judge, criticize; we just have to love our earthly companion. This wonderful movie helps us reach his dream of John (Lennon): Imagine all people living in peace. These two films are hard to see: watch these movies, but you'll get hurt, but better. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and scream guarantee, but also a better understanding of the others. Enjoy it.
