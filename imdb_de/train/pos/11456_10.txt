Andy Goldsworthy is a first-rate Taoist master and expresses the way through his sublime fleeting art. In fact, time and change are all about his work. I bought his first book a few years ago and my family has often admired it. It was a pleasure to meet the artist in person through this film. He is as patient and gentle as one would expect, and has some wonderful things to say about nature, the deepest of which is expressed in his occasional inability to even say it in words. He is like most children who play alone in the wild (if they do more), putting things together out of sticks, sand, mud, and snow before they outgrow them. Mr. Goldsworthy has been given the gift and mission of broadening this kind of game to create profound natural visions and to open our often tired eyes in a brilliant new way. And always with the highest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondrous monk.
