The photograph of this money budget production is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish, and the photography looks very 80s. Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and also TV movies. * And * At first, the movie seems to torment the viewers with glaring images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work by this overrated, untalented composer. However, if you're ready to watch the movie, you'll be rewarded with a very moving family story, a kind of European version of Edna Ferber's family epic Giant. While you first wonder why Clara married this idiot man, even his character becomes more profound and more background for judging him. Clara delivers the spiritual lesson of the film, a great and moving statement that addresses the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and eventually tries to live off it. The way the plot was structured so that the end reflected the beginning was great. The actors are doing a great job as well. I was wondering "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" All the time, but of course it was a really young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie really made me read the book.
