The original with Barbara Stanwyk is only saved by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too sweet and the movie itself is too old to really enjoy today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, free-spirited single woman who becomes pregnant and refuses the help of her friend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underrated imagination). She picks up her daughter Jenny, who has lovingly played by Trini Alvarado, and concludes that Jenny's dad can make it better for her and ultimately make a life-changing decision. There is a lot of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments throughout the movie, mostly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason plays as Jenny's stepmother, who, though wealthy, is a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with a lot of emotion, you'll love Bette Midler's version of STELLA.
