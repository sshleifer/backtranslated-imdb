This movie is just amazing! I had expected something completely different from the movie I actually saw. However, it is very instructive in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its association with the behavior of animals. Let me warn those readers of this article who are easily offended by sexual content, because the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a kind of pornography. There is even a scene that comes very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile I strongly recommend to see this rare work of "sexual art". Incidentally, every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. One should not forget how the times have changed! <br /> <br /> See it! It's worth your money and your time!
