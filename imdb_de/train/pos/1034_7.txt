I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though it seems a bit preachy and static these days to make it big. The film takes place in 1940 - shortly before the US entry into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very respectable and decent head of the family. He is a German who fought the Nazis for seven years and avoided arrest. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-lived wife, who has managed from time to time to educate and raise the children without him. As the movie begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the US and for the first time in years they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was also perfect and decent - they seem to be seemingly positive propaganda rather than a real family suffering from real problems. Although this had a very noble goal at that time, it seems only spurious today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely script-driven dialogue the children used did not ring. It sounded more like anti-fascist speeches than the voices of real children. They were therefore extremely annoying - especially the smallest, who sometimes went out as a brat. The only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as the Romanian Romanian scumbag (though he had no discernible accent). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett has written this dialogue because it does not sound lifelike. The story was based on the play of his lover Lillian Hellman. The basic idea and plot of the story is good, but the dialogue is sometimes just bad. All in all an interesting curiosity and a movie with outstanding moments ... but that's really all.
