This is the only full-length feature film about the world of the bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but then the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they make a living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the clothes are really beautiful, too bad the film is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely funny. There is no way on the earth bridge that will ever be like this. <br /> <br /> See it as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
