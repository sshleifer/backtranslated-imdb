I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film shows Scott Cohen from his parole in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother died, and he undertakes a journey to slowly restore his estranged relationships with the wife and child of his brother and his father, who never forgave him the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and enables you to understand the complexity of your life more deeply. The imagery of the woodworking industry and the background of Brooklyn set the tone for this rich and informative family portrait.
