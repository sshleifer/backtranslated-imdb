Had this movie been shot a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. For 1909, however, this was a stupid little movie that can hold its own pretty well today. Do not try to compare this silent movie to later silent films - the industry has changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the twentieth century did not look like films made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This film is 11 minutes long (about average for the then films) and is a variation on the story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I will not go into it because I do not want to ruin the movie. Suffice to say that it is very scary !!
