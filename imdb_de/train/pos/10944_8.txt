The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than the other shows. No laughter, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you are like me and love comedy, this is probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings out with ease - funny and right-here-funny. A mix of different styles that makes you alone. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a comparison war with, since it has absolutely nothing to do with it (other shows). , This show is a separate entity, and I think most comedy minds will love it. <br /> <br /> Go and look.
