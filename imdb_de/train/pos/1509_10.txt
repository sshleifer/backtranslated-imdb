The British horror film was in its final stages at the beginning of the seventies, but the blackness produced three films that were among the best on our island. The Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw, and The House That Dripped Blood made the future look rosy, though many people knew at the time that there would be none. THTDB has the kind of cast that could easily be a wish list if it had not actually been put together. In the murky hinterland of 2008, you might expect to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and of course my favorite. Cushing's life and art are so closely related that one can not see where the performance ends and the pain begins. One can only guess how this role has affected such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and the virgin. RIP Peter.
