The moment I started to look at it, I realized that I saw a quality production. So, I was not surprised that the script was written by Andrew Davis and produced by Sue Birtwhistle. Both brought us the excellent production of Pride and Prejudice from the year 1995! My only criticism here is that Emma did not run on 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was great, I think Prunella is excellent as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as well. The language is a pleasure to hear. Can you imagine today addressing someone correctly without actually pronouncing a dirty word? Samantha Morton was excellent, since Miss Smith was indeed just like Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I saw it twice in two days !! Thanks again to BBC for another quality piece of television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's fine, but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production, which I love to own on DVD !!!
