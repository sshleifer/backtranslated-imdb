First of all, I do not like almost all the films of Neil Simon. But there is something unique about me that attracts me, and I would say it's one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen. The second time the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, afraid they could sue, so he turned them into men. And how boring it would be if they were only housewives. Show Biz stars are more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my still-living grandmother at the age of 97 (she even survived Walter Matthaus's magnificent personalization!) Would deny that - but some of you need to resonate in these characters. Second, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he has shown one of the nicest frills I can remember (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, though she did not recognize the remarkable similarities with the movie character Very ethnic in taste and beyond you will either laugh and laugh or switch off. For me, the pleasure remains.
