An underrated addition to the Graham Greene movie canon - his perceived mistakes can now be considered virtues. Director Shumlin, director of the theater, sums up his plot with a depressing rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inappropriate compositions make it imperative to recognize discomfort. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral renewal (for the female character! In a '40s thriller!), The film has an upright hero who becomes crazy and murderous (and possibly pedophile) bringing with him the distant ideologies of the Spanish Civil War There is a terrible murder, amazing insights into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approach to Green's God and an ending that is only happy if you do not know anything about the story.
