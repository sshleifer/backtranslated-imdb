This movie has changed everything for me ... I've heard of breakdancing and hip-hop but have never seen it professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old boy from Holland!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I was actively involved in the hip-hop movement of our city, started breakdancing and wrote lyrics. <br /> <br /> Until today I consider this film as a personal favorite. Sure, the meaning of the movie and "cinematography" may not be that important. But who cares if the wide-angle shot was taken badly or if you see a microphone hang over someone? It matters what it does to you personally ...
