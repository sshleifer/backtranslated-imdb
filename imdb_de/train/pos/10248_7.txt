I heard about this movie for the first time when I bought the 1976 "Snuff". I've been told that Devil's experiment is much better, so of course I ordered the Guinea Pig Box Set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen came out when he tried to ban this movie or the second movie. Therefore, my interest was aroused. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film with no history and no character development. Only 3 men torture a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, such as punching her, turning her around in circles, forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to hear a loud noise for 24 hours, smashing her hand with a mallet Burning and laying maggots the burns, she threw her courage and finally pushed a sharp needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> I have to say that a lot of the film was fake, like the beating scenes. But then some of it was done really well, as far as it spoiled you. The scenes in which the woman is whirled around in circles make me dizzy at the sight. Or it is painful to think of the scene in which she is forced to hear sharp noises for 24 hours. The worst thing is the eye scene. I did not make a trigger when I saw it, but I just thought, "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low-budget movie." I really enjoyed the movie, but I do not know if I can really recommend it if you have not seen what the horror genre has to offer. 10.7
