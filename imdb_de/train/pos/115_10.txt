Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. A Kafka-style story about the impossibility of victory or survival in an eternal alien world. Life is just an exercise in adaptation in this film. Lesson on boundaries and original sin, on the frailty of innocence and errors. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of a fundamental crisis that has many aspects, such as chimeric wars or unattainable search for truth / essence / golden age. War, peace, business or lie are just details of the gelatin time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - a gathering. The only sacrificial method to understand a painful reality.
