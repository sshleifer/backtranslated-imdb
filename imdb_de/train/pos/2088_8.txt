From the upper shelf of great Classic Books comes this masterful story by Pearl Buck. The book like the movie is called "The Good Earth". It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who starts his day with a trip to the "Big House", where he took a slavegirl named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife Has. Almost from the beginning, she adapts to his friendliness by rescuing a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. In the following years, O-Lan proves its worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's labors, problems, and changing fortunes. Over the years, they pull together a family and watch their simple household weather both feasting and starving. In fact, at the very bottom of their lives, everyone realizes the value of camaraderie, loyalty, and love. With the changing times, her growing family is supported and threatened by friends and relatives, but compassionately tolerated by her uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a rogue and charlatan. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) to remind him of the fragile and volatile nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's Elder Son, and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted to the novel. Highly recommended for every audience. ****
