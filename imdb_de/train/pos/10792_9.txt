Good show, very entertaining. Good marshal art spectacle. Good action. The entire main crew did a good job of Robert Urich over Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung and, above all, a BIG hand on Judson Mills. A particularly nice homage to Robert Urich in his last days. A LARGE ! Actor who is really missing.
