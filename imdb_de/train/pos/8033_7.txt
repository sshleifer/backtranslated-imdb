Zane and Beringer keep you on the edge of the seat. Usually I do not go for military / war movies, but that was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also humorous. Beringer's character proved heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character evolved throughout the movie. He was not just a suit, he has definitely proven he can be a hero and handle a weapon. <br /> <br /> The end through me a little bit. It did not really fit with the action in the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it anyway. <br /> <br /> It's worth trying.
