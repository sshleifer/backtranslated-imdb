I've read in previous comments that this movie loses power towards the end of the movie and also has a similar ending to Cape Fear. I do not agree at all. I will give a simple review for the normal cinema audience. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought that was one of Ed Harris' best achievements. What a bad psychopath !!! I have great respect for his acting after watching his performance in this film. I was excited throughout the movie. If you like Mystery Thriller, this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also saw a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!
