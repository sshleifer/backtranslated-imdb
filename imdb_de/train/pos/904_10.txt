Suraj Barjatya is best in films about marriage. And here he is; back to his basics to Vivaah. As history says, this is a story from engagement to marriage. A movie that you can see with your whole family in your area. A movie you'll hate alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is best, everything about the film has a class of its own. There are many scenes that will make you cry. If you look at the movie with your sweetheart, you both will definitely hold each other's hands until the end of the movie is reached & Amrita Jodi has already given us some successful films like Ishq Vishq & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, he was not well received by the public. A real Shahid & Amrita movie.
