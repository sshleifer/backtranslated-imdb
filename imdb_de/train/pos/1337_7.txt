......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new theme for Bollywood. The theme has been accepted, but it is a long way from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell the truth, the topic is presented very clean. But the plot has many clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented very "cinematic". There are some very small action holes. The movie will be recorded as soon as Rani has a miscarriage that makes you feel like watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the whole family sequence felt exaggerated in the beginning. The spectacle could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes lets you down. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is written so well that you applaud every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was appropriate. Throughout the movie, you feel the most about her character, but Preity Zinta overshadows her. Preity Zinta is perfect picture. Of the three, she gives everyone the money. It is surprising how convincing she can be if she is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far away from your neighbor. This role is one of the reasons why I rate it high. The cast is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning to the plot, but I found it bearable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title song is together with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts) my favorite. Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World's Sight) are two songs that go perfectly with the movie. Preity's cabaret number Diwani Diwani (Crazy) could have been cut, while number 1 Punjabi got bored even though he danced well. Otherwise, the film is definitely worth a visit.
