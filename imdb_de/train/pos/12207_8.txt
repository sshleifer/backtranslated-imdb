After all, you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice, simple plot and a polish of the image of a happy star. <br /> <br /> You see theatrically enhanced characters conflicting with colorful and unusual locations, imaginatively illuminated and scored, bravely photographed, and all of it with unexpected surprises that a smarter director would either avoid or not even think about? <br /> <br /> As usual, Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero. a young Irish sailor who had been tapping the world and seeing evil, but still maintaining his clear faith in the goodness of others? Unfortunately, he put that trust back in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks hid a bleak past and murderous leanings for the future. She was married without love, with an impotent, crippled lawyer. She looked like a mischievous lizard of the brilliant Everett Sloane. <br /> <br /> Behind all this is a youthful romance that has become an exuberant game in "The Lady from Shanghai". Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped? to a last triangular showdown in a Hall of Mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles has not missed a chance throughout the movie to counteract the words and actions with visual details that enrich the texture and enhance the atmosphere. His camera almost seemed to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and long limbs as she playfully pulled the young sailor into her net.
