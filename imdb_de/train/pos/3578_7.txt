12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are hampered by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or feel that it is not the right one). His ONLY refuge is his grandfather, who is the ONLY one who seems to have pity on him. Realism will delight movie lovers, but they will not be thrilled by those who want action and thrills.
