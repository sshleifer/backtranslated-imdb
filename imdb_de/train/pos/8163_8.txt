Corbin Bernsen is Dr. Alan Feinstone makes an extremely intense and intriguing appearance, a wealthy and successful dentist in Beverly Hills obsessed with perfection. When he finds out that his pretty blond baby trophy wife has cheated on him and the IRS is following him for tax issues, Feinstone breaks under pressure and goes around the corner. Director Brian Yuzna, who is working on a suitably dark, humorous and denied screenplay by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes the seething neuroses and psychosis that lurk beneath the squeaky, clean, well-groomed surface of handsome wealthy rich America, vicious cheerfulness bubble. In addition, Yuzna continues to spice up the grisly processes with a wicked twisted sense of pitch-black gallows humor. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Fine Stone; expertly projecting a truly disturbing underlying creep right behind Feinstone's deceptively quiet and safe veneer. The side cast is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feinchicks bitch, unfaithful wife Brooke, Earl Boen as smarmy, haunting IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as a lively assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as cheeky assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as fun office manager Candy, Virginya Keehne as a sweet, smart teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as a thorough, no-nonsense detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs' equally crafty partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as a female stud muffin pool cleaner Matt and Mark Ruffalo as a maker of sleazeball Steve Landers , The premium make-up f / x is as bloody, brutal and exciting as it should be. The polished cinematography by Levie Isaaks offers many great, crazy camera angles and a few delicious close-ups. Alan Howarth's spirited Shuddery rating also hits the meat-stinging spot. A delightfully spoiled pleasure.
