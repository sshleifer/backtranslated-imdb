Who would have thought that Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? However, this is just one of several strange and wonderful things in the 1950s Ultimate Movie that describes teenagers and battle creatures that can best be described as a cause-free rebel who knows God from space. The rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less biting), a good kid who's just wild enough to be interesting; The very healthy and yet understanding friend is the previously mentioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was interrupted by youthful Hot Rodders, but they are much more stunned when they come across a gelatinous, man-eating What Is It that hits Earth with its own Hotrod Meteor - devouring the city dwellers right and left. But will the adults believe them? Of course not what they know, they are just kids! <br /> <br /> The movie is a bizarre teen who fucks best. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many soulful looks in the eye, and the "adult" supporting actor probably says "kids!" very third sentence or something. But the real pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well imaginable, well executed and often creates a surprising tension. And while clearly on the cheap side (look at these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie - and there's this catchy little title song tossed for good reason. The over 40 spectators (including me) will enjoy the movie as a nostalgia, but that will not stop them from honing their late-set full-cream white-bread sensibility directly with the younger set, and the movie would be a great choice Family movie night or for a more sophisticated gathering of "adults only". Make lots of jello cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
