I have enjoyed Law and Order's Criminal Intent for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, detective Alexandra Eames, the detective, is pretty tough and looks a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. Look at their other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the wonderful soft side of these talented actresses. If you're a fan of Criminal Intent, this movie is an eye-catcher in your acting and you get a damn good stuff yarn from familial needs in the south. <br /> <br /> I did not like the role of Albert Finneys in this film because he was doing such a convincing acting job in older South America that is stubborn and intolerant and does not accept change. He reminds me of so many men of my youth and the depiction is divine, but you will probably find it hard to find in this movie. Katryn Erbe is easy to like in this film and why I recommend it. It's a 10-star star for fans of crime intent, law and order.
