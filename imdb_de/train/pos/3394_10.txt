I happened to watch this movie and bought it as a B-side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a different league. I bet that's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I've never seen before. Heston, casually going to bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else that is completely independent! A whole crowd is picked up by a fleet of mechanical excavators! A priest who makes a confession and is shot by the confessor. Ok, maybe that's been done since then - but there are not many films that are so consistently original. And what's going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple or what? Fortunately, I have seen this movie without knowing the end - which seems to be rare. Then I looked at it again and enjoyed all the little hints that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and also some great sets. Just when you thought you had seen everything. , ,
