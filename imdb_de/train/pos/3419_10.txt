I just welcomed my one-year, 23-year-old daughter from Iraq, Camp Anaconda Medical Support Unit, and felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear the feelings of other returning veterinarians to try to understand their mentality better on arrival and not to wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your attitude to war and peace, this movie is a great start for all Americans to start healing our veterinarians. The outstanding statement of the entire film is "Take Action" to the problem. Incredible emotional movie. I warmly recommend this film to the veterinarian of the entire mature family and ask them to follow a plan to hear that comfort will help the returning veterans of the Gulf War Enduring Freedom. My daughter has seen this DVD. Has acknowledged her feelings and actually committed to getting up for another 6 years. Spending her time in the sand is that she has done something good. Balad local children received first-rate medical treatment for a variety of common ailments that usually can not be matched with an escort and a translator. Her eyes were over her shoulder during her Iraq tour. "We changed some hearts and thoughts there." Great DVD, you have to stay open and see all the pages
