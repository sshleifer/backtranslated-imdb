This is one of the few films that I can watch again and again. If you have never seen it, try it. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me a lot, it reminds me of Julia's premature death. It is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much in this time of horror and fear.
