The message of a world on the brink of war is ignored by the masses; The mythical city Everytown of 1940 represents England in general, but could be just as good for any nation in the world. When the war finally comes, the devastation will not continue for another five years, but until 1966, when Everytown is completely destroyed. Add to the desolation and the tribute to humanity, the "Wanderkrankheit", a plague that lasts four years. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" reconciles a fatalistic and a futuristic view of the world in which science endures a hope for a revitalized civilization. The concept of "Wings Over the World" seems a bit hackneyed, although his spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is constantly being amplified throughout the film and convincingly brought home in Massey's end of the film language. The unquenchable need of man to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires a mindset of "everything in the universe or nothing." <br /> <br /> The filming of Automation and Machines in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent movie "Metropolis." As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed in 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth beats The architecture of modern day cities suggests that the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition: where the film goes wrong after sixty-seven years, man's first mission is on the moon, but in 1936 a one-hundred-year schedule seemed likely Being more legitimate than 1969. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" is one of those rarities in the film, a thought-provoking image, which side you will come to, the forces of ascension in the face of uncertainty or maintaining the status quo? This is not an easy question, since both decisions provide inherent dangers and unrecognizable outcomes r decide spectators are at risk of being swept away by forces beyond their control.
