The flake is mistreated as a "Se7en" rip-off. There is really no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the similar scenery in the final showdown. Well, since this is out of the way, I will go into more detail why The Flock is very interesting in some ways. Most of the time, it's more of a drama than a full-fledged thriller about a very attentive social worker who oversees sex offenders. At the very beginning you can clearly see that his work has defeated him. Apparently, in two scenes in which he first interviews a man and beat him up, and secondly, when a woman tries to pick him up, and all he can think about, his standard questions are from his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good as Errol Babbage the aforementioned social worker. His method of working is not unlike that of a police officer, he wears a gun and constantly scrutinizes newspapers and provides information to the magistrate as to whether some of his "herd" could be responsible for a sexual crime. He is also a person who has lost all joy in life, and his only relief seems to be that he gives justice to his flock Vigilante. Twice you smile at him, once he apologizes for treating his partner rude, and the other after beating up a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> The Flock is not as successful as a suspense movie. Somewhat confusing and with a few irritating potholes, but it has some striking standards. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Flock is a solid drama about a man doing a dehumanizing job, and in the end he has to work hard not to be swallowed by the abyss surrounding himself. The world we live in is a pretty sick place, and the further you can part with the worst, the happier you are. The herd brings this point across well.
