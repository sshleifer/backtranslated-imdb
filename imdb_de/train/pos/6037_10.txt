What a GREAT British movie, a screaming good laugh and the sexy Gary Stretch, and oh, lots of bikes and the beautiful Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Members of our club, the ARROWHEAD Bike and the Trike Social Club, appear in it Extras! Hooray!! <br /> <br /> There are some really funny plays, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> He met director Jon Ivay at a show in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and a good laugh. This movie needs to be supported, as all major Brit films should do this! <br /> <br /> So please go and see if you can, they have a website with cinemas showing them. So find one near you! /> <br /> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have already seen the movie two or three times and can not get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
