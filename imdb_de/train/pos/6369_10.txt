I loved this movie! I'm biased because I'm a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed it. The action starts at the beginning of the movie and just keep going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not spend so much time developing the character (my husband pointed that out) and there are no musical numbers. It's strictly action adventure. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, young or old.
