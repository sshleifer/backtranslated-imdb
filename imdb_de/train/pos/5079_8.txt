Well, first of all, I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated means "protection". On the other hand, Khakhee refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> Also, the Tamil film industry is pretty much full of purely commercial ventures, any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie would be a testament to that statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a great soundtrack. Surely very stunning in the final scene, especially love the end (which is certainly unexpected!). The Gore is sometimes too much, but surely this is a great movie!
