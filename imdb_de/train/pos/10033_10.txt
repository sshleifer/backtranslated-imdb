The movie Titanic does much more than just a "memorable night". It is a tragic historical event that is always talked about and never forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Could / will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you look at it. Could you ever replace such an epic masterpiece? It will be almost impossible. The director undoubtedly had the greatest influence on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to watch) that has been transformed into an incredible romance. Yeah, I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you because you'll never see such a romance. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime spectacle. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazing picture and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and alive. The legend "TITANIC" itself is presented brilliantly in all classes, also the appearance and the accommodation. Acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best roles. Nobody could have done better. They are partly the reason why the movie is so great. <br /> <br /> I think it's not much to talk about. The plot is simple: the spectacle is brilliant, based on a true story. More than half of the consumers watching the movie are likely to share tears, thanks to an unimaginable end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie, you will miss something Hesterian and a movie to be revered for Hollywood. Could it get better? No not at all. The most moving movie of all time, do not listen to people, convince yourself, then you will understand. A landmark. (do not be surprised if you cry too)
