... Actually rather well done - attack the evil villains in their hiding place, stop an ambush in the style of a little big horn, save the day over the trick of the waterboys and work for me. Stiff British upper lip and all that. How is it on a DVD 66 years later? I felt like a Western using Apache or Sioux for the Thugs and the US Cavalry for the British Imperial Army. It's very colonial in his perspective, you know? The burden of the white man and all that? Kipling would certainly have endorsed that. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play as far as they can and add a good buddy-buddy slapstick to the mix between shootings and brawls. (I had no idea that Joan Fontaine was the symbolic army woman - did she leave some scenes on the tailoring floor? Very shortly -) None of them wanted an Oscar here - in fact, Grant was not going to be in some scenes Best - but still, it still works. And where else would Ben Casey land as an Indian trumpeter? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. Look at this, if you like adventure and pseudo-western antics. It was done by a few professionals, well, I could add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
