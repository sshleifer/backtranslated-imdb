Will you all please miss Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what comes to your mind! The guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE! Sure, the acting is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, make-up is not the best you'll ever see. But it's not the worst, if you want to see it, watch Zombie Nation with its raccoon zombies. <br /> <br /> This is pure, old-fashioned guerrilla filmmaking! Todd is an absolute pro and a nice guy all around. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems to be far-fetched. But hey, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and make the remake of it, to which he would go. If someone has ever tried to make a movie, they know it's a feat in itself.
