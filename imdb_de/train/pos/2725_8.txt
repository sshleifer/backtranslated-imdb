"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks from the famous novel by Truman Capote, deals with the brutal and pointless murder of a family of four by a pair of luckless criminals. The film is characterized by a character study of the murderers, in particular by the trigger Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast contains few recognizable names, but they bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellently suited as two criminals with different personalities. They play effortlessly against each other, while Blake also has the opportunity to explore the peculiarities of his character. The rest of the cast is just average and should not be mentioned further. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his screenplay and directing. In my opinion, both were excellent, even though the script in the late stages miscalculated with some ill-advised narratives. The Oscar-nominated cinematography of Conrad Hall is just as first-class as the editing. Noteworthy is also the jazzy score by Quincy Jones, who secured the last of the four Oscar nominations of the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other thrillers, it does not film violence. Brooks turns the killers into miserable characters rather than totally condemning them. Whether you agree with this feeling or not, the film offers an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are treated.
