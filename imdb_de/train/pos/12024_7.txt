The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you do not have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest disadvantage. It would have been nice to include some of the original characters in the new story and see how their lives have evolved. Sinclair as in the original is excellent and offers the best comic moments of the movie when trying to cope with embarrassing and embarrassing situations, but the minor cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth makes a brave attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
