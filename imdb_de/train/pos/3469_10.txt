This is one of the few films released about a "what if" situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear them talking and remembering all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. I really believe that there is a very good possibility that, as the movie suggests, and they actually have made peace with each other. These are good memories for any fan he can hold to, and asking what happened between them would be selfish. What an amazing movie that was. The comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful. Believing that they were together to pull things together in this way is a reassuring thought to the people who wish they could clear the air with someone they did not come to. Seeing John as such a caring, relaxed character was refreshing when he heard all the garbage spoken about him ...
