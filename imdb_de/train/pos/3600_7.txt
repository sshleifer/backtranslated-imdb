At first glance, I expected this movie to be shitty because I thought the plot was so overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previous published comments, I agree that the feminist role in this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerated her position as a woman. It's as if Guzman were portrayed as someone with a spine, unlike her classmates. So I was surprised by the story, I found it pretty good, except for the foreseeable end. Maybe it would have been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist, so that the viewer is a little more surprised. So she put her character away. I can not really explain why, but especially in the love scenes she has convinced me. It just looked real, I think. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 out of 10 points just for the boring last half hour.
