Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anybody else on earth. Gypo and his Irish fellow citizens live in Ireland in the 1920s and are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive British. A special rebel, who was sought by the English for murder, secretly returns to the city. He believes that he can trust his friend Gypo, but the reward of Â£ 20 proves too tempting. Gypo lets his friend kill and sinks into despair and intoxication. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Immediately, Gypo, whose money is burning a hole in his pocket, is the prime suspect, but those who are his friends do not want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in action but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotional films. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can fully understand his motivations. We also understand his sad character and there is a lot of sympathy for him. The script is also very exciting. It's the kind of tension we're pretty sure we know how it's going to end, so we have to clench our teeth and keep up. The spectacle is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who starred in many Ford films, has probably shown his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). Every other actor in the movie deserves his praise. In addition to a fantastic script and drama, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the dark side of Ford. In its mood as well as in its themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite films from Ford, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); In this respect, it is similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940). 10/10.
