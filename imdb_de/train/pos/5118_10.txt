******** spoiler - beware ******** <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have seen it countless times - and usually I find something new about every visit. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy working-class workers are not rich people who live either in LA or in New York. Well, it's true, except for Pam. Travolta plays Bud, a small-town Texas boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And at that moment, Travolta played in good dramatic films like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical villains / good guys in big budget movies. This is a really good movie - the mechanical bull riding competition and the two-stage dancing may be stupid, but you have to enjoy what it is. Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with Slutty Brilliance) - and soon after they are married and live in their dream trailer. Their relationship, however, becomes a real battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. However, in modern times, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? He can do his dangerous job during the day and ride the mechanical bull at night - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck and also the mechanical bulls. So where is Bud? When Sissy claims her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star - a real bull rider - Wes (wonderfully greasy played by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy break up. Sissy gets together with Wes, who abuses her. Bud goes on to become the boy toy of Pam, a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and everything that goes with it. Sissy walks past the trailer to tidy it up - Pam does not do that. She writes a make-up letter to Bud, but the evil Pam tears it up and claims recognition for Sissy's housework. Bud's uncle Bob tragically dies at work when he makes strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance for reconciliation, but are too stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull riding takes place at Gilley's, and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud does not love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys, but you would not know that the urban cowboy Bud saves the day and recovers the woman he loves. Of course, you may wonder why Bud and Sissy go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Maybe that contributed to her bad marriage. Or why Bud did not stay with Pam - she was not so bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie who always tried to separate them: Marshall says to Bud: "She {Sissy} rides this bull better than you!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is making a bit of fun - and to say, Bonnie Raitt is not on stage!
