I picked this up in the box 'Danger After Dark' and just saw it because of my interest in the Hyde and Gackt show. I expected a mad horror film that was a huge gore-fest and very poor dialogues. That's what it would have been if it had been done in America. Instead, I found myself fascinated by the good evolution of the characters and the way Sho (Gackt) evolves as a person through the film. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, as they are not professional actors, and the director has done a wonderful job with all this. By the way, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film in which I have seen him is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada. In this movie he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, lush and hyperactive and serves with his antics as a kind of comic relief. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island that killed without thinking about it. So watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him, because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. That Hyde's character is a vampire who is almost a background fact with what really is important, and you will love the final scene. It is a really moving picture in some places, photography is really well done. It's definitely something to pick up next time you're at Blockbuster.
