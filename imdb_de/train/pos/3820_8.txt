This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves with her little son Jun from Seoul to Milyang to start over after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, she opens a piano school, but also has the desire to own land with the insurance money she received from her death. When it came to the movie, it would probably have been like a Hollywood movie in which she fell in love with a local man and was happy with her son in her new home. But that's not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, allegedly because she is known to have cash from the settlement. The process of mourning, attempts to continue, to free her conscience from guilt, is all admirable, and the leading actress is magnificent. The only downside, and it must be said that this is a depressing movie. You must know that it goes in. They want Shin-ae to pervade their grief and find some luck. Again, it's not about Hollywood, but about Korea, and in Korean cinema, especially in drama, they do not hit. Life is what happened to you. Great acting, but sometimes a difficult movie to watch, due to the events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do that.
