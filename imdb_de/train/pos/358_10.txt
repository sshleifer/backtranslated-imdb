The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and love that help people who are deeply affected by the struggles of life. Each character had an element of the color purple in it. The film touches love, lost, hope, hate and triumph. Whether it was Celie who has experienced hell and lost her sister, and Shug comes into her life to show her love again. Her stubbornness was good and bad, and even Nettie had her emptiness and hardship through the movie but in the end overwhelmed and that is the sign of a good movie. Good work for all cast and crew.
