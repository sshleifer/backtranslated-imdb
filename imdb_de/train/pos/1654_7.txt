Soap Opera, a married small town (Kay Francis) working at the local kiosk, appears as the lead actress at her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor, who is a ham, a windbag and a womanizer, arrives in the city, she visits him in his room and dreams that he is providing them with insider tips. He pretends his valet is his "manager", making her believe she has everything she needs, but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds the guy and hits him, resulting in an unexpected death of the actor - leading to a murder trial and even more unexpected: A life sentence for his husband. Next, you know she's joined a burlesque show in the hope of one day reaching Broadway and earning enough money to gain her husband's freedom - while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a pretty interesting storyline, well, maybe a bit far-fetched, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all greatly enhanced by the strong, Emotional performance by Kay Francis - she is currently making this film. Here is also the successful acting of Minna Gombell in her role as "approaching nearly forty" older lady who works with the burlesque and befriends with Kay. Worth seeing, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
