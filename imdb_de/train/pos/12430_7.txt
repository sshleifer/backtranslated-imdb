Usually I do not watch action movies because they are usually all very similar. This movie had many stereotyped action movie scenes, but the characters and the originality of the filming requirements made it a lot easier to watch. David Duchovny bowed his normal acting approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie was beautiful and acted great. Great cast all together. A must for people who are bored with the old action movie.
