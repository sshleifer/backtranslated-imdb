I can not believe my eyes when I read a lot of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie with a few ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, funny, crazy, overly violent, but with a minimum of thrill and all the way energy to the core. Loved every single piece of it. I can not remember anything insane like laughter and martial arts. And now the most important thing (at least for me): It is without computer effects. When I watch Hollywood actors stalk "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *") on the screen in modern high-resolution, damned action actions, I understand that every * beep * kid this can - you can customize the wires to the body, add cute PC effects and paste them into the action movie. Here it is different. I do not believe that there will be a dozen physically advanced action stars around the world who can repeat the end of the film brawl or the "Chinese football game". And it's just a little Hong Kong movie that was made just for fun and does not seem like "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> A DVD with English soundtrack is no problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I can not help but mention a very neat play. Some of you may not like it. As far as I'm concerned, it's amazing. Look at the friend of the dragon, who bravely talks to the criminals and suddenly gets a punch on his left side of the head. His expression changes into something strange and he comes to Dragon with a baby expression. And look at the threatening size of his mouth - it's almost from ear to ear when he makes faces. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people around the world. Many thanks to our Russian industry for releasing classic Jackie Chan movies. His modern ones are, in my humble opinion, much weaker and do not deserve much hype. <br /> <br /> A total of 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre. Thank you for your attention.
