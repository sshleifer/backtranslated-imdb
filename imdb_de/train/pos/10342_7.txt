Melvyn Douglas once again gives a brilliant performance in which he plays the role of a detective who can not put love before duty and adventure, and the warmly handsome Joan Blondell (who, as one critic suggested, was not illiterate) wrote a novel about her early life) is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering sweetheart. It's almost a screwball comedy, almost a Thin Man movie, almost a series, I suppose, that did not quite make a sequel. While not reaching classic status, it has all the ingredients for 85 minutes of fun with an episodic but pacey script, fine character cast and a direction that moves everything fast enough that you almost do not notice the Williams (Douglas) is not straight Columbo, when it comes to finding. I wish there were more such films.
