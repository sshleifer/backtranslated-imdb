I saw it last night as a pure TV movie, just by chance. The cover text for the film says something about mother staying with the daughter and taking a romantic journey. When I agreed that the carpenter works at a new Conservatory played by Daniel Craig, the plan was immediately obvious. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the carpenter's love of the mother of the same name is also the daughter's friend. So there are problems with brewing and not too many surprises. But I caught Anne Reid's captivating performance and was thrilled. The director leaves much room to stare in mirrors and adjust scarves when she radiates sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Should not older women's bodies be hushed up? Not here and we get a delicious resurgence in the mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she made (SPOILER!) After discovering that her daughter's suspicions are confirmed that something is going on here, but that could be me. With their waves of Pre-Raph curls, I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face made the confrontations more suitable for me. Bradshaw has a rounder, happier face that does not carry the rage that develops in the course of the movie. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If Mother's farewells are so indifferent to shame, we might be able to see some close-up of the farewell hunters and learn about their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she is a recently-widowed widow who went to the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of compassion. For a movie that is so full of emotions (and be warned, it's like opening champagne, you never get the lid back), the end is a cold contradiction.
