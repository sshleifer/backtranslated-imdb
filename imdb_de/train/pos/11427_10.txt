I loved this movie because, in my opinion, it captured me as perfectly as I imagined life in French colonial Africa, as it must have been in the '50s ("my" generation). But I was really excited about his quiet step and the glorious ending. Within the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to focus intensely on what happens. I've never been so impressed with the "closing" of a movie. I remember that I "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch!
