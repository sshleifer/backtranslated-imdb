Michelle Rodrigez was born for this film when I saw her for the first time in Fast and the Furious. You could tell she was a tough woman. With this film, she has not only proven her acting, she is not afraid and hard as she should be in this film. She is rather a bad girl and I like that about her. This film is about a disturbed girl who lives his life as a little boy and is in constant trouble with school and family. When she's interested in her brothers, who train to be boxers, she decides to pursue her love of combat and asks her brother coach to train her. Even if they do not believe that they have the potential, they are shown to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow in the end but was done well. It shows that people can do anything, even if they do not believe you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
