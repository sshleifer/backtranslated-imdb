Let me start by saying that I'm a big Carrey fan. Although I have to admit that I have not seen all of his films * cough * the magical * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasing. None of the other reviews really focused on how cheesy it is towards the end. I do not know what the authors thought. Somehow I could not help but feel that this movie was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Steve Correl of The Daily Show is HILARIOUS and the rest of the cast. Take a look at Bruce Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey or just want to see a light-hearted (weird, soft piano music) jollity.
