An excellent family movie ... there's a lot to think about ... There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it's so ... real ... such things could happen in every life. And do not forget to act - it's just great! Look at Frankie and you'll know what I was thinking about ... This picture is a real look!
