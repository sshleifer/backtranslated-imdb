The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was that he was one of the top 100 AFI critics. For a Top 100, this is not a very popular movie; I actually had to look hard for a copy, I got the DVD version for about half the price. Surprisingly, it was only rated M15 + (the uncut version). I doubt many will notice this review (more like a comment), so I'll keep it short. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest films I have ever seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic films (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the movie that I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and it's an emotionally confusing movie. <br /> <br /> The shooting and acting were very good and so are the larger than life characters that make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a "cowboy" from Texas, who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled Conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and of course they become friends visiting the usual escapades. What makes the movie interesting are the two characters that are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, so the audience has a real emotional connection, even though the end is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens when you read the reviews, but it's obvious from the start. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find that the film explores its main themes beautifully and poignantly. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the streets of the city, the dilapidated houses). Most characters of the movie exist beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc), but you can not resist liking them. Joe Buck is so popular because he is so naive and optimistic, while later in the movie we feel sorry for Ratso. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was rated so highly because it was certainly very groundbreaking his time. At the time (and now) it was definitely not a typical movie (pretty art-house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by weary Westerns, musicals and dramas, a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy appears. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that I liked the movie very much. The imagery conveys a dreamlike quality. I especially liked the scene at the party, the music, pictures, etc. remain in the memory for a long time. But as a movie for entertainment reasons, it lacked a bit (not really my movie style) of thrill. This is a movie to be enjoyed and appreciated, not a cheap action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I would hardly qualify for the analysis of this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, though this still does not seem relevant to the story. He is a happy young stallion who suppresses his dark memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, though I do not know where they got the idea from. The subject of homosexuality in general is more than touched on in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly technically one of the best films of the decade (he has more of a feel of the 70s than a sense of the 60s) and revolutionary for his time, as he touches topics few other films dared to do , While it has a simple, sentimental history (disguised by a hard edge), the beauty of the film lies in its strange, often psychedelic sequences.
