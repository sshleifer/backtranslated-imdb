Actually, I really liked this movie very much. Not because of his conspiracy, acting, jokes, no. I liked it because it's one of the worst movies ever made. It's so lame, so bad, it's terribly funny. Some jokes are actually cool, but the rest makes me ask for the scriptwriter for unemployment. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll laughing to the floor (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
