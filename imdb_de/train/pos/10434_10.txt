the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime way and definitely touching your heart. A rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions, and the pain of separation. The joy of seeing your loved one is unique and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have prepared eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the film a sheer joy and love of prestige. A must for those who believe in true love. By far the most romantic (at least one) movie of all time.
