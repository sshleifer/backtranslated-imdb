I remember Parker Posey talking about "As The World Turns" before she became the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a top actress. In this film with a side cast, Omar Townsend is also included as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street and aspires to become a teacher. The understudy is a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family member as Judy, the librarian who is old-fashioned, dedicated and menopausal. Posey as Mary learns that she must grow up and mature. Losing her clerical position as a librarian makes her realize how much she misses her as a place in her life. Maria's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City, before being worshiped by yuppies. This movie is pretty good for an independent and I've enjoyed Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters in other films.
