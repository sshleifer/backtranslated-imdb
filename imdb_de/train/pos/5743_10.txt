I loved this movie! It was all I could do to keep from falling into tears, but it's really uplifting. I was impressed by the performance of Ray Liotta, but above all the talent of Tom Hulce, who represents Ray's twin brother, who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, knows no self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it !!
