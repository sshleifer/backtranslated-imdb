Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, delivers high-profile martial arts action in this exciting Hong Kong movie, proving that she, like her late brother Brandon, is a true chip of the old block. There's high-tech stunts to be found in this fast-paced movie, and the creators of the Bond films should take a look at spicing up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure, with plenty of innovative stuff with something new and something to offer becomes original second unit to strengthen the already high action content of "AND NOW, YOU'RE DEAD". When you see a movie as fast and entertaining as this one, you begin to wonder how the cinema itself could survive before the martial arts genre was created. I really believe that movies in general and action movies in particular only made the time until the first movie Kung Fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring, Shannon does not abandon the family name here. Although there are several enjoyable performances in this film (Michel Wong), you will remember Shannon Lee, whom you will truly remember as Spectacular Performance as Mandy the Hitgirl Supreme. Well, you can get away and whistle your fights!
