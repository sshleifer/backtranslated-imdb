John Waters gave us a really enjoyable movie. This is certainly not without its shocking, water addictive moments, but it's tamer than its older cult material like Pink Flamingoes. "Pecker" goes back to John's early mainstream stage, reminding the viewer of the same kind of humor that was in "polyester". All in all a really funny comedy with great moments!
