Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is a good movie, but as you may have seen on video, they might end up having a party and probably end the movie with the party no ghosts or anything, but on the original (live TV) when they celebrate, but before I say more than Ben Obi-Wan dies in the Imperial Ship or Death Star, they see him disappear and Yoda dies either in old age or in the inner disease. But because Luke Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker ) when everyone celebrates at the end, when Luke or somebody keeps the ghosts from Ben and Yoda Starring stands with him and smiles while another ghost appears, his Darth Vader appears, but not as A Sith like the old, usual man from him and started smiling with Ben and Yoda I think that made the end of the movie a little interesting. But the producers or anybody should get a ghost from Padme and Mace Windu and other Jedis who were killed with Younglings Under There arms in th e back ground
