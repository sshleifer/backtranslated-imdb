Well, "Wayne's World" is long gone and years since then have been tough on snl off-shoot movies. From such cinematic innards as "It's Pat" to the 80-minute yawning "A Night at the Roxbury", many have undoubtedly lost faith that any other Snl sketch ever makes a successful transition to the canvas. Well, do not worry, not because Tim Meadows comes in spades. The well-written storyline keeps the audience interested until the end, and while remaining faithful to the Leon Phelps figure introduced in the five-minute sketch, allows the plot to develop the character. The humor (which consists mainly of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than any movie I've had lately. It's a great time if you do not want to take yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen from "Saved by the Bell" is famous, performs in the movie and looks amazing. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, who relived his colt 45 days, gives the film a touch of class. and for those who are mindless movie quotes like myself, this movie will be excellently quoted as saying, "Oh, it's a lady!"
