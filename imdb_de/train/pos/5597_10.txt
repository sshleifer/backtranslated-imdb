"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski plays as Trelkovsky, a timid file officer living in Paris who answers an advertisement for a flat just to find it. The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her at the hospital, where he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky moves in immediately, when the previous tenant dies and is quite pleased found such a nice apartment. His luck will soon be replaced by paranoia waves, as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seemingly try to get Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie creates a surreal movie atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Many brilliant moments, such as the classic scene in which Trelkovsky discovers the previous guest's tooth in a hole in the wall, or the fever dream in which he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls with hieroglyphs. The photography by Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. "The Tenant" is a neglected gem. It can be hard to track, but it's worth more than that.
