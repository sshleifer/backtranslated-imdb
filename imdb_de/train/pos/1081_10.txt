One of the great classic comedies. No slapstick comedy, no heavy drama. A funny, satirical movie, a buyer guards the guide to a new home. <br /> <br /> With great characters that Cary Grant believes are looking for him to build a dream home br /> <br /> A great view of life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
