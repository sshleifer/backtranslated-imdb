Paulie sounds like saccharine, lachrymosis, and sentimental garbage you might ever find, but it's actually a lot better than you might expect. The plot's stupidity could easily have set the tone for the entire movie, but in most other sections the film is charming. <br /> <br /> If you ask yourself, Paulie is a parrot. Purchased for a little girl with speaking difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder while studying language therapy and eventually becomes a highly intelligent speaker. Paulie, however, is sent away by the little girl's mother, and he spends the rest of the movie coming from NYC to LA to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> Why does that sound so awful? Film succeeds relatively well? First, there are some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and more importantly) it has the courage to embrace its ridiculous premise and to tell a truly moving, often humorous story without worrying too much about the apparent flaws in the plot. Third, there are several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a cunning rogue, Gena Rowlands as a friendly old lady and Cheech Marin (yes, the dope smoking Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is a solid entertainment for kids of all ages.
