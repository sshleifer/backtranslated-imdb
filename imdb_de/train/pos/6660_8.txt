"Gandhi as husband and father?" was always discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story few would have known about such details. Surely a glimpse of Gandhi's private life. <br /> <br /> Overall I liked the movie for story and movie. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah have all done a good job. Most scenes in the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers ... a commendable work. Traditional Indian folk music as background music during certain parts of the film gives a good feel to the action. <br /> <br /> What I did not really like was the narrative style. In several places I found the sound overdramatized. <br /> <br /> Overall good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as a must-watch-once. 8.10
