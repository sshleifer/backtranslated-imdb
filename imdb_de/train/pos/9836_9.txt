Although it's not as scary as its classic cult predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I like it better. This is due to its faster tempo, the better settings and the cool sound of the 80s. It's full of action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. The zombies do not look as bad as in ZOMBI 2, but look good anyway. It was done pretty well, but it definitely has its share of cheese making; For example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. Some are Braindead while others say weird lines, but who can expect consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There is even a flying zombie head! How radical is that? An absolute must for Gorehounds and Zombie fans. it would probably also satisfy most fans of action movies. Take a look at Zombi 4 as well.
