The thought that Sarah Silverman had her own show worried me first. The movies she appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a little bit outlandish. However, I was very surprised that their true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem. I could possibly equate her with Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank's Supporting Actor. The character of her sister is good; Sometimes funny, but ultimately meant not stealing Sarah's show. The rest of the cast, however, is extremely below average in comparison. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad that Comedy Central gave Sarah the chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
