"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colored film by Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly, it is not samurai, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It's in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the residents are homeless drunkards, beggars, vagabonds, maltreated women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and the environment for the color scheme, but in fact they are very sad stories, some of which are heartbreaking. Personally, I like the touching story of the boy and his father, who dream and build their own house. the story of the retarded boy who believes he is flying a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman who was abused by her stepfather. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden? The Way of Life")
