"It was not me! It was, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he is confronted with being with Sally. I've used this line dozens of times over the years (though no one believed it yet). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best movies of all time for fun and unbelievable. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan's role, so much so that in 1978 he was the same character as "Malibu Beach" (though not nearly as much screen time) Turd! "is another line for eternity." This classic movie was definitely worth the ticket price.
