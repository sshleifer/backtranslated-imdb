Man, this is a hard DVD to come by. I could only find it in Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Oh well. Not so much because it's a masterpiece of filmmaking, though it was directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com are "Robert," but the DVD credits list is Curt), or because there are some familiar characters from other murder secrets has - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my decades of curiosity about the movie is finally satisfied. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) was confessed by his strange wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to him and he politely invites her to join the musical review. She accepts a little grim. The mopey bartender looks at both when leaving. <br /> <br /> At the show, the stormy star notices that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and breaks in front of the stage in rage. The drummer of the band, Cook, looks at the silent lady, but receives no answer. Curtis brings the woman to her home and asks her name, but she does not give it and does not want to know his. If she had been a Longfellow fan, she would have said something about ships passing by at night. Okay, Curtis goes home to find out that his wife was murdered in his absence. Police chief Gomez hands him over to the prosecutor. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady nobody else seems to remember - not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver ("Al Alp"), not the drummer - and since the lady itself is gone, it is impossible to find it. <br /> <br /> Curtis is convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez has considered and decided that she is probably innocent because no one with a brain would invent such a stupid story. He joins Curtis' loving secretary, Ella Raines, to investigate the case informally. <br /> <br /> You visit the alleged witnesses again. The ominous bartender may accidentally get run over by a car, so he is not in the picture. The spirited Latina has left because the show was closed and she is not cooperative and does not know the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook Jr. is strangled by the real killer, but only in a scene where he beats the drums of an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face takes on an expression that does not suggest an intense focus, but rather a monstrous, orgasmic madness. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gaping, his hammering growling. I laughed aloud. No one has a different performance than usual, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. However, the best performance is probably achieved by Franchot Tone. He is the true murderer and fakes his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even if he faints, he is pretty. I do not know how to say it exactly, but Tone seems to be thinking and playing his part. Alan Curtis is an innocent engineer on the Kelvin scale near zero and belongs in a B-picture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it's classic. It's really your basic murder mystery of Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man is run over and his hat pulls into a gutter, around which water runs. His use of shadows is quietly effective. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I got it.
