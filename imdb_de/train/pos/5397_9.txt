Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri directed by Hideo Gosha - with Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya - NAkadei (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) is one of the best Chambara films out there. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo)) who works for Nakadei, who wants to become Tagmio. Okada, who is the "cleaner" for Nakadei, is treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes what he really is for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there is so much more in this movie - every fan of Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Heaven's Punishment)
