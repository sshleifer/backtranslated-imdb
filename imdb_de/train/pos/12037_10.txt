The Woman In Black was a British TV movie first aired on the BBC's Christmave Eve in '89 and again in '92. I believe that it made a round on American television at A & E. It was released on VHS in the UK in the early 1990s, but was no longer in print. A US company later released it on DVD, but this version is also sold out. According to the book's author's website, the rights to the film are now owned by another person that is no longer published and that unofficial bootlegs are being sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I recently heard of a movie on a message board and had to watch it. I found a copy on ebay for about $ 28. It's certainly a counterfeit of a Far Eastern salesman, even though the DVD says "Made in Canada, ha ha." But it's a good copy, and you can not really blame the bootleg labels because they're rare, out of print, and in Litigation lost material. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It's a 1920's piece, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of the time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. In most cases, the movie is very restrained but effective and scary. There is no self-indulgent blood pressure, violence or much more in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely calming moments. It's a cool ghost style in a classic style. The movie itself looks like it was made in the 1930s, except for the color. Without all the modern horror movies, I'm afraid, this movie is just a lost gem. For me, it's one of my favorites of all time.
