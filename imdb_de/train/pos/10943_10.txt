I have to choose that 10 out of 10 odds for the rare chance that she will see this review by accident, feel sorry for me, take me to Hollywood and involve me in her freaky / funny world. But in all seriousness it was good. Obviously, feet are found in the first episode, but the Silverman craze goes all the way. It's not loud laughter like a comedy, but that's a good thing, too much has a laugh path, and this would not be the right choice when you laugh, it's for the audience to hear its inside joker laugh at the absurdity of everything. I can easily understand this as the bizarro Drew Carey Show with its funny characters and incredibly strong central characters. It is definitely worthwhile to look forward to the following episodes. A very good chance from the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
