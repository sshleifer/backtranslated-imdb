This movie is one of my favorites. It's a genre mix with ingredients from the action / horror / romance / comedy genre. Some of the special effects appear outdated compared to modern standards. This little mistake is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The visuals are nice too. The action is great and no surprise. It's from Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. The humor sometimes looks a bit silly, but in a good way. Somehow, this movie can balance the different moods and stays fine. Absolutely recommended
