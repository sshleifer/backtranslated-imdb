I looked through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that the film hit Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969 for the best picture. However, after actually seeing him, I am no longer surprised. It was well ahead of its time in terms of style, cinematography and the use of flashbacks to develop the character of Joe Buck. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me is the depth of the character of Joe Buck short movie. I think Voight captured the naivety and wickedness when provoked. The two scenes that really caught my eye were when he got the blowjob in the theater and when the older man asked him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if he really has or will do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take on this role. Otherwise, he may have been written after the graduate. However, for a good reason, this was an all-time great.
