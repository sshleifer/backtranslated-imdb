Babyface - The infamous Barbara Stanwyck movie sequence where the local professor tells her that she has power - he tries to get her to read Nietzche - she says, books would never do her good She's become a local Politicians and others go. Finally she has enough and moves to the big city. We follow their trail of men on the ladder of success in an international bank. The dialogue is pretty naughty for the time being and it was one of the last two films to come out of the self-inflicted Hollywood production code. Look for a cameo appearance of a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims. Part of the Forbidden Hollywood Collection - I looked at the enhanced version - the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting movie and forerunners of Femme Fatale's future role, which Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir. B +
