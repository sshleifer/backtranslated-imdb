This is not as violent as I expected, making the violent scenes all the more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are many twists and turns, as well as backstitching and double crossings all the way through the film making it difficult to know which side a particular character is on. <br /> <br /> The storyline is step by step with good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting insight into how the Triad gang works, which it follows. <br /> <br /> The violence when it comes to it is brutal, no weapons or martial arts scenes with special effects, this is credible to the violence in the face and for all dialogues one must never forget that the triad is a violent criminal organization is. <br /> <br /> The end is surprising, but consistently consistent and credible.
