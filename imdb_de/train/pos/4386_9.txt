This is a strong movie. When I saw it for the first time, the Scottish accents made it hard to understand much, ruining the viewing experience. I gave it up, then bought the DVD, used the English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this movie and discovered how good it is. It is excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen picture makes it partly spectacular, with a wonderful, rough landscape and the story that reminded me of Braveheart, a story that tells the good against evil. Here it is Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both are doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Few actors seem as scornful as Roth. Man, you really want to beat this guy with his arrogant, irritating puss. (He is so evil and mean that the sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man and a solid hero figure, as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as a female lead. The movie attracts you and makes you totally involved, so willing to have an emotional experience when you look at it.
