Sunday would not be an action-less Sunday, and if you want an intense fight, contact Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here he plays a sniper in the jungle, the rebels and drug addicts pursues. Life is a bitch, so he gets a green office guy (Billy Zane) who will help with the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stunk anaconda. he does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be a bit long - but who wants to walk through the jungle a lot, is good. tense action when the time is right.
