This best shows how I believe that Jesus really was like that. Most films show that Jesus is feminine, lobotomized or tortured. This Jesus laughed, played and was serious when needed. This is the kind of Jesus people might be drawn to, not the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took some liberties and tried to "fill in the gaps". But the fillers did not seem impossible or even unlikely. One thing I could possibly argue was that it never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film shows that the Romans were the main culprit of the death of Jesus, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea) , <br /> <br /> it seemed the movie was well researched. One example was the spontaneous commentary on a teen called "Mark." it is believed that Mark (or John Mark) was the boy referred to in the garden of Gethsemane, whose coat had been taken off and walked naked (Mark 14:51). I feel that they have tried to make the movie as accurate as possible (even mentally).
