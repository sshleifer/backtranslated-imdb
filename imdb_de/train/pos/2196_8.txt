So what about those 10 missing minutes that were so horrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were in the movie production code for three years ... Barbara Stanwyck had originally played, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity" with Stanwyck and his TV series "My Three Sons". Look out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the too-fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who is spicing up almost every tape-recorded movie. Of course he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Maggie's buddy Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend of "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High" meets Maggie, the tourist, a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses her boat as she leaves the harbor and gets tangled up with the soldier. 20-year-old Quinn has a small scene in the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid get together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good songs from Lamour. Good (but short) drama performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise, helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others complained about how bad it was, it was not so horrible and even a bit exotic, because in the first half of the movie you can hear the fake restaurant in Central America.
