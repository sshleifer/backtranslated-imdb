I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it. When a widowed father of two interrupts the sleep of his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are not torn between believing in him or her. As the terrible events of this story unfold, we learn a lot about the Father, about his two sons, and about their fate. With shocking twist following a shocking twist, this movie never lets a break in the storyline. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are those of his older son Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary, and his younger son Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time, and you'll want to see this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the storyline. I give this movie a 9/10.
