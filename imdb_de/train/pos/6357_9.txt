I thought that was a very entertaining little children's movie that was actually meant for adults with lots of jokes and humor that only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kids, but only a few. Otherwise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) makes so many jokes that you can not compete, from sexual to cultural, to insider Hollywood, to races. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks good on DVD. The little girl "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) here is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of the little people here are fun. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasing, so the narrative continues to lift the movie. His rhymes are fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but on DVD it was much better. I've seen it three times and it got better every time.
