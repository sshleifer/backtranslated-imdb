If you are open minded enough to enjoy Barber Shop you will like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then give it the current score it has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for those who want to watch movies outside their own race. It's tempting, lifelike, on two or three occasions you lose the connection between the scenes, but often, especially at the end, you have one or two tears in your eyes, and this is because it reflects so often what life can be like , <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone who goes beyond the traditional American movie.
