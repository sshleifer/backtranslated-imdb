Damn, I've seen this movie at least 4 times now and I'm still not bored watching it. <br /> <br /> The visuals are so good and along with the music that fits absolutely fantastically and perfectly This movie is amazing for me. <br /> <br /> The CGIs are pretty bad in my opinion, but the overall visuals with the black and white feel and the totally sterile interiors were simple ... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> Although the film had small defects, such as: Sometimes I thought the movie was too slow, but I do not mean the scenic aspects, I totally loved them. <br /> <br /> Also, I was very often distracted by the totally complex story. Like when he's in the underground bunker thing of the Digicorps, where all their data is stored, and has that conversation with that guy down there ... but that can only be me: D And the end could have somehow been indicated make the get-back true-memory part a bit longer and "louder", but without all these shortcomings, the movie would have been so good that I would never have given it up again. ,
