There is a story, but essentially, the world of this movie starts in chaos and comes to an order within ten minutes. It is a celebration of life and an optimistic statement of objective truth good. Along an axis that has not yet been explored in the cinema, this film should be taught in every high school. <br /> <br /> * CHIASMUS *
