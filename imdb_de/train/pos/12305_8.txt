I was not sure what to expect with this, outside the consistent positive reviews I read. It turned out that I could never have imagined this film, because he is very close to "The Bride with White Hair" because he is operational and deals with the fantastic. This is a clear line between a farce, a comedy and just a good old fashion ghost story. There's nothing scary about it, that's not the topic, it's mainly a love story about a slumpy guy who meets a nice ghost who gets in trouble with other ghosts. The main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful spirit. This is also happening in ancient China, with wild, crazy Kung Fu exhibitions and a journey to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are definitely top notch. I could see this genre of Chinese films all day because they are very entertaining, great pictures and pretty funny. And I'm looking forward to seeing the first installment of this movie. Highly recommended.
