I remember this film most because it was broadcast on KTLA TV (Chapter 5) every Christmas between the mid and late 1970s. This is mainly because the true story took place on or near Christmas Eve. It has always been a bit disturbing to see the hell this girl goes through because she is the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene in which the young girl drew leeches from her infected leg impressed this young spectator. Not quite the kind of Christmas spirit I was used to at that time. By no means a Rankin bass production.
