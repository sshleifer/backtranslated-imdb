A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret regarding his relationship with paranoia. With a running time of only 74 minutes a lot is going on, but it works. The fear is very subtle, not the fear that seems to populate the latest Asian horror movies. The manner in which "fear" is established is similar to the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly equal. The film does a great job of reconciling a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. I would recommend trying it out if you get a chance.
