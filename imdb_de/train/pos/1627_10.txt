Blond and blonde has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more out of a movie, you're totally unreasonable. It feels like Carry On from the late days, when the series was no longer hot, but still funnier than not. Think of Behind or England and you will not be too far away. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and know for sure that this is not a masterpiece, although they can give me many things that I should like. The cast is energetic, though some of them are not very good; I can not see a few stupid twists in a movie that's almost forgotten, which makes a big difference to everything, so just smile. I really think that blondes and blondes are an ace and I hope you hate me for that.
