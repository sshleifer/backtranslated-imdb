Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate that I came to Gundam and Anime in general. However, after watching his predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I find that Wing Gundam is Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: One aspect that Gundam has long since is to have their characters run into trouble and grow to maturity. This is not the case in Wing. Heero is a top dog at the beginning and in the end he is a top dog. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is a hero in most series. But suddenly the show reveals him and makes him a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has great suit designs. The Gundams are super cool and the Epyon is my favorite. I even think that some of the OZ suit designs are equivalent to the classic Zeon suits. But sweet suit designs do not save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fight scenes that are interspersed with recycled animations, but a flat storyline and character development. Pleasing, but does not move as in previous Gundam outings.
