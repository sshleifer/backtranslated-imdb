Zombie Chronicles is nothing special, it's obviously not an award-winning movie, but it's an entertaining B-movie by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, another entertaining low-budget movie. Acting is as bad as most cheap-produced films, but that makes them more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective, especially with the budget, the Gore is also great and disgusting, the movie is similar to a zombie version of Tales from the tomb, as we get two stories about zombie encounters in the forest, make the stories fun and especially guess the first story. Zombie Chronicles is way better than some low budget zombie movies, if you love low budget B movies or cheap built zombie movies then check out Zombie Chronicles.
