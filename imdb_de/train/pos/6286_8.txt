gone in 60 sec Where did I start, it keeps you in the movie with good action and cool cars. People say it's not a good movie. I do not think it has a few cheesy parts, but which action movie is not. I gave him 8 out of 10 reasons for the action and the comic relief, if you like the rock or face-off - Roy Lindo. I think people sometimes look too far into movies, sometimes you have to sit back and enjoy the movie. which means, when it came to action, it was action pact. if they were trying to make a movie, changing the way movies are made, and trying to win any award, alright? I think they shot the action movie they set out to do. Give her a chance and you will not regret it.
