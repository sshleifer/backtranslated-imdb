I liked the quiet Noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The mood of the environment and the juxtaposition of the old Pol and the idealistic youth had an effect. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; She was a serious and attractive figure. The film had gone completely out of control for me when the deputy mayor started snooping around the mafioso to clear out something that his boss obviously did not want. Junkyard Here, the story became implausible. Something I do not understand: why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter provided information that could overthrow the corrupt judge?
