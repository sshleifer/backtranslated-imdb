OK. I am biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember that they vividly filmed here and for days the wrong snow on the streets. When I go through Shrewsbury, I often see a street or a house, and that reminds me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott's is tall and imposing. A man who considers the smaller ones to be inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most valued works in English. And I do not think there are many cynics who would say that people are not capable of change and salvation. This movie version portrays it all very nicely. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays the role of the English miser with wonderful abilities. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, I would do so urgently. Usually it is available for a low price ... or are you too mean?
