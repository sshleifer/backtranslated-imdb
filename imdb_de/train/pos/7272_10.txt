Before I start, let me tell you how great this stand-up special is when playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut (especially the Red Mountain level). So, while watching this stand-up special, I suggest - no, DEMAND do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia brings his stand to the limit in San Francisco, California. There he makes fun of everyone without apologizing. <br /> <br /> I thank God here that Carlos did not do his thing by using the same joke over and over again. He does a tremendous job, making fun of everyone and at the same time being honest about it; I know a few times that I said after Carlos said a joke, "Damn, this guy is making a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I forgot that I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So there is nothing to complain about this standup special. If you have TiVo or similar, please do yourself a favor and write down this historic lesson.
