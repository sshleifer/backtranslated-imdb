This movie is like Marmit. You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this movie and expect a real movie with decent production values, a good plot, and great characters, you'll hate him. If you go into this movie and expect a slasher on a low budget, you'll probably hate him. <br /> <br /> If you go into this movie and expect to see one of the most confusing characters ever shot in the form of Harry Russo, you'll love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his exaggerated portrayal of the insane, murderous Coke Fiend. <br /> <br /> The special effects are miserable at best, but really, who cares? If you're the kind of person who's ready to watch a movie Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler, you've certainly seen dozens of horror movies filled with blood. With the budget for which this film was made, he would probably have been mediocre, even if they had tried. I would much rather be able to laugh at something disgusting than to be unaffected by the mediocre. <br /> <br /> To sum up, you probably hate this movie, but if you're one of the few who chooses to do it, it'll be the best since bread # 2 was sliced. I hate Marmite.
