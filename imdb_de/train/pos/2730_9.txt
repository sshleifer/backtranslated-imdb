I saw this in the theater on his first release, and it was disturbing at the time, as I'm sure it will still be like this. It was the first part of '68, and this was still going on in cities across America. Recently, there had been a mass murder in my hometown, where I saw what a man had experienced in a shootout. The freshness of this local event in combination with this dramatic, true story made for a very disturbing theater experience. It really brought to life the excellent drama of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on Truman Capote's true event, and the script and direction of Richard Brooks led the Truman event and interpretation to a compelling film adaptation. Music by Quincy Jones effectively scores with his story. I have only seen it a few times since then. It was too real. Almost like being a witness of the crime itself and riding with the killers. I would give here a 9.0 out of a possible 10 points. Today, society is so desensitized that violence and crime appear slow and tame today and can be viewed with less impact. For all over-50s, however, this is a hallmark for the investigation of the criminal psyche.
