A notorious pre-code movie, really the one movie where people insisted that the Hayes code be strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck plays a lead role as a young girl whose father, who sells alcohol, has no problem getting her to the customers. If he dies in an accident, she will be released to the world, knowing that her body can get her what she wants. She goes to New York and climbs up the corporate ladder, one bed after the other. Although obviously no sex is shown, the movie is pretty run down. Unfortunately, after the initial shock level subsides (at about the time Stanwyck screws a wagon inspector so he can travel for free), the movie becomes a little repetitive and boring movie. Stanwyck himself is the only thing that keeps the movie worth going through. As always she is fantastic.
