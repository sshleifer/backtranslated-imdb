This is one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. It was the first Gable Crawford pair that made it clear to MGM and the audience that it was a seething team. The studio has seven more films with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly shows the downward trend of a brother and sister who, after their father lost everything in the stock market crash, have to take care of themselves and work for a living. Life in depression is hard, and soon their attempts to find legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activities. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is great as a celebrity who turns out to be a minor. She is intelligent, complex and believable. It even brings with it the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style. Clark Gable is a rough, masculine and rugged incense stick like the gangster who deals with Crawford's character. In the same year, he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul," securing his position as a male top sex symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford this way Do not miss "Paid" that she did a year ago, which is also one of her best early talkie performances. <br /> <br />
