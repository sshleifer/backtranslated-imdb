This is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. It's by far the best I've seen so far and that represents the current reality in Latin America. Denzel Washinton shows in my opinion the most moving achievements of his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken illuminates the screen for me like no other actor. I would like to have seen more of both. The authentic places are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin American actors in the cast, which makes it all the more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
