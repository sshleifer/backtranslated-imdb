Well, I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors. I think after seeing this movie, they should do more movies together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself in a bit of trouble by dating three women at the same time, but the way he handles it when one comes out the door and the other is just so weird he has done really well in his film and I hope John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role very well and he is so underrated that I am glad that some of his amazing work has been noticed, but he is a really good one Actor . I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
