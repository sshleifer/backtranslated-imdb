Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever designed. To win the money, you have to be SMART. Not only that you have to be brave, athletic, smart, and so on. Not like some lame donkey shows that take place on those days. And yet they only have two seasons of it! Bull .. they have to bring back this show !! <br /> <br /> Although it will be difficult to stop Anderson Cooper from CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was a great show. They never knew who would go when. And it was so much fun to find out the mole itself! It was a show that you could play yourself if you wanted! <br /> <br /> RETURNING THE MOLE !!!! BRING THE MOLE BACK !!!!
