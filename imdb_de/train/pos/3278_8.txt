This is a wonderfully written and well-played psychological drama. It's not really a horror movie, so those looking for The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this movie was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort to be inwardly stable. I also appreciated the absence of dr. Phil Psychobabble or New Age Revisionism. Instead of pursuing an agenda, the filmmakers told the story, told it well, and made the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes are reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and are amazingly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of a good movie on a budget, without big studios, star actors, big directors (this was much better than many of Hitchcock's films), special effects or "clever" twists.
