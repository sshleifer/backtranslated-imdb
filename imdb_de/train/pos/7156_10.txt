Holes is a fantastic movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few Disney-produced movies that are not cheesy. Holes are generally a very cool movie. I wish Disney would take more pictures. Holes is indeed a rare kind of Disney flicker shows that is cool. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean Disney's bad mouth, but most things are aimed at kids and THIS IS OK. Children also earn their entertainment. But Disney is guilty of trying to target the young crowd and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's the kind of movie everyone can see and enjoy at any age, and not just crazy. Really, it's the kind of movie that many young hoods can enjoy as there are characters they can relate to. <br /> <br /> Holes do a good job as a mix of good family entertainment not to be cheesy and a bit on the verge of living. I hope that Disney takes more risks and makes more noticeable stripes like this.
