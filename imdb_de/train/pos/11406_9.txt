This very peculiar backdrop of Wagner's last opera has definitely grown for me. When I saw it for the first time, I was slightly annoyed by the surrealistic images of the films, and I felt that the story was overshadowed by history. However, if you can deal with a lot of researched "gimmicks", you will find that the film manages to capture the very strange, extra-worldly atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments that are especially fine. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never truly understood Kundry's role until I saw Edith Clever portray her. Her performance (a lip-sync pantomime of the voice of Yvonne Minton) is just dazzling from end to end and justifies the hours the movie needs. <br /> <br /> Another reason for this The joy of this film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's spectacular interpretation of Gurnemanz's pivotal role, which Lloyd put to the test at opera houses around the world. I had the privilege of enjoying him many times in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, and the lushness of his voice and the warm paternity of his interpretation of this noble character had to be preserved, as was his performance in the two most important monologues of the Figure, the Good Friday scene and the recounting of the prophecy in Act 1. The version I saw was a videotape made for America, and so there were subtitles that unfortunately could not be left out. This is particularly regrettable because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely Christian interpretation of a film that already imposes the interpretation level of the opera. This seemed completely contradictory to me both in contradiction to Wagner's clear avoidance of Christianity and his very conscious attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of history. (See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it almost impossible to refrain from watching a movie with subtitles on it, and strongly recommend that subtitles can be rotated in DVD versions if you do not know the opera , read the libretto carefully before. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there's a lot in the movie that I do not like and I want to have done it as fast as I have ... but it's in my estimation over the years Ever since I saw it for the first time, it has risen steadily, and I always enjoy enjoying it. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTES CONTAINING A SPOILER: A good example would be Kundry's famous line: "I saw him ... him ... and laughed." This is translated in the subtitles for reasons that escape me, as "I have seen the face of the Savior". It is particularly irritating for me because throughout the whole libretto Wagner deliberately and carefully refers to this invisible character, which must NOT be THE BIBLIC Jesus, as "the Savior", ie the German for "The Healer" - an indication of the wound Amfortas and all wounds and diseases and the need for healing.
