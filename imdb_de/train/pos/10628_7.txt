Despite the occasionally stilted acting and the "seen-before-everything" story, this is a pretty addictive movie. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, the scenes with the demon are actually quite scary, some of the visual effects are superb and best, no ridiculously sick humor that could distract the movie because too many (would-be) Horror movies are now in them. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this is not the best movie ever made, but it actually attracts you and at least makes an attempt at character development. <br /> <br /> I was glad that I was I saw it
