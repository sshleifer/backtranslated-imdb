There are too many new styles of sitcom, but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with audience and indoor set. This 70s show is a great example. Nobody really heard anything from Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp when the program aired, and much less did the teenagers play Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests). I wish Topher would stay around because the show started about his character Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember, when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. Actors were never known to us, which is a good thing because a celebrity performer can ruin them. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played Don's girlfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as Original Laurie, the replacement could not agree with her and I'm sorry. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but popular character of Steven Hyde. I loved seeing Tanya Roberts next to Charlie's Angels. I loved that Brooke Shields played Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before going to Broadway. This show was a treat with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer even though two of their performers are going, but I hope they will not stay away too long. I wish the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show Third Rock by The Sun, more successful on Fox than on NBC, where their show was sabotaged. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they will create more such shows in the future.
