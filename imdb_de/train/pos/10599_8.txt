SPOILER Many different comedy series have already experimented with the idea of ​​obscure independence these days. In an early episode of the cartoon "Family Guy," the Griffin family finds that their homeland is an independent nation in the United States of America, and the story continues from there. Already in 1949 Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little movie based on the same idea. <br /> <br /> After a kid's prank, the inhabitants of Pimlico discover a small fortune treasure. The investigation shows that the small area is a small foothold of the long-lost state of Burgundy. After leaving London and the rest of the UK, the residents of the small street experience the joys and problems of being an independent state. This story is based on a time when the rationing was still in use brilliantly told and equally inspiring. With performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the film features some of the best actors of their generation. These actors are also supported by a great little script with some cracking lines. Even though she is over 50 years old, the story feels surprisingly fresh and always entertaining. <br/> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the best exporters of British films ever. For movies like "Passport to Pimlico", it's not hard to understand why. Amusing from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth seeing.
