Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams play the lead role in the action / thriller written by suspense master Wes Craven himself. The whole movie starts with some trouble at Lux Atlantic, a Miami hotel. The problem is resolved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. Then she goes to the airport and there begins the trouble. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they get on the plane and crazy enough Rippner and Reisert sit side by side. In the next half hour Lisa is terrorized by Rippner, tormented and scared. I will not reveal anything. Then we make our way where Jack chases Lisa in the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her dad is well and Rippner is crazy enough. Throughout the scene, there is almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity. Overall, at the end of about 25 minutes of intense action are announced. <br /> <br /> The film was not only intense, it also had a great storyline. Like I said, I will not reveal anything because it's so shocking and exciting and a little worrying. And the acting of every single character in the film, even those without lines, were all perfect. It was amazing. Everything was great in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the make-up, the direction, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the master of suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must and definitely worth spending money on. You could watch this movie over and over and over and it would never get boring. Red eye I have to say it's better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language < br /> <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, frightening scenes, annoying content
