I'm waiting for each new episode, each with anticipation! The new look of Sci-Fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a miracle that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season 9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season because I love his dry joke as much as his tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters give the show its own uniqueness, which makes it a winner season after season. They cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. Plus, you need a bigger role for the Asgard - they're just too cool.
