This is by far one of the better-made films and has not disappointed me at all. The soundtrack along with the finely shot handcraper work was exquisite. There are always chances that one movie may not hold its belief as well as another, but I felt that the rhythm of the picture and the timing were excellent. Dakota Fanning quickly becomes an integral part of the film, which requires a child with an old soul personality, and she has never disappointed me with her talent. Mr. Washington, and of course Christopher Walken, both challenge to show the dark side of humanity trying to approach the light.
