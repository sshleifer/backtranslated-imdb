The second step to making a movie out of it would be great !! I was also surprised by the story and the characters that were built in this game. I've played it over and over again (over 20 times) to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eats your heart !! This should be done in a movie !!!!! If anyone out there needs help to start a petition to make this a movie, please contact me. I would like to help with this project every day. The graphics are great for PS1 and let you forget that it's mostly PS1. The variety of side quests makes it different with each game.
