he is the epitome of the narcissist and manipulator; In this case, the lawyer (and murderer) Tom Capano is represented. Kathryn Morris is likeable as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but in the beginning the victim is a bit too much. We apologize for the situation but are disgusted at the same time after seeing his victims from several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where she actually gets help with her self-esteem issues, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed. Pretty hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (awarded) as Capano's mother. All in all, it's an interesting story because it's based on a real murder and you should read the book by Ann Rule to find out the exact details. 8.10.
