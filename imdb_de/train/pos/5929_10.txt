Stephen King was raised with such flicks. -Flicks NOT movies. <br /> <br /> Films like this and "Jeepers Creepers" are "setbacks" for the good old horror movies. They should be fun, cheap and hopeful: a few good scares. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for a theory about the human condition should pass that creature function on, because that's all it will always be. <br /> <br /> Stop the garbage that has already been considered garbage. -Good, fun, garbage! <br /> <br /> If you liked it, I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' 'Jeepers Creepers 2' '30 Days of Night '' Scarecrows '('88)' They Live '' Planet Terror '' Death Proof 'and' Halloween III: Season of the Witch '
