* I mark where there are spoilers! General remarks: If you can take a serious movie, look at it. Be open and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you are confused about what's going on! The film fits well in the second half. I will take my mother with me when the movie officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to see this at a screening a few weeks ago when Will advertised the film. He was great - spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the picture Will! About Wills Performance: When you watch a movie with an actor famous for another movie or show, you often think of them in their current performance as you see them for their earlier performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. I did not introduce myself to the Fresh Prince (lol) when I saw this movie. He was absolutely and absolutely convincing in this very, very serious role. As an actor he has grown enormously. I think he will at least get an Oscar nomination for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very confronted and tormented. He is sad ... guilty ... very determined but very scared. Very true to himself His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow Will managed to bring it to life. About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a nice job and portrayed Emily, a woman who stands behind her very much. Maybe she is not the shining star that Will shows in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not have that much to do with Wills. <br /> <br /> Action (no spoilers): I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie and nothing made sense until the second part or so. But if things ever go together, wow. Surprisingly well written and thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really stays with you. <br /> <br /> It really costs a lot to look at you. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end-even grown men. If you realize what Ben is doing and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Minor SPOILERS ***** That's why it's really hard to talk about that Give offense without big things. I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. However, there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed. I will mention some of them here (without trying to reveal much). <br /> <br /> - The fish Ben kept in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense at all. There was a lot of talk in the cinema when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> -I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. In the end, I loved him and hated him. So convincing was Will. I thought Ben was a big jerk for Ezra, a blind man who's just trying to find his way around the world. Why he treated Ezra like that became clear later in the movie. Wait a minute. Everything in this movie: Wait. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a basically good person who made a big mistake for which he can not forgive himself. It is still unclear to me whether he did what he did because he wanted to free himself from his own guilt or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you find that what he does is no less amazing. They hate him because he (as a very good person) is physically and emotionally. Good job, Will.
