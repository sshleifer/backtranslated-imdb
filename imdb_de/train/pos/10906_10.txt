I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same illness as Jonny Kennedy. I've never had a chance to meet him, but I've never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the development of this program has helped his fellow sufferers by drawing attention to this terrible condition. This man touched people in ways that could not afford a million charity brochures. I believe that this must be mandatory in schools. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him, and yet he managed to maintain his sense of humor. God bless. I could not see the part that showed his bandages were changed. I have enough problems with my son.
