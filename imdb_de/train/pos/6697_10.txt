I still remember watching Sabrina go to TV with ITV1 in the UK at 13/14. I'm 24 now and I still love it the way I did when I saw it for the first time. I get a small stick from some of my friends because I still watch a "children's show", but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan also became one of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching different special events that honor Sabrina on the Nickelodeon UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in "Clarrissa explains all," but so much better. I was disappointed when she decided to end it! I hope it will be released soon on DVD here in the UK - I'm the first in line! lol x
