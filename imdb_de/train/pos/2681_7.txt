As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific guy. He has made hundreds of films, many of which are crap. He succeeded, however, occasionally bring a quality work among all assembly line processing. "Succubus" is not his best work (this is either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many of his hallmarks that make it a must for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in his large catalog. He combines the erotic (alternately full frontal nudity show and something of the fantasy left) and the surreal seamless. This is a very beautiful movie full of great atmosphere. I especially liked the constant namedropping. Although it turned out to be incredibly challenging, it is amusing to hear all the influences of Franco. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are many users who do not like "succubus" and I can see where they come from. It's cozy, but I can handle it. More problematic is the incoherence. The script here was obviously rash, and within five minutes of the movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and from that point on it never really came together). Those who want to have some substance with their style are looking elsewhere. If it's a horror movie, it never gets really scary or even exciting. Still, I was amused by all the psychedelic stupidity that did not bother me so much about these big failings. (7/10)
