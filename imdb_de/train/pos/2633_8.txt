I have to be honest, I had expected such a bad failure, because it really sounded like they were trying to milk the original movie to get some money. But that was not the case with this pretty funny (sometimes weird) movie. I loved it, as they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and him, who had trouble sleeping, was funny. The whirlpool bubble and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will take a while, as it is suitable for video and DVD movies. While the movie seems a bit strange and runs towards the end, it works. 8 out of 10
