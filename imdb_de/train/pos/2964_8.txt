BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that provides acting that generally makes the movie much funnier, comedy material that's more than just scrap in the pants, and a pretty good plot, though it's the classic slackers versus the evil rich guy and the only thing I did not like about BASEketball was that this kid was not really needed in the movie, but if the kid was not in the movie, some of the funny scenes would not have existed. If you have read any professional reviews about this movie, exclude them all, because basically all reviewers did not like this movie. BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want. 8 out of 10 points.
