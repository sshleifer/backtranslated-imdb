What a wonderful, imaginative film "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily end it with this one statement and suffice it to say that one could consider it a very strong recommendation to see it. <BR /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood is determined to force remakes and sequels through its neck, "Stardust" reminds us why we even go to the movies - to escape reality for a few hours and other lives to explore other times or other planets. Ironically, Stardust effortlessly leads us to all three places with a childlike joy that we all long for. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and villains. It has the girl in distress, the heroes, the villains, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, spells and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from Wall, conveniently located next to a wall separating her city from a magical kingdom. The only way to get past the wall is through a lock vigilantly guarded by a scruffy old coder (wonderfully played by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall Ben Barnes names the old guard and flees through the clasp. He passes an enchanted kingdom named Stormhold, where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is gone, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to the Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he is called to the wall hook, where the old guard gives him what you might expect - a little boy. <br /> <br /> The boy named Tristan becomes a rather hapless young man (Charlie) Cox), who is in love with a girl outside his league and has also become engaged to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (called Victoria and Sienna Miller) goes out with Tristain once and he confesses her love. After seeing a falling star, she tells him that he can have her when he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out to find him, bringing him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Stormhold, the old king dies (played perfectly by Peter O'Toole). He calls on his surviving sons to tell them who is following him to the throne. The names of his sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other sons were killed by the other brothers in a humorous contest to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his ruby ​​dirt into the sky and Voila, which brings the star to the earth <br /> <br /> The star crashes in the shape of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and of course she has the charm. But she does not know that she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the prince, and an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut the star heart out to regain her own youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But everything comes together as the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria that he does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His initial interest was only to return Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But first he has to pass the prince and lamia. The princes are not such a big problem as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just like "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> Tristain also meets the witch who enslaved his mother (though he does not know it is his mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. His is the most important character of the film and DeNiro plays it off. He steals the film with his toughness and soon we learn a secret secret that will leave the audience laughing on the floor. Although his role is small, DeNiro is extraordinary! Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as a lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is best suited as a confused and desperate Yvaine. She makes a perfect girl. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of lightness as the fighting princes who die return as ghosts like "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> In addition, director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directorial experience was Layer Cake, tells an enchanting story that everyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is too complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 wants to watch this movie several times. It is so good. "Stardust" should be films. Perfectly written, perfectly staffed, perfectly directed and perfectly implemented. In other words ... perfect.
