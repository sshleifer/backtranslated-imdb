I do not know what I like about this movie, but when I saw it for the first time, I wanted to see how it ended. I am neither a big fan of Paul Winfield nor of war dramas, but I was really wondering how and when Winfield would find his child. He only knows that the boy has green eyes. To be honest, I have not seen this movie for years or have shown it on TV for some time, but this movie is a kind of a man's odyssey after the war pain. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart-warming depiction of a man lost to his memories. There is a basic message in this film that he is looking for the last remnant of human morality after this war and the reality he is facing. Why this film is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
