When I saw it for the first time, I got half of it, but I watched and later learned that it was a Salem witch trial. They focused on the family of Sara Good. She is famous for the cursing of a priest who has come true. In the movie showing her daughter Dorcas and her husband, the spirit of Ann Putnam Sara's husband comes to the future chasing this girl to redeem her soul. what happens at the end of the film. Dorcas is depicted as a witch at the age of 5 years, who is burned at the stake. What never happens, Ann Putnam rescues her from the flames. The girl is sure she is going to Ann Putnam's grave to see that this is not empty, but first because she reproaches her with witchcraft and has her burned. Now that Ann Putnam is saving her, her mind is redeemed, and she is not an outcast for the Salem witch trials.
