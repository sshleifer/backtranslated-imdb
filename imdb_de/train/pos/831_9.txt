I saw this movie while it was limited edition, mainly because of the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It almost starts off as a thriller, but is constantly evolving into a hilarious work of one-liners and great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Even though I say that this movie is a comedy, he does not forget that sometimes he has a heart and can be very touching, if need be. When I went to the theater, I did not know much more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt very happy with the movie and plan to see it again in a big release. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well written script and a big mustache.
