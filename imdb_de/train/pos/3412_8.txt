DOCTEUR PETIOT with Michel Serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if it can not be compensated. Nevertheless, he is the weakest of the population. The imagery and cinematography are outstanding and give this complex story a macabre feeling. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie that should not be forgotten by the audience. Kudos to Mr. Serrault for his dissuasive portrayal.
