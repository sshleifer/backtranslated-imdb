At first I thought this film was a typical western film, but it turned out to be very interesting and fascinated me to the end, which became very unusual. Charlton Heston (Sam Burgade), "Midway", 76, had previous experience with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", 93 and Zach never forgave Sam and did not stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), 'The Portrait of a Lady', '96, managed to get into this situation and found herself among sex-hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions, and I was pretty surprised at the conclusion. This is a very entertaining movie and the acting was outstanding.
