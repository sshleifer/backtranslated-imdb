One of the most up-to-date and exciting documentaries you'll ever see. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, it offers an insight into the political dynamic that prevails throughout the Western Hemisphere. While this is essentially another chapter in the history of the "US-backed Latin American Coup," this film describes in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political skill, and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights provided by this film are invaluable. It gives clear examples of the private media as an impressive force for mass fraud and propaganda. We see the poor of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of "American politics." One gets a clear sense of impending doom when the people do not respond to the blatant tyranny that was abruptly and illegally challenged by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism of the CIA-backed private media, plutocrats and generals, who plotted to bring Venezuela back under Washington's rule. Despite being cleverly managed by President Hugo Chavez, the inhabitants of Caracas are forced to act without him after Chavez was forcibly abducted by renegade generals. Your answer is the highlight of the film. If you're looking for a great portrait of what the US government, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela are all about, this movie is for you!
