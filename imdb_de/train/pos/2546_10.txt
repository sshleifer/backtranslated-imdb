This is roughly in the same league as `The Black Cat` although I would give 9 instead of 9+ here. This is indeed a praise for a movie that has been so greatly underestimated that it is amazing! <br /> <br /> 'The Invisible Ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part of science fiction. For a film from 1936, the science fiction elements were far ahead of their time. The mix of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect mix, while the acting of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements that influenced James Whale so often. What I mean by that is that this movie is scary and well-filmed. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosis room is a perfect example of the mood. It is an outstanding moment in the film that is so sadly lacking in today's films of the genre. <br /> <br /> Like "The Black Cat" and "Island of Lost Souls" I can not understand why this is so The movie still needs to be released on DVD. If you look at some of the garbage that has already been transferred to DVD, it's all the more puzzling. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have the chance. When it's released on DVD, pack it quickly and place it in a prestigious place in your DVD library.
