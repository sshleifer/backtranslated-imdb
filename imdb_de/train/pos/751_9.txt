This is one of Jodie Foster's best films, largely ignored due to the public's misunderstanding as a teenage film. It has wonderful performances, especially a fight scene between Jodie and her mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateur, but I think it's worth watching.
