"Home Room" came as a complete surprise. Since we had no idea what it was all about, it was well worth it, because it does not hold any punches and we see life changing with an unfortunate young man who has decided to sacrifice his classmates. Who are the innocent victims of his hasty actions? <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who edits and edits his own material, is a talented man rewarded by his amazing acting. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to graduate from high school. She has been away for several years and does not seem to be in the same wavelength as the other students. First, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of make-up and a mouth that will meet anyone who dares to approach their orbit. Alicia was one of the students in the living room where nine students died, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia is, as we know, a wounded girl who has had a terrible ordeal in her life, but we do not get any clues focusing on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should not have been at school at all. When she was hit by a Ricochet bullet, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. She tries to overcome this dark phase in her mind, but the nightmares do not let her forget her. <br /> <br /> Alicia is taken to the hospital by the school principal. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the headmistress wants Deanna to be experienced in her dreadful condition. Maybe she'll get softer and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a few days both girls will find peace. We do not know until the last sequence what really happened on that terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Lively Phillips is an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble. The film has an intensity because it does not explicitly show how the filming took place, which helps the tone Mr Ryan wanted to give this movie.
