Whenever I see the most reviews, it's called a misfire for Eddie Murphy. These critics want to take a look at what he's doing these days, and perhaps mitigate their posture a little later ... "The Golden Child" is not high-profile entertainment, but thanks to some performers, it revives old-time cliché and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand the pervasive lack of "love" for his efforts at all. Maybe it was released at a time when the establishment was tired adventures. Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to make this scapegoat a scapegoat, even though the possibly greatest sin is absolutely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to profit from trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, but even a casual observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is the beginning and end of Hollywood's idea of ​​mysticism. More important than the credibility of a story like this is that the audience has entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit well with this capacity. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and ride.
