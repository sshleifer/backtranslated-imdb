All good films "inspire" some directly to the copy film. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not a really good movie because for months I had not seen a movie that resembled anything reminiscent of something Roman. Then I discovered the latest offer from Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. Whatever ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus reports what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels forced to remove a helmet from a corpse and try on it. He becomes obsessed, and as the demonic gladiator Tyrannus, he is forced to kill his friends to revive the corpse, which is the true tyrannical budget. At times the editing and directing was so amateurish that I swear I saw the Blair Witch Project. Attempts to cut off limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python sketch. The weapons, though seemingly genuine, look really plastic. It literally looks like it's being filmed on a weekend by a group of friends using a digital camcorder. Granted, there is nothing wrong with such films, do not rent this and expect a technical masterpiece. It seems like there are also attempts to research the script, because although Tyrannus does not really look like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe not as much as a killer doll movie, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that in the end there was no Full Moon Videozone!
