At first I was not sure if I saw a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I think given the production time it was a mix of all three. Granted, the dramatic conspiracy was reasonably predictable. But you had the feeling there would be some interesting scenes in the course of the movie. We witnessed seemingly realistic training plans and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this movie came together was closer to the end for me. The scenes had a realism (at least the way I perceived it) that I have not seen often. They could put themselves in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants. This was mingled with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when one might think that real Japanese actors would be a little short. <br /> <br /> The film is a great source of American thought in 1943 when the war was waged with Japan. Interesting was also an excavation of the Japanese in relation to the help, which the USA Japan had accomplished in the past years.
