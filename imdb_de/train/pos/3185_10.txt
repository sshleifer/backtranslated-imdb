Lovable story ........ voted against every 10 for my age and gender ... not too much comedy (compared to a movie that I'm almost wet myself), though weird enough. Not a fan of musicals at all, so maybe a little too much for me, but they will give you time to grab a drink or a soda without missing out on anything important. maybe a 50s version of when Harry met Sally? Ahab no, not really, but if that's in your top ten, as it's mine, you'll like this movie. It just leaves a warm, blurry feeling that reminds you what romance could and should be like, something to shoot at. My summary describes it best in a few words ..... quite charming
