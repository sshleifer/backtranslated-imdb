I never saw this movie until I bought the band last year. I was fascinated and entertained. It contains all the elements of what I like to see in a sci-fi story, in a book, or on the screen. There are social commentary, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something weird and amusing about looking at the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s of 1936. I think it's a must, not just for Sci-Fiers.
