So for this TV movie only a 7.6 on this page? Bah! Humbug! Without a doubt, this 1984 version of Dickens' classic story is the best ever made. And yes, the Hound saw the 1951 version, which was good too, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest drawback of this version, although the spectacle was wonderful. George C. Scott is unbelievable as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this stingy merchant being persecuted by the mind of his dead partner, later of three other spirits. Scott is pretty rugged as Scrooge. For some critics who claim that he can not project the newly found joy he wakes on Christmas morning, it is too crude after the ghosts have given him a valuable lesson. But hey, that's George C. Scott. He will never go dancing in the street in joyful joy. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge projects his emotions in a realistic way. The supporting performances are consistently outstanding, as are the costumes, the music and the scenery. 19th-century London is brought to life in the visionary style of Clive Donner. In several scenes in which the ghosts are involved, the movie is even scary. However, the important history of morality is evident in every frame. <br /> <br /> You will not be getting this version on TV often, and that's a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be an integral part of every household's holiday celebration. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie should be at least once in the DVD player during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
