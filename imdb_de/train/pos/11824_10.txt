Dick Tracy is by far the best comic-based movie. The film has the same feel as the comic book and remains true to the color scheme. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has true stamina as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The good ones defeat the evil, without blood and blood, to convey the point. Al Pacino does a wonderful job from his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is unforgettable as a breathless. But the best job is Warren Beatty, who personifies Dick Tracy as much as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait for it to be released on DVD on April 2nd, 2002. My band is thin.
