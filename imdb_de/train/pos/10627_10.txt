What makes a really independent film? Unfortunately, at a time when the latest Hollywood mainstream fashion seems robust and innovative, I have to say that what the general public perceives to be an independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy. <Br /> <br /> So we should be glad that films like "Hate of a Minute" exist. Down the line, the film makes a contradiction to his own submission (indie horror movie). Love it or hate it, "hate" is not afraid to be what it is, and when you watch this movie, you have the feeling that Kallio (the director) has not only made this film to be fake Blood spray everywhere, he's in this to tell stories. The good ones. You may find this movie in the horror movie section of your video library, but do not be fooled. This story is also about love, about good people being pushed over the edge, and this oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect dirt or a bad rip-off, stay away from this movie. But if you find out the intricacies of the horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie and I'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not "Evil Dead". Bruce has never tried to rely on his "ash" image and it is obvious that he does not engage in "hate" to do it. <br /> <br /> However, my advice to all dead-ites who devour wildly all that Mr. Campbell has published is to still watch this movie and see what Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are still trying to do To show you. <br /> <br /> The acting is well done, although nothing about this film is an Oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. So many times actors in movies like this do not even seem to be trying, with "Hatred" it seemed like all the actors took their characters very seriously and never resorted to a typical horror movie campaign. <br /> <br /> Technically, "hate" is about as proficient as the indie movie. The editing is fast, the cinematography is good given the budget, and "hate" keeps a fast pace, with no balance or bad anti-climaxes. <br /> <br /> All in all, hatred may not be the case I have the overjoyed look of all those many millions of dollars of fake indies, but personally I do not see any problem with that. It's a movie of people who really care about the medium. People who grabbed their broken pockets, pulled out their nails and dimes, cast caution to the wind and made a damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
