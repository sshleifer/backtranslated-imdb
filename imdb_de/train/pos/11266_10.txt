I looked at it recently, but when it started, I had no idea what the concept was, what the topic was. In short, I had no idea what it was. It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ... Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a bit slowly, but I think because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was looking at. But it quickly got me involved. In my episode, Robert Wuhl had discussed facts and fiction in the story. Mainly how we (Americans) learn history that is not really true - and how we could learn what we did. He did this in a way that kept the viewer completely entertained and interested. I have actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this taken up as a series for HBO. I think it can be as fun and effective on a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
