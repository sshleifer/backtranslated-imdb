One of the best directors of Miike Takashi. It's so good that it's hard to put into words. With almost fifteen years older than the target audience, it has inspired me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's reminiscent of similar children's movies from the 1980s in the sense that these films (as opposed to today) were not afraid to be afraid - There are a lot of unpleasant details that I initially found annoying but soon I realized that it was nothing but what I grew up with. The film is a compilation of film conventions for children of the 80s. They call it, it's there: a young hero pushes out of his own unfortunate / dysfunctional world into another inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; an attempt to save both worlds from evil power; a beautiful heroine with whom he has a crush; a sadistic henchman (Go-Go Yubari by Kill Bill Vol. 1); a main villain who gets his evil power out of something that everyone in the world can identify with. All of these genre conventions, however, get a new twist and extra depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews begins "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and it is a feeling that I wholeheartedly agree with. Even as I saw it, I complained that I had not grown up with it. that it did not belong to my childhood like Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a lesser extent, The Neverending Story. These films and others, like The Goonies, are recalled but never copied. Miike relentlessly gives us a new perspective on things. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a staple of many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints, but often an artistic choice - the desire to present things in an alien way. Here, the CGI is mostly average only due to budget constraints, but it still makes fantastic to hold a spectacle. The CG effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world full of characters (and characterizations) that often borders on the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is considered one of the biggest kids movies ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Simply gorgeous. See for yourself and if you think your kids can handle it, show it to them. Let them grow up with the Great Yokai War as a small compensation for the fact that they could not.
