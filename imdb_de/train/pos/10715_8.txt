Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has made numerous guest spots and commercials here in Canada. Finally, someone has the sense to create a show for them. The supporting case also seems to be pretty good. I've watched the pilot several times now and still find it refreshing. However, I'm not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I could be wrong) But, as far as I know, the show was conceived in 2005 and appeared in early 2006 in Canada on Global TV a fresh idea and hopefully good. Too bad that this could not be combined with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner Gas is running on CTV, but the two shows would be great companions.
