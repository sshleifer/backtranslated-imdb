So much was written about the plot of the movie, about the wonderful acting, the script, the melancholic, bittersweet atmosphere and the great direction. What can I add? Just watch out for one of the most heartwarming, beautiful-looking, poignant scenes ever made. It's Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan's character (owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. When each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely declines him. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene brings me to tears easily. Luckily we have a happy connection to this very special scene. The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to leave the store in a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperate, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will spoil him with all the wonderful Christmas dinner that this errand boy has probably never seen! As Mr. Matuschek lonely and together they can have a wonderful Christmas dinner. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you get the wonderful DVD, check out the great trailer featuring Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the film's director - the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a pleasure from start to finish.
