"The Case of the Scorpion's Tail" contains all the elements required to create an effective Giallo movie. The story is standard Giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) receives a life insurance of one million dollars. The widow travels to Greece for payment but follows a series of gruesome murders. There are many suspects, including a stubborn investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the murderer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your vice is a locked room and only I have the key" and "Who has died?") Is a stunning-looking heroine. It's one of Martino's best films.
