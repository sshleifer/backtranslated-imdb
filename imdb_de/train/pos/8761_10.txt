I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in their role. The film is flawed only because it seems the two defendants appear to be in some monastery. They act like monks in the grass and under strict, almost martial-like discipline. The drama and filmography and the amazing colors of the alleged Thailand are striking, but Claire Daines steals the entire film and unexpectedly deeply learns the hard lesson of life itself, ending with amazing selflessness that did not exist in the real world and was totally unexpected , The shortcomings are tiny and I recommend the movie, which sadly seems to forever bury to rare television shows. I want the movie for my collection - a collection of only "10" rated movies. Look at it, you will be very touched.
