This show has been my escape from reality for the last ten years. I will miss it unfortunately. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (at least on TV) was beautifully done. Robert wrote something that felt very much like reality. As if trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (Everyone works so closely together, there are ups and downs. But over the years, they have become a family). I thought this would be a wonderful way to end up despite all the criticisms of another. <br /> <br /> SG1 was special and time and again it took me beyond the limits of disbelief and wonderment. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode one, I was addicted. The mix of action, science, drama and especially the comedy worked so well that I wanted more and more. <br /> <br /> There are no right words to fully describe what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It inspired me to do many things that I thought impossible. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to watching the movies next year and really hope there will be some of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
