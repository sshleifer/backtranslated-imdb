This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I glowed inside during the entire movie. The music and the cinematography enchanted when there was not much going on the screen. The slow pace was determined by the driving style (a large-mower lawn mower) and maintained by the background sounds and noises as well as the slow pace of life of the other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 years. There was no acting. Everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually turned into characters. Sissy Spacek gave a gripping performance as a somewhat handicapped daughter who had suffered a lot but was always ahead and always wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly staffed and he became beautiful to Alvin Straight, a stubborn but affectionate older man traveling through Iowa to his strange brother Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom in his life, and this seemed to be the best of the people he met on the way. The film underscores the importance of family for this man and, hopefully, for all of us. I'm really looking forward to seeing it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his directing skills. Farnsworth was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. At age 79, he was the oldest nominee ever to be awarded for the award.
