This was a strong selection of Poirot / Suchet, a television secret. The characters were lively and well represented. The plot and the headquarters - a dorm - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me the stories do not distract. An important point, many Poirot observers do not recognize a good acting or a good characterization. I also think that they pretty much judge some of Poirot's secrets. Finally, I've read some Christie novels - none in the last few years - and it's annoying that so many viewers are upset over changes in the novel. Please, viewers, think about what's being presented to you in the movie, not what you think should be there. The Poirot secrets are different in quality, but not so much as you would expect from the reviewers and reviewers. With the unique exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, the longer Poirot films are neither good nor bad. For the record I have seen the whole lengthy films of Poirot / Suchet. Films without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. However, the presence is either intrusive (almost always in Japp) or irrelevant to Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
