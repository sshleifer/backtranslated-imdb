This stupid movie is really fun for the younger audience. His heroes are a few Dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them on very stupid streets. If you're watching the big murder case, you'll find that these detectives do everything they can to solve the crime. No nudity, but many sexual implications, slapstick stupidity ... everything that teenagers aspire to. Low budget, but very entertaining. Safe cult classic potential.
