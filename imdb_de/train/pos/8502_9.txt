Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to see again and again. Michael Keaton is hired to recruit a Japanese car company that comes to his city to create jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is a funny moment after another. The two cultures meet and it's up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for great performances by Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly poured. Do not be fooled by the low rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the place name Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
