I did not know what this movie is about, I looked it over in the video store, and after seeing it I liked it. Little-seen multi-genre strip by director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy's I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception for this movie was the end. However, it is worth the rent.
