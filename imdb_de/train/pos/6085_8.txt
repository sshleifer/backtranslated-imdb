The critics are stupid. This movie is funny and smart. I loved this movie very much. Why does everyone hate this movie so much? I wish people would love this movie more than they did not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they've done a lot of work for this movie. I do not see people out there making films. People should just look at it and not comment. I like this movie. It's all right. There are parts where it is stupid, but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller would love that, because this movie is played just like King Of Queens. But that's better than that. I can not believe that this was rated so low.
