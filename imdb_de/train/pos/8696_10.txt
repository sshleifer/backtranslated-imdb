Scenes is one of the most prized gems of the '80s, and delivers razor-sharp satire and stellar performances by Arnetia Walker (how did she not get loads of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delicious broadcast of class warfare and of people in these classes. The writing is funny and the characters are not subtle, but nuanced. I'm sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese blackmailer one of the characters other than "gang" as "gang") were not classified as "sociological value". The value here is in what the movie makes fun of, and in the sparkling way it does it. I found it creative, funny and idiosyncratic.
