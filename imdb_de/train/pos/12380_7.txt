NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old brownstone, where she meets some bizarre neighbors and experiences some spooky hallucinations. When Attorney Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) investigates on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her will to live) as her experiences affect her physical, mental and emotional health /> <br /> I do not want to spoiling the better moments in this psychological horror movie for those unfamiliar with it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the movie does not really scare much. Or for every atmosphere. It's kind of quietly scary, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It is rather a story about a woman's attempts to cope with the increasing unreality in her life. It works at this level, but it's not strong enough. <br /> <br /> What "The Sentinel" * offers * are some eye-catching standards (especially the fascinating, incredibly spooky climax) There is a scene with Beverly D'Angelo that one must have seen to be believed. There is also something to see Gore, but not very much. An ominous music score by Gil Melle contributes to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this film would be complete without an assessment for the filmmakers when collecting such outstanding actors for their ensemble cast. Some of them do not have much to do, but seeing them all together is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impression as hard-nosed detective and worried neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum make short appearances. Other well-known faces are Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balm. Whoever was the casting director for this movie deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> For the movie written by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the "Death Wish" series he shared with Charles Bronson from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I would not call that a really big horror thriller, but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining. <br /> <br /> 7/10
