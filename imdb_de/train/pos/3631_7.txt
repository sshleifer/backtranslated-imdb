The film has a pretty good story, but gets stuck in some important places. It's almost as if the director had thrown the film together without taking the time to do some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but in some key scenes, something is clearly missing. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour movie could have been reduced to about 2 hours. And probably it would have been a much better movie if he did not feel like he'd been thrown together. <br /> <br />
