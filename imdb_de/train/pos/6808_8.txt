The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more of a "real thing" (Think about it: Do we really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a color world, and many people did not even know what it was, and it gave the opportunity to make it new for television. If you create it again, you can show something that does not appear in the original. The book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first "non-fiction book". Truman's book did not really correspond to 100% of the actual story. I thought the Canadian site was enough for a TV movie for Kansas. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: Dick's Womanising, Perry is an aspirin junkie, Perry plays blues guitar.
