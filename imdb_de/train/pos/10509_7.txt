I did not read the novel, though I understand that this is a bit different; The fact that I enjoyed it a lot, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision not to read the book any further. Since I have not read a single word of Austen's writing, I can not compare it to any of her works. What I can say is that almost every line of the dialogue is clever, witty and good-humored and is also the biggest source of the comedy. That made me laugh a lot, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is on time and Paltrow plays the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. Some of them, however, were extremely irritating, and although I think that at least some of them should be funny, they tended to over-repeat, and frankly, it was not funny when they first showed up. The cut and the cinematography are wonderful and everything looks absolutely great. Plot and tempo are great, you never get bored. It ends in a really obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience prefers. I can not say that it did not keep me entertained, from start to finish, and I would take another look at it. This is a short language. I recommend it to every fan of love stories. 10.7
