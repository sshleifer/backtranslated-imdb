Stunning, this is without a doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. For the first time in the late '80s, I saw heaven as a castle in the sky, leaving a lasting impression. Years passed and I forgot the title of the film. Only by chance on the Internet I found this masterpiece again. After reading the reviews and analyzes of other peoples, I am not surprised that it finds so much recognition and has touched so many because it leaves an impression. A true fantasy adventure, a must for all children and adults. It is best not to divulge the story, so I would say the movie is clear and open-minded. If you have children, treat them with them, I promise you that they will love it. There is not much to say about this artwork, but if you have not seen it yet, have a look and enjoy it.
