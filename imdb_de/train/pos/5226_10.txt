What about all European (especially England) comments? All I have to say, when I saw this movie for the first time, when I was 13 years old, I thought it was great. Of course it is stupid. That is the point. You have to watch the movie Dr. See Strangelove and Men in Black to get all the jokes behind this movie. I can imagine many films far worse than these, and they were expensive Hollwood films with real actors. Men in White is a very stupid-funny mockery of a movie. And with all the stupid-funny stuff that England has been doing for half a century, I'm shocked by the negative comments. We stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see "Team America: World Police" for some real laughs that Europeans will love. HA!
