As the story in my family tells, my dad, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey Band. After Sinatra joined the band, my father trained for hours with him. Then, at a certain point in time, my father told Sinatra that he was too well off to be tied up with such a small group (band) and that he should risk it alone. At that time, Sinatra had enough credits "under his belt" to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest is, they say, history. <br /> <br /> I have some pictures and recordings, as well as Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost every Sinatra movie more often than I would like to say and its films never get old. , , Thank you, Frank
