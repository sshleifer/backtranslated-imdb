Yaitate !! Japan is a really funny show and I really like it! It was recently shown in our country every 5:30 in Hero TV and ABS-CBN. It's about Azuma Kazuma trying to fulfill his dream of Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the southern Toyo branch of Pantasia and helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight against other talented bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different types of bread, but also learn to cook different foods. It's a really fun and unique anime as it also mimics characters from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. It is one of the best works of Takashi Hashiguchi and is really a must for people of different ages.
