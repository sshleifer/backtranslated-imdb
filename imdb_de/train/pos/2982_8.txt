I really enjoyed this movie. I am firmly convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are weird geniuses of our time. They have the uncanny ability to lend pop culture this absurdity and to ridicule it in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This makes South Park soooo funny. Once you've gotten over the fact that it's probably the most vulgar and unobtrusive cartoon of all time, you'll see the message being delivered in each episode. That's obvious in BASEketball. Although it is led by David Zucker and is absolutely ridiculous, it has a sincere message about the America of the companies and the shame that prevails in the top sports. I'm also a fan of sports, so sometimes I find this movie weird because it's so true in this bizarre way that people love to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... every time I see these Riverdance footballers start, tears come from laughing! Some people may not like this movie because it's not for everyone ... but just like South Park, once you get past the absurdity ... it has a really authentic message conveyed by the real weird genius. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
