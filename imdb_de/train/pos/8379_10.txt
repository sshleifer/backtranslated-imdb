I remember this movie when I was 12, it was awesome. I remember the day when I did not see most of what I saw then. I even tried to buy it, but it's like a rocking horse! Anyway, the acting is a bit tough, but the story is amazing, considering it was a real B-movie on a low budget and the fight scenes were amazing. I must have seen it about 20 times. It was a very well made movie, and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant men controlled robots. Too bad that they had to spoil him with a crappy shoot of "Crash and Burn"! If you're a real sci-fi movie fan, look at it, if it had been redone today, it would be a winner. I would really like to see a remake or even release the DVD of it.
