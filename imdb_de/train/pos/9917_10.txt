This is the most confrontational documentation I have ever seen. It was a simple and stunning view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes that focus on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings confrontational issues to life that we so easily ignore, a moving picture of realities that our Western societies are not aware of - the byproducts of economic growth , the externalities paid by the citizens of the less developed communities, the source of our comfort and the waste of our lifestyle /> <br /> Amazing, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but worth it - please stop being ignorant, and at least look at these photographs of the truth without feeling the pressure to face these questions. Definitely!
