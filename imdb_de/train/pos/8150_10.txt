My, Kasi Lemmings is certainly a pretty woman. This movie is a lost gem, a total satire "mockumentary" of the hip-hop scene of the early '90s, when MC Hammer had just disappeared into this good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark on a picaresque journey full of wealth and glory. And like Nickolas Nickleby, they end their journey not far from their starting point, but at least a little wiser and less naive. This is one of the best movies no one has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you either love or hate, much like "Company Man" in that regard. I look at this movie like the 1000 islands of the state of New York: It's a wonderful little secret that you want to keep to yourself.
