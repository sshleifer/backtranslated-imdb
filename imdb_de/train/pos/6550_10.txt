If I was interested in a Nancy Drew book, I would get a book and read. I'm not. Since I remember, I've read people who have thrown away movies because they do not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can not watch movies on flipbooks, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in book form. When Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Oscar - "The book was better". When I saw "To Kill a Mockingbird," "the book was better." Now some people are upset again because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win Oscars - if anything, it will be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I say, give the movie a break. It's film, not paper. As a movie I found Nancy Drew very pleasant - with cameos by Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I've seen Emma Roberts in a movie, and frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and Eric; Her character remains constant throughout the movie and responds well to conflicts. A lighthearted film in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is nice at times. I give him ten stars because I really enjoyed the movie, would like to see him again and would probably buy him on DVD release.
