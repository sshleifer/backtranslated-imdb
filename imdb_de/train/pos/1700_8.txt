I loved this movie. They must respect dwarves who disguise themselves like tiny Martians. Sure, the story was sometimes thin, but you can not distance yourself from the way it was made. I looked at it over and over when I was 8 years old. It's a children's movie, and it has some of the best quotes ever. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" presentation is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Very well done, if you ask me 8 out of 10.
