A highly recommended masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story, but also for the incomparably brilliant and ingenious work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of the giants Mastroianni and Moreau and the remarkable character play of Iliad's Logothethis. Gregory Karr's appearance may be overshadowed by the "hard" partners at first glance, but he actually plays his character, as shown in his last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and the man (Mastroianni), though hinted at earlier. (Therefore, the spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Let your expectations open! It is an "art film" in the meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention. Not to spend free time, but to look at a work of art with the necessary concentration, such as reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the general photographic style, viewing on large screens is recommended. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. However, in addition to the standard languages ​​that speak Greek and English, the film also contains fragments spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will be attractive to those who are enthusiastic about the beauty of listening to different languages.
