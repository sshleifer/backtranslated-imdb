With little money you can do a lot. Blair Witch proved that. This movie supports it. It is nothing more than a sitcom in length and complexity. However, with John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he even manages to count on a budget that can not afford the bells and whistles. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe, the sincere, awkward Watson, whose lightheadedness and slowness make clear Cleeses spirited joke. If you ever go over the movie, look at it for one or two funny laughs.
