Definitely a very good idea, the script was just fine. Could have been better. The positive is that it does not bore you if you are a lover of adventures. A new idea of ​​the lost world of Atlantis. On the negative side, I personally feel that this idea has so much more potential than this one. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all, but with a little more running time it would have been much better. Have fun, Cant say it was boring or was not good .. A good one for those who like adventure animations like Sindbad, like The Road to the Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people who are looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice, happy ending.
