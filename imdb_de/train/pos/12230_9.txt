THE MELTING MAN ... a tragic victim of the space race, he died MELTING ... never to understand the race, had LONG GONE BY ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns the hand of the kitchen stove But instead of yelling something a NORMAL person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" sounds. This movie you clicked on is not a normal movie. They've just taken the first step in THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous movie of the late 70s, which features Rick Baker's wonderful make-up effects. Baker was about to become a superstar while doing so with his famous "Cantina Aliens" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS did not become a household name and AMAZING MELTING MAN. <br /> <br /> It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just stupefyingly dreadful. From the opening credits (starring "Alex Rebar as THE AMAZING MELTING MAN" ...), the chubby nurse walking through a glass door, to the head of the fisherman walking over a waterfall and graphically diverge Rocks, this movie offers many, many moments of incomprehension. "Why did they ... but why did he ... why are they ...?" After a while, stop asking yourself why and see it for what it is - a very entertaining piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a melting, radioactive state; He escapes and begins to disintegrate his mind as well as his body, an insanely melting series of murders. The authorities quickly decide that the melting man has to be stopped, but (probably do not want to "cause a panic") that he is captured as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a Geiger counter. Wow. <br /> <br /> Storywise, during the movie happens surprisingly little. The melting guy walks around killing people. A doctor is looking for him with a Geiger counter. Different characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. Finally, the doctor picks up the Melting Man, but is shot by a security guard for no reason after declaring that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson." The melting man wanders away and finally dissolves in a big puddle Goo. The end. <br /> <br /> It's so mindless that it's kind of fun despite a rather rundown ending. Allegedly, a widescreen DVD release is planned. A very special movie.
