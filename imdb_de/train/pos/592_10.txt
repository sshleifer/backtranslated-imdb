At Arlington Heights, Illinois, we never had a cafeteria in one of the Elementary Schools (1961), so I cycled home from school and always watched this game. It's true, I was eleven years old, but I thought it was the biggest! I would draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember having won wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) when the contestant got the last hidden picture game. I even had the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game was so short. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I ever got was the lemon, which was hidden as part of a bridge over a garden brook. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are related to camouflage.
