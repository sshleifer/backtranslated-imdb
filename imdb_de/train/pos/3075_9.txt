A brilliant movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a pity to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like a neurotic sex object, but does not have the opportunity to work with him on the level the script demands. But he's such a good actor that he downplayed to their level to make the scenes work. I very much welcome the casting of Tracey Ullman as a neglected wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character appear larger (in some scenes even younger). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. Macy's account of the only situation in which his character can not be careful is a perfect mastery.
