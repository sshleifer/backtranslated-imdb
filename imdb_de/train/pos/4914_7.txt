A little bit of fun in life is to go through the old movie rental business and pick stuff just because I did not see it. It is a great pleasure to occasionally take this movie home and find a little treasure like this on my canvas. Long before Elia Kazan turned into a brand that produced only notable movies (not good ones), he did that better than an average drama. As you watch it, you notice how many decent, good or well-watched scenes have accumulated. Unlike his later films, in which the drama is capitalized ... preferably large and inconspicuous and scandalous. After all, Kazan was more of a calculating promoter than a director. (um. No thanks) <br /> <br /> His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. The plague is coming! But here is an untypical Richard Widmark, who plays a family man in 1951 and avoids most of the excesses of this tropic; Here is an almost observable Barabra-Bel Geddes whose swimsuit is turned down (good for her); They are a couple and tell a few nicely written scenes about big and small crises. Here is an expert comic survey with a talkative crew; Here is a nice moment when a hunt begins at a square warehouse and a flock of birds shoots over the head to interrupt the moment. These are the small achievements that a movie can make, where a viewer can actually see life. something Hollywood, in its greed, now avoids diligently. These are the moments when I go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a likeable human-scale film, not the grotesque, over-scaled production that he and others (David Lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still in the shit, as diverse as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge. <br /> <I've just looked at it twice and I'm damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is looking for in the final scenes, but it does not seem to matter to me as a spectator. This reminds me of No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain and Naked City, who really should get their hands on you.
