A captivating, honest, audacious and memorable psychological horror film that touches on painful rape-related pain - "Descent" is a movie that was under radar due to lack of distribution because the film is frankly so brutal in its depictions that it does if it had been published theatrically, it might have met a strong biased hatred. The film deserves to be discovered, not only for its dark themes and not just for its amazing direction and authentic style, but above all for its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning and carries enough sickness and vulnerability to create a person who has nothing to do with him, but to understand that this broken man has a twisted perspective on his sexuality, not just the women he raped, but also with the fragile insecurities inside him. It's a supportive performance that's as complex, brave and emotional as Faust. And hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the outstanding point is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A tour de force of realistic dramatic tics and one of the most subtle but loudest performances in quite some time. While starring in some great and bad films, Dawson proves she has what it takes to deliver emotional, engaging, credible and thematic performances. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of the year (and 2007 was a strong one) - If this underrated and intelligent movie had the theatrical release, I would praise it, as did Dawson and Faust. Too bad that it was too blunt for a widespread appeal. Movies like these deserve better!
