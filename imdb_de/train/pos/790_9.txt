Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male pornstar, even if he hangs his pants. <br /> <br /> The film tore at my heart and reminded me of the intensity of my husband's great, explosive love life. I do not think I can think of another movie except maybe Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, who capture that dizzying joy so well. <br /> <br /> The other attraction of the film are the very English eccentric characters who enjoy the scandal as a proxy. In that sense, it's almost the same charm as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery, without the chaos. <br /> <br /> This is a great antidote to the pseudo-terror popular in the US and any relationships between people of different ages.
