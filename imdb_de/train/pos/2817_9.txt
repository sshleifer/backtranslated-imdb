This review is for the extended cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> That is. I always found the story a bit confusing. After all, the movie is a love story. And it always seemed strange that a love story should end with a 20-minute fight scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version, that's not the case anymore. The old "original" version starts with a huge, barrel-up / rugby-like sequence that represents the new end sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan), who hangs in his house and pretends to train and recite whenever his father is around. Other sequences have also been moved in the Extended Cut, or extended a lot more sense when you see it. The tempo is better too and overall it just works better. It feels more like a love story and does not let you ask why it ends so drastically and dramatically, as is the case with the regular version of the Jackie Chan fanatic, who looks at the expanded version and sees the movie as he does originally intended (or at least I think it was intended) why would they otherwise manage to rearrange some scenes?) I felt I had seen a completely new film by Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences were identical.
