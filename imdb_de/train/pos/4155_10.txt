What a stunning episode for this beautiful series. This is first class television. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully filmed in black and white, almost like a film noir style with deep shadows and strong imagery. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil that. It is a rare representation of what homosexuals saw in America in the 1960s. Written by the great Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. To accept such a sensitive topic makes this episode all the more amazing. Our emotions are as torn and nervous as the characters. Chills ended up sprawling my back when playing Bob Dylan's beautiful game: "Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger then that," as sung by the Byrds. This goes far beyond a 10 and up to the stars. Beautiful.
