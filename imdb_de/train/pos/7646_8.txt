This film is one of my favorites because I have to think about all the decisions I have made and how my life would change if my decisions had been different. It plays directly into the theory of the "Multiple Universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that is not true is that Larry Burrows (James Belushi) finds it so difficult to understand what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
