ABC has done more for this show by allowing TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to cast this show. First, the show with John Ritter and Katey Sagal was seen and even predictable. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast. The hour after the death of John in real life occurred to me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and could understand and understand her pain and agony. ABC should be proud to uphold this show and even save it as John's last wish. This show has matured and evolved due to these impossible circumstances. You should be rewarded with Emmys.
