I recently bought the entire American Gothic series on DVD and she has fulfilled my memories of it. I was very grateful to see episodes that were never televised for the first time. I loved "Ring of Fire" especially in the stories I did not see the first time. Gary Cole is fantastic as a "bad, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a great player. I also found Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs outstanding in her performance. In fact, the entire cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the series was screwed by the network (in consultation with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was really designed for adults. A mix of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, goth romance and horror genres. She offered brilliant characterizations that were supported by ingenious acting life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the juiciest "fallen angel" of all time.
