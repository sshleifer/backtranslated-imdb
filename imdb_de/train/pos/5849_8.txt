Damn straight ..... this show was a jerk already by day and still trumps cartoons. I can not wait to find some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions, not the 15 vehicles) and I laughed when he said to me one day, "Dad ... you've probably seen some great cartoons when you were a kid was cool !! "How cool is that? <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, dust it off and give it a live action try. Could not be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 was pretty lame for the summer movies so far. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll shuddup now <br /> <br /> Cheers
