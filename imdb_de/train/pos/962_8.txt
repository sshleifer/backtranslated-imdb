I just watched this movie and I have to say that I was so impressed. Everything was great. The acting of the characters, the story. A credible child who has become courageous and always ready to help others. His mother has to be proud. I could not take my eyes off this movie for fear of missing something. It's the fairy tale of the prefects with morals, cute and scary sprites and "monsters", but still heartwarming people. A child poked and bullied at school and became a hero. He was chosen to be a driver at the local village festival and travel to Goblin Mountain, where he discovers the Yokai, an amazing creation that Brian Froud could be proud of. And the evil Kato and his off sider, who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects such as motorcycles and other mechanical things that assemble into terribly violent robot monsters whose sole purpose is to kill. Takashi, a little boy, is the one who becomes her savior, along with a red man / dragon, a turtle man and a river princess, and a cute little creature that, if it had been America, would have made it a cuddly toy and sold it in all good toy shops. The lines are good, especially do not try to bring home children and other jewels that will bring a smile to your lips. Expose the faith and watch it with a child or alone and enjoy it! However, I have to admit that the end was a bit sad. And not necessarily like that. Prost Furdion
