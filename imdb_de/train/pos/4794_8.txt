It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but - for a change - a life-affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick with it. Although moving as slowly as John Deere of Straight, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful remorse and secrets, and ultimately about the power of the family and the reconciliation when he encounters the friendly stranger on his pilgrimage. Richard Farnsworth celebrates his career with the most sincere performance of the year, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. And Sissy Spacek suits him as his "slow" daughter Rose, who cares about her own loss in taking care of her father. Seldom has a modern movie preached so positively about the family.
