In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brothers musicals, which allowed the depression age a temporary distraction from their woes. The 1933 Gold Diggers, 42nd Street, and the Footlight Parade were all in the Broadway Theater world. Basically, the same theme of the show must continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreographies, show-stop songs, and many of the supporting players. All are undoubtedly classics of their genre, but I have to admit that they have a clear preference for Footlight due to its pace energy and leadership of James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter on 42nd Street were admirable as the production bosses showed - especially Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of a recent box office hit. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney, which perfectly complements the frenetic pace of a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production figures, unscrupulous partners and a gold digger girlfriend. Of course, Cagney alone makes Footlight not the classic it is. The script crackles with some sharp double sets, which have been delivered by a stellar cast of Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, and most of all Joan Blondell, all reduced to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive, and risk-taking, and are set just before the introduction of the Hollywood Code in year 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and some time beyond would never see such a rich musical with the excitement and flair of Footlight again. Gentleness and morality ensured that.
