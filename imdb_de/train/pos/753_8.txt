Story about four teenagers who grew up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most prudent of the group - but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad guys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Straw) thinks she's more mature than the rest. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new from what we've seen many times - but this one has a big difference - it's true. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I saw the movie for the first time) and I was surprised how realistic it was. They did the dialogue, the clothes and the settings completely right. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a great success before it came out. This movie hit me harder than any other teenager movie of the time because I could understand and understand the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like that! The movie is (of course) outdated, but it does capture a time we'll never see again. <br /> <br /> Acting is good in every way, with Foster delivering the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who plays a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teenager. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - indispensable if you came of age in 1980. Film has a deserved R rating (lots of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teenagers. I give an 8.
