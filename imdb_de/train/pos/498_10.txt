I had expected that at the premiere of Star Trek DS9. Not too easy DS9. It was a wonderful show in itself, but it never really gave the fans what they wanted. Enterprise is this show. Although it bears a similarity to the original hike, it is different enough to be original in its own way. It makes the ideas of exploration exciting again. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so popular. Another factor in the success was the relationships that developed between the crew members. The audience really took care of the crew. Also in this area Enterprise is promising. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems promising. While sexual tension in a show can often turn into a crutch, I have the feeling that the tensions in the company can lead to much more and say much more than it is typical. I think when we look at such great characters of different races or species, we get some very interesting ideas and television. We should also pay attention to the performances. Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a temper and strength of character that delivers a great performance. The rest of the cast also performed well. My only problems are as follows. The topic. It's good, it's different, but a bit too carefree for my taste. We need something more great. Does not have to be orchestral. Maybe something would be enough with a little more electronic sound. And my other complaint. They sell too many accessories. You could fix this by selling fewer ads or making all shows two participants. Otherwise, we see that the final act of the shows is completed far too soon, as this was one of my complaints about Voyager.
