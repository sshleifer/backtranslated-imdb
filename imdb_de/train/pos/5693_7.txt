The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not-so-honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Some would say that this is America's tragic history in the 1980s, when the souls of the 1960s of peace and free love clashed with drugs and AIDS. To be honest, these are just normal people with no purpose in life who stand around and decide to rob a reckless man. What is the second part of your master plan? Once they have their stuff, they sit around and get up again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense and no surprises in this movie. The fact that Cox tries to make these characters a kind of folk hero, with party scenes and a montage of their prey, is weak and insulting. With a more straightforward approach, the story was better. It's just a sad story that small drug dealers are killed by big drug dealers. The big story is John Holmes in many ways. He's the center of this story anyway. This movie should have everything about him and his life. He was the one in Wonderland whose wonders were about to fade. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it's not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It is not very factual, but it is much more fun.
