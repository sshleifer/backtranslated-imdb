The 60s is a great movie (I've seen it all in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 60's. Although the title otherwise suggests that the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who takes to the streets in the US The Vietnam War There he meets his girlfriend Sarah. Michael's brother Brian is going to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He comes back from the war and switches to a "Tom Cruise Born on the Fourth of July", looks like and then in a Hippy.His father is a pro-Vietnamese war type (what a surprise !!) Michael's sister Kate is joined by one Rock & Roll artist gets pregnant and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco in the summer of love. The end is very bad (father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I let myself be deterred by my voice (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are included in the film, including the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the major hippie protests, the Summer of Love, and Woodstock! Check out the Welly "Woodstock Speaker" Sauce (for breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As the Woodstock Festival's first-aid staff! <br /> <br /> In the end, the sixties are gorgeous movie about a nice decade! 10/10
