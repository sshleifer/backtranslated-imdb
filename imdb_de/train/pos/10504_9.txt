Or at least one of the best. I think that's a very fun and cool game for the N64. Bowser sticks to his usual phenomena (yes, it's a stupid word, but the only thing I can think of) and Mario has to stop him again. This game is a lot of fun and contains a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are terrible for today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little minigames you can unlock). that I can recommend to any Mario fan or any fan of platform games. It's a mediocre Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
