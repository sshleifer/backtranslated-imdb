IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first ones have hired a professional killer, ANISIO, to assassinate ESTEVÃO (the conspiracy at least at the beginning I can not explain why The guy does it and after he gets his money, he begins to blackmail the two partners, appears in their company and says he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something?) And at the same time, he learns MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), Daughter of ESTEVÃO, know and start dating her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be a victim MARINA, the only person who does not know this, do you know what's going on and have not betrayed anyone? <br /> <br /> With sarcasm, this film shows the sad and cruel reality that lives in a big metropolis like São Paulo e xistiert, in which crime is commonplace. We can feel irony, but also honesty in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos) who blackmailed the guys who paid him without scruples and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! He really has to be a monster to do that, but of course I know there are people like him, in Brazil or some other place? <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie, cruel but honest, about a sad reality. The acting is great and also the soundtrack.
