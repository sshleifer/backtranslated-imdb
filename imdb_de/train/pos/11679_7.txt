Clara Bow's beauty and wonderful appeal are the main reasons to watch this movie. "hula" is not quite up to the best movies by clara, but it's still fun. She dances, she rides her horse and pursues the man she loves. This movie is just over an hour long and was directed by later Oscar winner Fleming. If you like Clara, I would recommend "Hula".
