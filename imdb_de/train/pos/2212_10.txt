E! Watching TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny that you can quickly see the episode change. We want more witty writings by the best writer Stan Evans ever wrote. The Patron of Mindless Crowds ... He is a truly talented, gifted writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative advisor. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was no billionaire billionaire, so he left him for a billionaire. Many superstars wanted to film movies with actor Stan Evans, who has a acting style called "Humphrey Bogart" (Clark Gable). He should still make many films. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg or maybe many other talented producers. We wish him a moment FAME with good luck. Has he produced any pseudo-U-dramas? or maybe some docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie by STAN EVANS. How many scripts did he write? Is he talking about Disney at $ 4,000, $ 4 billion, $ billions? He should earn more than 50 million dollars ... He could also write a TV movie about the deceased KING OF POP. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more of Stan Evans in the movies and on TV. Many many thanks. Elvis left the building !!!!!
