(Includes light spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Of course, many remember Stewart as George Bailey of Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life," so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life," Bailey sees the world as it would if it had never been born. In "The Far Country," Stewart's Jeff Webster, by not interfering to help others (except himself), sees essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) does not exist. <Br /> <br /> If he does not interfere (and tries to take care of nobody), Webster has to see those he can not help but being hurt does nothing. This reminds the viewer that George Bailey was watching an upside-down world because he also chose not to get involved by never being born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end with the same picture - a close-up of a bell. By reversing his philosophy of non-participation, Stewart has earned his "wings."
