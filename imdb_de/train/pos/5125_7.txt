I bucked up to the bar and expected this to be a hot beer on a hot Texas day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through Saturday Night Foolishness, I did not feel like seeing a reissue in a southern Texas barnyard. John Revolta was good as a jealous Redneck, Scott Glenn was an exotic Thuggie and Debra Winger was as always a pleasure. * Love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and that comes from a man who does not like the sound of country music]. A fun movie.
