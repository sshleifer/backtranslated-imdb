I saw this movie in my local movie channel and enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good teenage film and more - apart from dealing with boy-girl relationships and sex and the like, this film also deals with the issue of using steroids among young people. > The movie feels like it's in real life - no loud music, no special effects and no vile scenes - which was right for this movie. This feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie - some of whom we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall a good movie that is fun to watch. > 8/10
