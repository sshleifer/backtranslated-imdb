When I heard that this movie came out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that this was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before seeing the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been different if I had not read the book. The authors have actually done a good job of staying true to the book's main message, with minor differences, of course. I think most of all disappointed me that Boyle played the role of Colonel. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that, no matter what the mood during the movie, she always tries to use it -squeezing lips and dark-painted eyes to make her look super sexy. I think the movie stuck to the real horror of the house. My favorite underground was the Sheehan family (which is so strange when the son was killed in Iraq and in recent events there is Casey Sheehan, whose mother went for a big anti-Iraq tirade). In the book, the war was obviously not Iraq but Vietnam. When the house turned the son's video in the helicopter, I was really scared. Overall, I was impressed with the film as it followed the book very well.
