As many critics have noted, the movie version differs significantly from the stage version of the story. I have never seen the stage version of the story, so I have a cheaper rating of the movie than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers who wanted to spend big time on choreographer Michael Douglas' show. The movie works by not selecting any famous actors or performers who end up in the final try-out group. In this way, we focus on the movements and individual stories of the dancers who develop during a marathon day with try-outs. Douglas is probably not the best choice for the part either. Apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new song and the backstage clich√© story was added to a romantic connection between a dancer and the choreographer. I have to say quite fairly that this was the weakest part of the movie. The repeated interventions that Cassie made during the rehearsals seem to reflect the almost desperate requests that are often made when engaging in artistic careers in the absence of talent and / or happiness. However, this aspect of the film has been put to death in the past, and it's strange to see this tired old shoe kicking his heel again. The revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly with the number "I can do that," but then they appeared in different places while the dancers were telling their stories. Honestly, their stories are hardly different from real life people who never have such a chance. *** of 4 stars.
