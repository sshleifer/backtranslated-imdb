After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally ends up in a bottle of invisible ink that was part of a chemistry set. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so the predictable results occur, which means he uses his new hidden state to torment Tom. Jerry often just defends himself, but often he has sadistic traits in him that torment the cat whenever possible, even if it is not unjustified. Here he lets Tom think his eyes fool him when cheese comes out of a mousetrap disappears before his eyes or milk from a plate. Tom can not take it anymore, so he tries to sleep late, but Jerry lights his paw! Man, I hope that little kids had no idea to watch these cartoons in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than sweet. <br /> <br /> In cartoons, the damage a character suffers usually disappears in seconds and he is back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom finds out what the story is with Jerry, and uses different methods to find out where the mouse is (for example, flour insert) on the ground to see his footprints).
