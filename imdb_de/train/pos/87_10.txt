This Oscar winning film is one of the best in the genre. Narrated without dialogue, it is a visual treat about a boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly places him in a bowl, then goes to school and leaves the goldfish unprotected, leaving a window carelessly open. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes through the window and slowly approaches the bowl. The fish apparently knows something is going on and gets very excited. When the cat comes very close to the bowl, the fish pops out. The cat catches the fish, drops it into the bowl, and steps through the window he came in, just as the boy who does not know what happened comes back. This was amazingly filmed with real animals; It is remarkable how Cousteau got these animals to behave that way. I just wish this movie was available to people now; I only saw it once, 1959, when it was originally published, but it has remained unforgettable.
