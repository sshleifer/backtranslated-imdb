A remarkable documentary that gives a vivid picture of a country that is deeply divided (see the comments on IMDb ... for more proofs). Compared to Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mainly an in-depth look at Fidel Castro's nose hair), it is extremely cheap. I do not know if Chavez is anything he presents himself or any other in the long line of populist Latin American "caudillos". I do not know whether he can enforce the huge expectations that he has evidently caused among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It's hardly reasonable to expect such a film to answer such questions - but I now have a pretty clear idea of ​​what's at stake and what it feels like to get caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the movie "We're writing history," and that's exactly what the movie feels like catching. Outstanding stuff.
