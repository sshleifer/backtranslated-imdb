SPOILERS Like other posters, I felt the end was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to see how the crew got used to life on Earth after their return. I suspect the authors foresaw this problem by preloading some Voyager sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this timeline has been eradicated, so everything is fine.) I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get our cake and eat it by bringing Janeway the ultimate sacrifice as well as life. I admit that the scenes in which Janeway and her older self talked were bizarre and could easily have crossed the camp boundary. Luckily, mulgrews did it.
