My main problem with the movie is that it takes too long. Apart from that, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who wants to marry through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and they are doing very badly. When he finally gets money to buy some land, a drought hits and nothing grows. All stars heading north from Muni will initially be left behind. When they go and arrive in the city, they realize that they have no work and are feeling worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but decide against it. When a few people loot the city, the military appears and begins executing people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this film.
