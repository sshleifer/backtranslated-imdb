IF FRIENDSHIP KILLS is, in my opinion, a very touching and heartbreaking drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) wanted to puke, I wanted to throw up. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative in things. However, I enjoyed seeing them do things together and being taught by their parents. Before summarizing, let me say, "If you ask me, when FRIENDSHIP KILLS actually shows how much anorexia or bulimia can affect a person's body." did not see it You have tears and a good time. Next time you're on TV, sit back with a friend and have a look.
