The father of who's alcoholic drummer Keith Moon was called Arthur. I found so much in common in this film between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli, who normally took over OVERACTS, did a pretty good job in this and was able to cheek Dudley Moore on every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John has stolen absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" movie that gives the viewer an insight into another life. We often try to capture a replay of this movie via satellite. Gottruhe Dudley Moore; That was such a nice movie. Lots of satire and thumbs down to the rich and the snobby / wealthy. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite endearing.
