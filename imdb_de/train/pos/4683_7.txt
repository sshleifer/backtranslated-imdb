A classic shoot with whimsical music box music. This film shows a chain of tough relationships, moving from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again, ending in carousel style for persons A & B. The film gently examines the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shades beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. The downside of this movie is the lack of a story that could be related to the many critical slams.
