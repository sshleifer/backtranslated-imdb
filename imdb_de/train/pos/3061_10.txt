This movie shows the kind of ensemble work you want in every movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positively chilly and talk about the "family business" as if it were a grocery or a dry cleaners. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are great too. They play off each other like members of a top-notch theater company, recognizing that one quality product requires each actor to serve others disinterestedly. And finally there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What an amazing achievement from a child ... and what an eerie resemblance he has to Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> In "Panic" we have a unique story, and that's a rarity these days of tired formula waste. The dialogue is sharp and clever, and yet this relatively short film still has the power to elicit a whole range of emotions from the viewer. There are places where you can laugh, be shocked, be horrified, be sad, get aroused, be angry and love. It's not a movie that makes you jump for joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know that you've spent the last ninety minutes doing a hell of a piece of work. <br /> <br /> More of us would go to the theater if we were treated with such food. When will the powers wake up in Hollywood? It is a real shame if something that is so good results in going beyond festivals and households lucky enough to have cables.
