Things to Come is a historical movie. Together with Metropolis (1927) it is one of the first major science fiction spectacles. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II within a year, and subtly the year in which it would end in the real world. But then the film leaves the reality and shows a war-torn world (only replacement gas for nuclear weapons, which of course did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is unbelievable sight, groundbreaking use of models and matte pictures - later becoming staples of the science fiction genre. It's sad that Sci-Fi identifies itself with cheap B films after "Things to Come", a stereotype that would not be broken until 2001: A Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they stayed with the quality of the effects in this movie, things would have changed a lot in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play several roles in this film. Massey plays a large "Doctor Who" -like role as a pilot of an advanced (1970s) civilization trying to gain the population of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). After all, the story covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this movie - there is really no coherent plot. <br /> <br /> In such an episodic film that is reminiscent of intolerance, it may be difficult to have a conventional plot, but I felt that more of the material could have been made, and although the visuals In the last third of the picture are really stunning and worth the price of the recording ... The plot is not available and the film itself suddenly ends as he is interesting. Maybe the producers have thought of another future science fiction innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a movie that every serious sci-fi fan should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, this can not be repeated.
