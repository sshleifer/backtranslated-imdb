Chuck Jones 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often funny cartoon. Bugs Bunny plays against a strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed. "Hare Conditioned" takes full advantage of its versatile environment. The persecution leads Bugs and his pursuer through various departments, resulting in an inspired gag in which they quickly come out from different departments and wear the clothes associated with that part of the business. However, this great gag is trumped by a truly inspired sequence of lifts in which bugs disguised as a lift boy cause the store manager to relentlessly get in or out of the elevators at the wrong time. It's a brilliant, climactic set-piece, which unfortunately has to give way to a not very funny endgag. However, at the time, "Hare Conditioned" has established itself as one of the great chase movies bursting with wild energy. As bugs became finer and finer in some other cartoons from that time, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that he could still be as appealing as an anarchic character.
