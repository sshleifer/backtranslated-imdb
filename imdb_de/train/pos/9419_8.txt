This star of Alec Guinness is a very good, witty political satire of the corporate industry and a slightly eccentric character study. <br /> <br /> The tempo is a bit too slow for a comedy, and none of it is really funny on the ground, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. But it has its amusing moments, and it is very skillful in its execution. The segment of the big explosions is probably the most distant element. <br /> <br /> The union procedures are pretty droll and very reminiscent of I ALL RIGHTS JACK. especially the female socialist with a slight romantic infatuation with Guinness's character. The political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a Heavy. <br /> <br /> I do not think this one works as well as THE LADYKILLERS or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even light-weighted comedy is better than nothing.
