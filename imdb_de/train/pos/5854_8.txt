This game is fun and it has an action that you might expect in the comics. Spider-Man was framed by a mysterious cheater. The city is overrun by a weird gas, and symbiots like Venom and Carnage appear all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have come up with a new leaf. Venom does not seem to be involved either, simply convinced that Spiderman apparently cost him a pretty good photo opportunity. Well, cameos from other heroes and many villains later, Spidey will solve the puzzle. The battles are fundamental and not difficult to grasp, the fights with the bosses are fun. They collect comics, they have no internet and it's fun to travel around the city. But that is also a weak point. The swing is not as great as anything you do is float through the city while Spiderman seems to be hanging his nets up to the sky. They also do not have much maneuverability, especially when compared to a Spider-Man 2 video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad resonances of the other elements, especially the story. Be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Octopus Doctor and Carnage on a wild action ride.
