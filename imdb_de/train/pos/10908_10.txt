I could not hold back the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is looking for something that makes them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or just something that makes you think. You see how John lives the last few months of his life. You watch him go through his days with a positive attitude. At one point, you begin to realize that he is truly an amazing person. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us. His life and his struggles will make you cry and laugh and you will find that life is much easier to live if you only take it one day.
