Very different topic covered in this movie. A simple and simple description of local Chinese customs, looking at the daily running of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when the elder son returns home and falsely believes his father has died. As every man in the city makes his daily visit to chat, play games, discuss personal matters and receive honest advice, in addition to the usual spa-like therapies. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties force the older son so that the public bath operation is not disturbed. And finally, the introduction of modernization to end this kind of relaxation and get along. The public bath must be demolished to build a commercial complex.
