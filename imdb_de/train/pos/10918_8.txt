The Five Deadly Venoms is by far the most memorable K.F. flick from the stable of the Shaw Brothers (exc. ​​maybe Master Killer). It has made some of the best fight choreographies of all time, and surprisingly for a kung fu movie, a great action for the artists who simply became known as "The Venoms"! One of my absolute favorites !!!
