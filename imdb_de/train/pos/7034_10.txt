If you combine all aspects of the film - dancing, singing, acting - Vanessa Williams is the only one that turns out to be the best. Her devotion, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her. I've never seen anyone who has portrayed Rose with such vivacity! Vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she plays Rose, and her acting skills impress me again and again! Their dancing is so incredible, even though some people say that the choreography was bad - their dance skills were better than ever! I would recommend this version over the '63, just because I think that acting Vanessa is great except for Chynna Philips ... what the hell they were thinking when they cast it?) All in all I would say, that this version is wonderful, and I recommend everyone to see this version!
