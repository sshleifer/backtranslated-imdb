This movie is a perfect representation of the nutcracker; The dancing is wonderful, the backdrop in the background was excellent and I loved this floating bed. Oh, and the costumes ... I especially loved marzipan, the tutu was adorable. The special effects were done very well (eg the tree, the bed, etc.), and I really liked the rats. I love that they did not make them scary, but cute and huggable. Except the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you're a thoroughly masculine person, you will not enjoy it, but this is a very good movie suitable for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> First: Why did you have to put Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in those awful tights? It would hardly make a difference if he were naked! And secondly ... why did they have to do PINK outfit on the EARTH Culkins outfit?
