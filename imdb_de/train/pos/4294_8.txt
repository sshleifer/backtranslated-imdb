After leaving the cinema, there was no dry eye among the spectators yesterday afternoon. I saw this gem in a sold-out house during this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the tears shed all laughter. This movie was hilarious, you can not say that otherwise. It was not a boring piece in it, I laughed through and with me all three hundred lovers of French Cin√©mas. Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific. A great clown if needed, and serious when the situation requires it. The performance was of course exaggerated, but that's exactly what the story needed and what it worked so well. Equally great was Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to see, and the mother was also a very strong performer. The sisters could have been a bit more detailed in terms of character language, but otherwise there's nothing to complain about. I had a great afternoon watching this movie when Hamburg drowned outside in the rain, and I wish such films from France would appear regularly in Germany. But the distributors are that this country does not seem to understand that the French make good films. I can not wait to find a DVD that contains subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), As I have to watch this movie several times at home!
