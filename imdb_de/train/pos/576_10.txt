This movie was just brilliant, casting, filming locations, story, director, everyone really suited to the role he played, and one could only imagine that Robert Redford is a great actor and now the same director is like the Scottish island myself, so I found the fact very well that there was a real connection to this film. The funny comments throughout the movie were great, it was brilliant and I bought the movie as soon as it was released for retail I recommend it to anyone and fly fishing was fantastic, it really cried, in the end it was like that sad, and you know, what you say, when you're crying at a movie, it must have been good, and that was definite, even congratulations For the two little guys who played the role of Norman and Paul, they were just brilliant. I think kids are often deleted from the praise list because the stars they play all make such a big profile for the entire movie, but these kids are incredible and should be praised for what they've done Not? The whole story was so beautiful because it was true and after all that was shared with all of us, it was someone's life.
