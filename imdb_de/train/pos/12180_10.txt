In my opinion, A Guy Thing is a funny, funny, sexy, romantic and totally beautiful chick movie that guys will enjoy as well. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled like a confused groom and his soon-to-be sexy brother-in-law. If you ask me, they have lit the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I summarize, I would like to say that the performances were first class, the direction was perfect, the production design was beautiful, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. Finally, I recommend anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, this movie. There is a lot of laughter and thrills, so go to the video store, lend it or buy it, sit back with a friend and look at it.
