This must be one of the best movies that has come out of HK for a long time. I was anxiously waiting to get my hands on this movie if I just watched the title. Many fantastic actors on this show and I was particularly impressed by Sam Lee's incredibly believable crazy behavior and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine that completely reversed his normal idol image. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and action packed movie. But I have to warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, because every character in the film is in a kind of dead end and trouble that is difficult to breathe. Lets you think about what life is really about.
