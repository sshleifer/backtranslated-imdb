A good movie with strong performances (especially the two leads). The film is about two American girls caught on an airport in Thailand with 6 kilos of heroin. Both are thrown in jail and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get her out. All you have to do is find a Nick Parks, who puts the narcotics in the pocket of one of the two girls. For the story, which is not so original (it has many similarities with the better Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The acting and the beautiful photography of Newton Thomas Sigel make this movie worth seeing. 7 out of 10 points.
