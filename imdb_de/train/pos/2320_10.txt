This film is not only a great movie for basic cinematography (script, drama, settings, etc.), but also for realism. This movie could be shown in any farm or in the countryside. It does not matter if the movie is in Louisiana or in Kansas. The story and the messages it contains remain the same. This film shows family values ​​and connections for an older audience, while showing youthful behavior for the younger audience. Anyone watching this will take something that touched them personally, I know I did. The end is too close to home for me not to cry in tears every time I see it. The end emphasizes the importance of operational safety, and anyone who has ever worked on a farm must see this movie. If you are not careful and careless, you are in dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
