How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This makes it with a nearly perfect structure. Nobody wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures also want their daughters to be chubby. Here we see a number of outstanding actors whom we have never heard of representing people of different cultures who lead a fairly normal life until their female children want and can become professional footballers. The structure of the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, both are stupid too). A shortcoming: The Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to include hundreds of relatives, but not a child.
