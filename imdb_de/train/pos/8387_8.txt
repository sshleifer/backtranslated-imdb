This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and action than Lola, but less the magic of Veronica Voss. Political considerations suggest that we see the bottlenecks after the war as the black markers could control so much of everyday life (a delicious moment in which Fassbinder tries to sell a complete set) Kleist to Schygulla, who notes that burning books Do not bring much heat: She really wants firewood. <br /> <br /> There is some awkwardness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, was to go faster. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI - I winced, it was so bad. But as the story evolves and the years pass, I am drawn more and more into this glittering, cold world.
