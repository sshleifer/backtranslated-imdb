After being forced to sit by some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy, and Lava Girl), I've really seen "Fried Worms." For once, I did not guess the end! It was funny and entertaining and, despite the title, did not take a tone of gross humor. My boys (6 and 10) both loved it too - oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile all the time on his face. This is a family movie that is not only bearable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing, just to annoy me !!" The way the new child tries to make friends, and how these friendships actually form, depends on the behavior of the children. Of course the parents have to be a little stupid - but my favorite scenes involved getting the father used to his new job. Have fun!
