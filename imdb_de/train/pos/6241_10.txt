At first I had the reaction that many people were still after seeing it: the shots of fat people sunbathing, etc. were in a way cheap shots. OK, so he meets Diane Arbus. , , What ever. , , However, it did not take long for me to realize that this is not dehumanizing as the pictures unfold. I felt that the problem was entirely for the public to sexually behaving people over a certain age is something indecent, something that should not be shown. If all this was the movie, that would be a lot. Anyway, the story of the wife with the abusive boyfriend and his drunken friend really does strike like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances and the idea that the scene is improvised. This blonde guy is a brilliant actor. Finally, I want to contradict those who say that this film is all about how pitiful all these people are. The old man, traveling with the woman who finally dances for him, is completely an OK character, breaking that mold. So do not simplify the movie by overlooking it. Yes, his dog is killed. This is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. , , completely hopeless. Nevertheless, I was really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a nice movie. I would not say that each of the threads was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this movie basically gets the ass and I highly recommend it. , ,
