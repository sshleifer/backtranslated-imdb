Since the Simpsons debuted, there was no sitcom that I did not want to shut down within 2 minutes. It was of course said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one here. <br /> <br /> The first season was such that the teenage characters were not quite as disgusting as they got later. They even went to school sometimes. In the following seasons the character was winged out. Eric, the sarcastic fool, Donna, his ambitious girlfriend, Kelso, the dim light bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the perverted exchange student, and finally Jackie, who spoiled rich bastards. The grown-up characters had Eric's mother, who "lets you think she's so cute," a suburban mother, Eric's father, the straight arrow, who was not as hard as he seemed, Donna's dumb father and hers dumb blonde mom. Everyone is loyal to their characters, but a special compliment to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between tenacity and yet sympathizes with his Red Forman without annoying us with unexpected cuteness. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. It's a difficult character because it does not allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting, such as the Kelso character competently played by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed watching the two characters interact with each other because they are the most diverse. Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because it's more realistic and we really have to see the orphaned story for the umpteenth time. Although I would like to say that the authors have had a brilliant story arc for him in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by Family Guy, vocalist Mila Kunis, is hilarious and has nails on a blackboard that really fits her character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric because they were funny together. There was too much history wasted on their relationship issues, since we already had that with Eric and Donna in the shit. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say that the casting of guest actors has always been great. Some favorites: Fez's huge friend in the mid-season, Pastor Dan, the absolutely fantastic Leo, played by another friend of Fez, Thomas Chong, who is absolutely certifiable and a special appearance of teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Next comes Fox, whatever.
