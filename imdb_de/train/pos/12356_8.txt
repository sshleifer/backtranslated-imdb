In contrast to some summaries, the women portrayed in the film are not geisha. They are Oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous entertainment districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of Tokugawa era women. I can not say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm is how typical they are. The topics are universal and commonplace: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the artistic direction and the acting. I felt like I was catching a glimpse of a time and place that I can never see otherwise. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main Oiran, were exciting. I would recommend this film only to people who want a taste of Japanese culture or those who like quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
