I was so surprised when I saw this movie so much underestimated ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. The tempo is slow, a feature of Japanese films. If you, like me, dive into the movie, you will find that this is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Shall we Dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedy. It is very different from Hollywood, eg. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, which guarantees a gag every minute. It's rather carefree, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is straightforward and yet enjoyable. I was so excited that Sugiyama (starring) found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I saw the movie, I was a bit depressed because of heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think of the beautiful side of life. I thought I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; if he could find his hobby, why should not I? It reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovering happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to know that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may not find the dance scenes as perfect as you expect, I kind of like that because I feel the characters are really "alive" and learning to dance while the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is heartening and heartwarming. Comedy makes his work perfect. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
