I'm a stunt, I have to admit, I've never seen a movie with such a good story, and no high-tech combat scene with special effects. If you like the fantastic genre like me, you will certainly be more than happy! All characters have a very cool power and the special effect is almost perfect, in one word impeccable! I will hear this movie a lot in the next few years.
