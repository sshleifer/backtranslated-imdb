This movie is just too funny, totally alien gangster. If Mel Brooks made a picture of the mob in the 1930s, it probably would. Too many great one-liners to remember, and though it's not for everyone, anyone who does not laugh a lot does not have a pulse. So, put it on and laugh at you ice holes !!!
