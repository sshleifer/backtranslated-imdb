The director was Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror film fans, after directing the seminal and infamous Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such a celebrity in the film discussed here, as it is incredibly tame in comparison and more like a Conan-inspired outing to a young audience. Such a description may be Most fans of the entire Conan-inspired Sword & Sorcery genre should be scared off right away, but before you shit your nose, it must be said that this movie is just so much fun! <br /> <br /> It is mainly laughed for playing and shows two HUGE and very likeable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. The barbarian brothers, who both seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-movie darling Richard Lynch becomes the main villain of the play and it's also great roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the ladies look stunning throughout the movie and are not well dressed (a staple and a welcome addition to the genre!). <br /> What can I say - this is just a really fun and carefree version of the genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it!
