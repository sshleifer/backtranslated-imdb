This Batman movie is not quite as good as the Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero. But it's still a good trick for the Batman cartoons. I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for the same reasons. The story is good, not quite as good as the others, but still pretty good, it has a lot of action. The cartoon effects are good. The voice of the actors is really good, like Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong like Barbra Gordon, Efrem Cymbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure you rent or buy the Batman Mystery of The Batwoman movie because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
