Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" parts on the big screen in her many years, but she is best known for the "light and fluffy" stuff with Woody Allen like Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it does not matter what the contest was in the year it was first shown. Try and find a scene where it does not appear. And it was all a heavy drama, exhausting in tempo and repetition, action, all at full speed. The make-up made her as young as possible and she even suited close-up shots in the 30s age group, but she was only half her age and very fast. Overall, the film was pretty well done, well staged and filmed with a strong minor cast, but Keaton carried the load.
