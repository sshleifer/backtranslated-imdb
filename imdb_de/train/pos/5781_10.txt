"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world in which we are exposed to the circumstances and the world within, the unconscious, a safe place to flee ..." With these words Mr. World leads of "The Maxx", a fascinating world in which imagination and reality are combined. Inspired in the comic books by Sam Kieth, "The Maxx" is very faithful to the material in what was inspired, not just in the story, but also in the graphic style that looks like the pages of the comic and this show one Show give a surreal and unique look. But the story is interesting and entertaining. In some moments it might be too funny, but once inside, it's hard to come out. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music fits in perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the right atmosphere. Like many good animated shows, this was short lived. "The Maxx" is a must. It is one of my absolute favorites.
