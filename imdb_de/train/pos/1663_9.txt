I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful movie and was fascinated by this painter I had never heard of. So I set out to explore her life and work afterwards. As expected, I realized that the film was not historically accurate. However, I was a little surprised by the film's very negative comments about this inaccuracy. Come on, people, a movie is not supposed to be a biography (or a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in itself. A film director has the right to use elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful movie, and I think it has caused many people (including some who are now giving negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
