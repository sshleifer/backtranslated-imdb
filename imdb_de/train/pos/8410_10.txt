In this truly fascinating, dark movie, a young, impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money. In return, the devil picks up his reflection (this is brilliant in the film and is forcibly predicted when the disciple Balduin comes to practice swordsmanship before the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man at war with himself" that symbolizes his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is out of reach (he has made a pact with the devil, he is forever cut off from love and other riches of the soul). You can have love or exchange your soul for money. You can not have both. Balduin is pursued by his double (the subtitles express that as well as the plot.) Some scenes are unbelievable. The feeling of destruction when the devil disappears with Balduin's reflection is astonishing, as is the feeling that his pact has forever struck him apart from human society (the scene in which he runs before his doppelganger and in the "wasteland"). On the outskirts of the city, he is no longer quite human (he has lost his soul)) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society There are so many other things to say about this incredible film: Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, a cultural hero of mine, and it helps if you know a little bit about German history at the time of this movie and about German doppelgangers tradition (do not google, get a real book) Remember, it's a very early movie, it's a bit awkward at times, but considering what it has to say and its tragic finale, it's one of the best ever (yes, is!)
