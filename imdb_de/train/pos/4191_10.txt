This 1953 Sam Fuller movie features some of his best work and it is sad that he could not get the support of the big Hollywood studios to do his stuff. The story goes something like this. On a hot summer's day, a tough, wide-bred prostitute (reading prostitute) drives in the subway and has her pocketbook selected by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the lady) does not recognize is that she also carries a microfilm, which is passed on to commiespione. This opening shot without dialogue and usually in close-ups is a beautiful, one of the many that Fuller used throughout the film. The baby known as Candy plays Jean Peters, who never looked better or better. You forget how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who has already made a name for himself. In 1947 he set the crazy crawl with the scary laugh with Kiss Of Death. Although he is a bit softer here, he is still scary. These hard-edged characters have soft spots here and there, but it's anything but evil and uncomfortable. The outstanding achievement belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, the stool, and saves her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as B-Girl (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity." Hollywood loves having a good girl go bad and loves to make her an Oscar, even though her performance is usually horrible. For example, see Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry." Between the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photographs of the great Joe MacDonald and some very good art movements. Especially good is the set that represents New York City subways and Widmarks cottage near the river The villagers of the play is at the height of the Cold War and the Red Fear an ordinary commie, played by Richard Kiley Trying to make a living Above all, earning a living is a loyal American.
