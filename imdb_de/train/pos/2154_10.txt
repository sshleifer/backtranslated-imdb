I have seen this movie many times and will never tire of it. It is a classic in the truest sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny and yet very touching at the same time. For those of you who are not fan of "subtitles" or foreign films in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's why it works), but everyone will have some of it (even if it's just a great laugh about one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters) I have never seen this!) <br /> <br /> I can not think of this movie without smiling! I love it ... and I think most people will.
