A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys is a movie you do not see every day. It has excellent actors who have an excellent history. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he holds the role as he holds John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills all humans on Earth and leaves a few hundred survival stories, but no new ones, but the story takes a new direction. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that has killed most people. <br /> <br /> The performers were great. I have to mention Brad Pitt, who was hilarious when the patient patient James Cole (Bruce) met in a psychiatric hospital. The director has done amazing work to give us a disturbing picture of a devastated future of an artificial virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the virus world felt like they were running the world when people were driven underground. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and must be seen and also a must. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
