John Travolta, the largest Honkeytonk in the world, and a mechanical bull ... what more could you ask for? Yes, in that case, you probably will not experience many surprises or deep meanings. Nevertheless, I have always enjoyed watching this romantic romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties that a hardcore redneck couple can expect. The Honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding and - of course - the necessary brawls. There is a good country soundtrack from 1980 with "Looking for Love in All Wrong Places", "The Devil Went to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" from my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break out your cowboy boots and do a boat scoop boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (from 4)
