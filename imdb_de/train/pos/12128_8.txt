Just a few days ago I saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I loved the way the music ran from Philip's foot every step of the way. It gave me goose bumps for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you see Bette Davis right before your eyes. It's awesome, not necessarily because it's her best work, but because it was so unusual to be so vicious, gloomy and fearless as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker and always wanted to be different That's right when she realized that she could be as uncomfortable and courageous as she wanted, and people would love her for it. If you're a real movie lover, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She had only one way to deliver a line that included the part and the movie. For example, "A lot of music and fire, that's me ... an old kazoo and a few sparklers" or "But you're Blanche, you're in this chair!" or "WITH ALL OF MY HEART I LOVE THE MAN THAT I KILL!" ... These are some of her films, but you get my drift. She was just so brave, cheeky and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was repeated twice ... Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and enduring that you had to be loved. I found that he was adorable and could not understand that not everyone fell for him, but on the other hand, everyone ... except Mildred. He did a great job. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was something that was common in writing in the early films. They would make a character so hateful that it is almost unbelievable that someone actually falls in love with him. The performances were great, but in real life Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. That's just the simple truth ... Look!
