Half a dozen short stories of varying interest inform us about life in Finland. These stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sound boom can be heard. This indicates that the events presented are taking place at the same time. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bungy jump that promises some excitement, but the early stories are quite restrained. The movie is improving, so stick with it. Two broken marriages in the following stories cause a lot of drama, while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> While the different scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are general in all places where you live. <br /> Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a well-tense, 90-minute drama.
