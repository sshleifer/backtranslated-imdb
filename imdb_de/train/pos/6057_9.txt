Sure, it's a great imagery and a fantastic sound. It's a great show-off home theater disc, but it's also a moving drama and informative documentary. The parallel stories intertwined in this film will interest all viewers. Young, old, boys and girls will find that deep inside. We're all fans of the car, especially the powerful Indy machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The soundtrack of Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder is perfectly matched to the appearance and content. I would not want to reveal the end, but the final drive sequence to Quincy Jones "Days Like These" could bring you a tear. Enjoy it!
