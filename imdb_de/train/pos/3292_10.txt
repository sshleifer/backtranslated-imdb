Paperhouse is the most moving and moving movie I have ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie", this is, I think, a grave mistake. Some journos once called it "the nightmare of the thinking person on Elm Street," and although I accept the logic of its conclusion, I can not help thinking that it is a label that is poorly earned and misleading. Those who can only see horror are really missing here and only serve to show that they really do not think. In fact, it is only a bad idea to try to classify this wonderful work. Paperhouse is simply perfect in every exquisite detail and always has a special place in my heart. Someone smarter than me once said, "The film hits you on a completely emotional level," which may help explain why my comments bubble so relentlessly. To be honest, I do not apologize for that. If you feel that my words are too saccharine for your liking, stop reading now because more is to be expected. His heart is the pain and pain of childhood and the struggle, the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness overcome, which can completely overwhelm us in this fragile time in our lives. Even more uncommon is to find child actors who can actually play their part with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make everything work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers, we had an inspired piece of casting, and Paperhouse's continued impact owes its ability to seamlessly and convincingly portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked). <br /> <br /> And yet, both brilliant young stars seemed to have gone through the studios and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add all this to an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), a resourceful movie art and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you'll ever hear, and you'll probably get an idea of ​​why I'm one have such affection and affinity for this film that can not express a lot of words. <br /> <br />
