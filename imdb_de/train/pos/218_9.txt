Walter Matthau and George Burns take over the roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, and play some old-time vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who have a different way of life /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take his time and smell the roses. He's a shrill old man whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him a lot was that his partner, George Burns, decided to retire 15 years earlier and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not understand this and personally make Burn's decision. Benjamin meets a brainstorm, brings the boys back together and does it in a national TV special. What happens here is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are also a sad, bittersweet story about old age. Matthau can be seen on screen for most of the film, but it's Burns who, at the ripe old age of 79, received the Kudos in the form of an Oscar. Burns brought something personal in this movie with good. As we all know, he was the direct man of Burns & Allen's wonderful comedy team, from whom the Monty Python troupe borrowed a lot. For health reasons Gracie Allen retired in 1958 and George was close to 100 years old. Or at least as an active performer pretty close. However, the Sunshine Boys are based on the Smith & Dale team, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend that you watch Two Tickets to Broadway to see some guys who entertain the American public at the turn of the last century to have. The doctor sketch by Matthau and Burns comes directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you will like The Sunshine Boys.
