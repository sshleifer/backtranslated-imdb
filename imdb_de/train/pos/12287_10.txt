Although the story is fictional, it refers not only to the history of the Latin American countries, but to the entire Third World. This is the true, pure and raw recent history of these countries, which is briefly summarized in this novel / film. The unconventional supernatural stuff highlights the intensity of historical events in this film. After all, the supranatural stuff is part of Third World culture. Although not critically acclaimed (probably because of the supranatural criterion), this is a great movie with a great story and great acting.
