actually ... this "video camera" effect is just an effect, a pretty good one. (You do not know much about directing a movie, right?) It's great fun to watch, made for television, and no rules have to be followed. I find it difficult to watch number one because he kills the first girl, it is disturbing. and all the time we're doing for Judd Nelson to get away with it, we're on his side as spectators. I hope one day we will see a third cabin by the lake, but I doubt it. When you watch this movie, you can understand how real films are made, because it's like a movie inside a movie. Judd is one of the scariest villains of all time, and he is more realistic. He does not just hack people like other horrors.
