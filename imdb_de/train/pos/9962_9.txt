I was a bit scared to see this movie because of its prices. But living in Italy has never encountered titles like this, and I love Step so much that I decided to give it a try. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning". It is touching and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused and AWARE of her talent (and talent has Rutina Wesley, my chin has fallen in the recent dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is frankly inspiring. The fact that she is not the typical, super-sharp woman (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good job. Really good. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance routines are just sick.
