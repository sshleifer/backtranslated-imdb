This is a wonderful movie. The uninterrupted pattern needs several observations to fully appreciate it. The musical productions of Busby Berkeley are never duplicated. I think this movie easily surpasses its other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are amazing together. Part of the humor would almost go beyond the limits of today's films. Provide a rational explanation for how they did it, and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.
