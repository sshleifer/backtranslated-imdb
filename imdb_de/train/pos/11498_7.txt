"Kolchak: The Night Stalker" is a hugely entertaining TV series in which an obtrusive, sarcastic reporter just over forty is repeatedly drawn into the lethal fight with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of Kolchak character TV movies, this series died quickly in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it still has a strong cult today. But will the average modern viewer be able to dig up Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> This is actually a difficult question that needs to be answered fairly. Critics of this series tend to argue that it is formulaic and hopelessly outdated. On the other hand, fans say it's clever, well-played and sometimes really scary. And me? I have a foot in both camps. I have enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD lately, although I can clearly see that the show has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> I will first discuss the question that Kolchak is "fiction". I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - every episode of Columbo follows the same pattern. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that the audience enjoys frequent repetitive entertainment and is actively seeking. The problem with Kolchak, however, is that his formula is simply too rigid - even at the most generous scales it is too repetitive. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and finds that he was being committed by some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about this monster, but his editor Vincenzo blocks him, always on the grounds that Kolchak has not enough evidence to support his claim that supernatural powers work. And unfortunately Kolchak is also hampered by the police. At the end, Kolchak researches the monster himself, finds out how to kill it ... and then kills it. Without a ceremony or reward or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this so-severe formula could get tired, right? I am especially confused by Vincenzo - if Kolchak always gushes about monsters and Vincenzo never believes ... Well, why does not Vincenzo fire or kill Kolchak? Any normal boss would do that. But the series renounces such a realism and prefers to consider Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are unbelievably incredible - though they're pretty funny too. <br /> <br /> The best episodes of Kolchak manage to overcome the limitations of this formula, but mostly because they contain a kind of unexpected twist. These selected episodes are good enough that I think they are largely immune to typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites are: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that's remarkable because it's dingy, resourceful, and socially aware. Kolchak's dialogue is unusually sharp and cynical. Although it sticks closely to the Kolchak formula, the script (written by Jimmy Sangster, veteran of Hammer Studios) is remarkably legible and delves deep into the monster's backstory. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform - a possible inspiration for the "Omen" movies, I notice this episode because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - seduces Kolchak with a satanic treat full of goodies Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation with the fans, but I enjoyed it because it's a great red herring and a really scary, almost unstoppable one Monster has. <br /> <br /> Although I 've picked out these three episodes of praise, I would say most of the stories are at least entertaining. For my money, there are only two complete 20-sequence turkeys: Primal Scream, which is about ape people in Chicago, and Sentry, which offers the stupidest creature make-up in the history of filmed entertainment (and this Assessment comes from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan!) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a good series. A little repetitive, maybe a bit cheesy, but it has elements of size. Even during the weaker episodes, Darren McGavin's wonderful performance shines as the caustic, world-weary, endlessly funny Kolchak. He effortlessly wears the series in a way that Sarah Michelle Gellar never did on "Buffy". McGavin was a great character actor, and this series is worthwhile for him alone.
