Do not go into revolvers and expect another snatch or lock stick. This is a different kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala the other day and this movie definitely split the audience. It's a kind of movie where half the audience thinks, WHAT was it? That was terrible, and the other half will go and think, WHAT was that? That was cool. I personally like movies that I do not understand, d. H. Mullholland Drive, and Usual Suspects, so I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I have seen that the big turn was a mile away, at least part of it, and though sometimes some unexplained loose ends are good, Revolver leaves many questions unfounded without there being a reason to do so. Also, some scenes, like the animation, and the scene where sorters go to a killer pile (actually one of my favorites), even though it seemed to be fantastic scenes that were just there because they were great to look at, not because they did fit with the movie. <br /> <br /> But there were also many good things. I found the acting great of all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This movie definitely caught my interest, with one great, thrilling, action-packed scene after another. When Ray Liotta was held under the table, wow ... well, you have to see it. The script was very well done, and the soundtrack, as with most Guy Ritchie movies, was great. <br /> <br /> Although it was one step below such films as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still a fast-paced, fast-paced, psychological action movie with lots of twists and countless scenes to go on for a long time will be remembered after the movie.
