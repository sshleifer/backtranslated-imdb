Buddy is an entertaining family movie that takes place at a time when animals have been "humanized" and making them cute has been an accepted way to get people interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and each other, and that they will do everything for each other. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is pretty realistic most of the time. Chaos that occurs in the home is usually amusing for kids. <br /> <br /> This film ignores the opportunity to deal with the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but shows the difficulties. <br /> <A recommended movie that was first for Jim Henson Productions.
