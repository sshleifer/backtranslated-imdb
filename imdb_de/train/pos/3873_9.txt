This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The flash is absolutely great and the colors convincingly remind Vermeer paintings. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy that goes far beyond American and French standards and is probably better than English. <br /> <br /> Each character touches and the interpretation is near perfect. Isabelle Blais is great, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in this strange role of him, and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could get away for hours before finding a negative comment on this movie. Give it a chance and add your own review.
