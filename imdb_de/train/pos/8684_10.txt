This is one of the first and best Columbos with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared in another Columbo as well as several bad guys, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. <br /> <br /> In this case, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair, so he instructs Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail business on the side, so he gives Milland a fake report and threatens Crowley with the real one if she does not get paid. In Culps house there is a fierce fight, and she is murdered. Come to Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp is doing everything to get Columbo out of the way, including offering a job, but Columbo is ready to help him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Excellent episode.
