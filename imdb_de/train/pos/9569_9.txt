As I understand it, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the notorious cat. 3 Hong Kong movies disappeared somehow. At least until now and what an amazing movie this movie is. I knew it was a rough crime drama, but to be the first cat. 3 I bought what was done recently. I was not sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian goes to Hong Kong to shake off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer. It turned out that the judge had made arrangements for the batsman because she divorced the judge and threatened to take all his money. All this is known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is wasted. After the strike, the cops find the batsman pretty fast, but several policemen and civilians are killed in an attempt to arrest him. He escapes the police and now is the race to catch the guy before he flees to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops and barely gives the viewer the chance to catch their breath. Yes, it is very violent and violent, many policemen are killed, because the Hitman proves to be very hard to find if he finds him. While trying to hide in a dump, the man finds a woman being raped and abused by a man. He helps her and rescues her from the guy, and she persuades the batsman to take her with him when he flies. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster ride that moves and moves at high speed as one incident leads to the next and the police are sometimes as bad or worse as the hitman. The acting is exceptionally good, and the filming and photos of the locations are sometimes breathtaking. In this movie, there is no easing, not even with the very incredible end. The end is quite incredible and also a fitting end to all acts and acts of violence. Yes, the violence is sometimes brutal, but this is a very uncomplicated crime drama that will tear your socks off. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a wider release, including an R1 version. Great movie, highly recommended.
