Here's a sketchy revenge story with the bad guys starring a ruthless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a dried-up former mercenary, a loving paternal guy for a little girl, and then a brutal maniac in search of answers and revenge. <br /> The story is about Washington, a bodyguard for a little American girl, who lives in Mexico, is engaged. There kidnappings of children are carried out regularly (at least according to film) actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after those responsible and spares no one. Attention: This movie is not for squeamish. <br /> <br /> This is stylish filmmaking that is good and bad. I liked it, but some people found it too hectic for their taste, as the camera work can be a headache. I thought it suited the tense story and was fascinating to look at, but it's not (the rickety camera) for all tastes. Besides the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, who is atypical of low-key role and a number of other good actors. <br /> <br /> The movie flatters the basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
