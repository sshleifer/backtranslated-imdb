This movie was excellent, I thought that the original movie was rather mediocre. However, this had all the ingredients, a 1970s Hemi Challenger with 4-speed gearbox, which shows that Mother Mopar could build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski blocked that big block, and he sure did that a lot :)
