A fabulous movie. With everything you want for a movie. Huge fight scenes and lots of action. Tension and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> A bit like an old Swashbuckler movie. Absolutely entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you never get bored. The story is like a classic problem story in the royal household. The actors are beautiful and the sets are great. The costumes are spectacular and the stunts are resourceful. The special effects are also incredible. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive and beautiful as an actor. He looks like a safe bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand, is excellent and perfect for the lead actress, though she plays with an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I've found out that the movie has won numerous awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an amazing independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give a TEN + !!!
