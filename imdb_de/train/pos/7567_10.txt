An excellent film that shows the cross-currents in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of less ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid directing and writing as well as good acting, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was shot in the same year as the very successful "Crash" by Paul Haggis. The tempo of the plot may not be as hectic as Los Angeles, and the characters seem to be better known to each other in "Beyond That," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and distressed as their stories are as resonant as all in "crash". For the spectators who appreciate "Crash", this film is a must. Fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will also like this movie.
