The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are great supporting roles in characters, both of whom have more than what appears at first glance. Jean Simmons is pretty good, and Trevor Howard makes a fascinating, unusual suspension hero.
