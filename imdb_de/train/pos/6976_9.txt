I did not see BSG, I tried to see it in the middle of the show, but I could not deal with it. Yesterday I saw Caprica Rebirth. I felt a little lost, so I decided to look at the pilot today, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show, and the only side effect that it had on me is that I now also want to see BSG. <br /> <br /> But I really liked that I did not have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what's going on in Caprica. From what I've read on the net, they've been trying to reach the female population since BSG has reached far more men, and at least in my case, it worked. <br /> <br /> But I suggest you try it. To see how the show starts from the beginning, starting with the pilot.
