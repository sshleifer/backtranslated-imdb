Although I'm quite young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I never had the opportunity to listen to their music when it was released, but I have loved them since I can remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that's worth trying. I can see why it was not released in the cinema, but it's certainly a great movie that can be shown on TV. I flipped through my TV Guide and saw this movie by accident. He did not have many details except something like 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the Beatles' Jared Harris Stars' disband. I'd never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn playing Paul. However, they are certainly underrated actors! <br /> <br /> The movie got off to a slow start, but as it progressed, I saw how well Quinn, and above all Harris, played their characters. As a big fan, I somehow know what the real Lennon and McCartney look like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and behaviors perfect! Quinn played McCartney pretty well, but sometimes went into his Irish accent. The make-up artists made her look great. <br /> <br /> THIS SELL CAN BE COUNTED AS * SPOILER *: As I mentioned earlier, it had a slow start developing fast and became an emotional movie. I found the play in the park a total waste of time for both musicians and rather untypical. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, it's completely unnecessary. The end was very moving and always brings a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It's quite different from the other biographical films I've seen, where The Beatles came together and became famous. and they never did the characters so well. For example, 'Backbeat'. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, I'd say give him a chance to have a pleasant surprise. With only about 95 minutes, it pays to wait for the development of the film. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting actually took place, please send it to the comment page for this movie, I would be very interested.
