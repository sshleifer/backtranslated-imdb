To be honest, if someone told me that the director of Lemony Snicket's series of unfortunate events, City of Angels and Caspers, would make a decent little low-budget indie movie and that would be really good, I would say that person Must be a joke But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has similar insights to films like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or recently "Once". There is a chance that two people might meet who, if they had not been laid there by chance, would probably never cross the path, or if they did, they would not say a word to each other. Like these films, "10 Items or Less" focuses on the relationship that is built and how the characters understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story implies that Morgan Freeman plays a role Unnamed actor who explores his role as a grocery store agent for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control the day with the lady in the 10 or less Traces of Paz Vega spends. She has a lazy marriage and hopes to get a new job as a secretary. Freeman's character only needs a lift home in the beginning. After spending time with her, he wants to meet her and maybe even give her advice. Brad Siberling builds the characters almost exclusively through the exchange between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just a setup for these two characters to interact with each other during most of the 80 minutes of the movie. Freeman enjoys his character because he seems to be an underdog in the underclass world where Vegas character Scarlett lives. In the meantime, Vega is growing beyond the stubborn cashier who is angry at the situation in her life that wants to move on. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that really caught the eye in this movie. Siberling has most likely taken notice of independent cinema to make sure that the relationship is straightforward and does not fall into any pitfalls of Hollywood. It's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the movie. It works, even if the situation itself seems a bit unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I'm also impressed by the performances. While Freeman's presence makes this movie believable from the beginning, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun that he does not normally see. Meanwhile, Paz Vega is preparing for a breakthrough in US film. I loved her in Spanglish, and she's as good as the tough noisy Scarlet. Towards the end of the film, she successfully conveys the growth of her character. I'm looking forward to seeing her in more movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 items of less work best as a character piece, well scanned and directed by Brad Siberling. He did not write much and his feature films mainly consisted of big Hollywood movies. However, there is certainly an artist working here and I am curious to see if he will take this path again.
