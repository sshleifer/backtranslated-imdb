After reading many of the other reviews on the IMDb movie, there seems to be a consensus among purists that this film does not fit the books it's based on. I can not comment on that, as I had never read any of the protagonist adventures before. What I can say with certainty, however, is that I notice that many of the said reviewers must certainly have gone through a humor bypass; To be honest, this movie is just so much fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? ... so I have to admit the point that the movie does not seem to be representative of the characters clear perspective ?? Do the same individuals who are upset about this film complain that the classic Batman series from the 1960s does not remain true to the original DC comic book character? Or is there perhaps still unrest in the same people that the 1980s film version of Flash Gordon deviates too much from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is unbelievably stocky, but that's the charm! <br /> <br /> The former Tarzan, Ron Ely, plays the eponymous hero here (and has more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey!) and is supported by a great side cast who all look like a ball with their respective roles to have. Also pay close attention to a very short, but very welcome performance by horror movie favorite Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Far too many to choose from, but look at the funny expressions the waiter has accepted as Savage and his men make the ultimate fake order of Coke, Lemonade and Milk on an official occasion! Also the often-known scene at the end of the film, in which Savage fights his Nemesis Captain Seas with various martial arts disciplines labeled on the canvas! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> In short, the movie does not take itself seriously and is all the more fun. Great fun from start to finish! (and you are guaranteed to sing the title song adapted to John Phillip Sousa, guaranteed to sing a few days later!)
