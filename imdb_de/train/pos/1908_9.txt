This show is beautifully done. When it first came out, it was nothing but a light-hearted family comedy with lots of good ones. It also seemed to express many families very well, with different concepts of parent and child. However, as I said, I never thought of having a good watch in one evening. My view, however, was shot from the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically witty John Ritter occurred. The program stood on the ground, praising the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way, which also touched the hearts of all the admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. When the show aired after Ritters was over, I absolutely wanted to hug my dad and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought that light cast the theatrical talents of the three children, especially Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words she told him. It reminded me that no matter what terrible things I say to my father, I do not mean her and it is very important that he knows that. Great show
