This "tragicomedy" by the famous Serbian theater and film author Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. Yet his appearance of a play transformed into a movie does not detract from its value. A masterpiece that you should not miss (preferably with subtitles and not synchronized). <br /> <br /> In an old bus on the way to the capital Belgrade, a threatening war determines the behavior of the passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing about their wretched life, but also foresee a tragedy for the future; Their vocals share and connect stages in this extraordinary road movie (the real Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a peasant who paved the road, they provide a real performance). <br /> <br /> The Spectrum The characters give a brilliant picture of a society facing war and insight into the collective person of a nation: Everyone knows that the war is just beginning, but they are trying their hand at it to live one's life as well as possible, and hope that ignorance can avert the tragedy. In a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan draws a picture of the society that was torn apart in the previous war (World War I), but also personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the veteran of the First World War on the way to his recently confiscated son and bleak predictions of a man who seems to be a German spy. Brilliant in his narrative, with a catchy soundtrack (especially the Gispsy songs) and customized atmosphere photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's feature film debut) was just an introduction to a series of bitter-sweet comedies by the directors, the Serbian cinematic of the 80s "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota" and the favorite of my other director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
