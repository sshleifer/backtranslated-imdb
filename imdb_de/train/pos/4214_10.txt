The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Forbidden!), Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie, Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best Movie Noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. Of course I like him when he's out of control, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark plays a pickpocket stealing microfilm designed for communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who wore the movie for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get him back. She finds him through a chair dove by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peter's loyalty (that and the fact that she finds out she works for Communists, the Cold War stuff is really interesting.) The love story is a bit quick and not entirely believable, but it does not so bad as to hurt the movie (unlike Fuller's previous movie Park Row) Richard Widmark is great, this must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I'm sure Thelma Ritter offers the most memorable performance, her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as anything you find in the cinema, I'll never forget that.
