I always enjoy this movie when it is shown on TV. <br /> <br /> The one scene that always strikes me is the one with Myrna Loy and the painter, where they enthusiastically give explicit instructions on the colors and once they're gone, he turns his boys around and says "Did you understand that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"
