A wild, shockingly intelligent work by talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best he has ever done). It's about intelligent people whose lives do not mean much. They have wasted what they were given and are mostly empty vessels. The only character on the canvas who lives is the mother of the title, but she feels inwardly dead until a rough craftsman shows her affection and wakes her to the pleasures of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with great compassion. This is a movie in which people and places feel familiar, in which characters exist outside the boundaries of the screen. In some ways, it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," but it's a harder piece of work overall. The director Roger Michell instinctively build scenes. And it is played beautifully. <br /> <br /> When the mother of the same name, Anne Reid, reveals her wasted life in every gesture. There is no false note in her extraordinary performance, and this very good actor Daniel Craig shows his character shades that even Kureishi has not touched. If the film hits a false mark, it may be in the character of the talentless daughter involved in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should it be the other way around) and even a messy life, but she is well played by Cathryn Bradshaw, that she still captivates you. The film is also extremely nice to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must without hesitation be classified as the best British film of the year.
