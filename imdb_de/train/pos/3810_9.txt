This is my first review on IMDb, I did not really want to write, but since there are only two for this great movie, I feel compelled to include my perspective ... and no, I'm not affiliated with the movie filmmaker in any way (yeah yeah, how many times have you done that before ;-)) FYI I'm in my late 20s. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to admit that I really like animated films, because what you see is limited only by the imagination of the creators, and they were quite resourceful. Not so much in terms of history, but to achieve a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good, but they are anything but real and work well for the movie, after all, it's a fairytale world. The backgrounds and the world in general, however, are filled with impressive visuals that have taken me several times while watching. The blue, bunny-style mini-dragon steals the show and easily has some of the movie's funniest moments. He is already an instant classic, much like Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and kill the biggest dragon imaginable), but who cares if the movie looks so good and sounds so good ;-) The movie is not suitable for VERY little children as it contains some dark scenes and may be scary for children under 6 to 8 years old. I would say these are very few scenes, but imo worth mentioning. Anyway, I had a great time watching this and cant wait for the High Def stores to go over and over again just for the sake of the beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
