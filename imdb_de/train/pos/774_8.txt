I think it's a nice movie. I think it is a very Romanian film through scenery and atmosphere. I think it should not be sensual (sensuality is a result, not an end). I think it's very natural. I think it's human. I think it was interesting. I think the actors never made me think. I think the movie has reached its goal. I think I made things feel (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... I know that.
