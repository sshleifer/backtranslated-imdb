Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to my mind when people (at least people who could do that) sit here and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> But some of the best films in the genre "Out of the Past," "The Killers," "In A Lonely Place," "Night and the City," create a level of sleek sophistication that lifts them beyond a moody phrase and its connotations of gloomy shadows, fedora and femme-fatales. <br /> <br /> "Where the Sidewalk", a rather hard-to-find movie - the only copy of perhaps the best-stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel - is in a category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud of opening credits is over, a curtain pulls around the terrible loner-detective Marc Dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it's getting closer and threatening Suffocation. <br /> <br /> Sure, he's so familiar with "Cop with a dark past," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a bleak look and a distressed intensity that makes her as uncomfortable as he seems. And yes, he has been hanging out with suspects for too long, and the recently promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically tough and commanding round) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates these clubs too much to stop now. And boy, did not they let it come? "Hoods, feather dusters, cups, gutter nickel rats," he spits as a boss's teaser nudges him and triggers all the discomfort the office has gotten over Dixon's right hook. The advice is that he should cool down for his own good. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and draws on a nature that may or may not have been shared by a generation before. <br /> <br /> Immediately he is deep in the bulls, the syndicate and his own partner. Dixon's dubious involvement in a "murder investigation" threatens his job, and he wonders if he's just a base like the one he swore. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place," can he "escape what he is?" If he can not turn nowhere, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney), who seems to believe the existence of his infertile bachelor to make a home that is worth to come home to. <br /> <br /> The pace of this great movie is tense and exciting. The group of authors who contributed to the production has brought the script to a high gloss - the dialogue is snappy, without dissolving into an old parode-food, passionately, without becoming melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And all that top-notch direction and acting is not too smooth or polished to lessen the movie's emotional hold. Gene Tierney's angelic soft-focus beauty is used with great effect. She shows herself as an actress of considerable scope, and her gentle, friendly nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in Leave Her to Heaven. The scenes between Tierney and Andrews Dixon become more intense and touch the closer he comes to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> At the bottom of his rope, Dixon saps, shatters, exhausted and depletes his fate: "Innocent people can also end up in terrible jams ..." he says. "One wrong move and you're over your head." <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so intriguing might be the feeling that things could go wrong for just about anyone - especially someone who tries so hard to walk properly - with a slight wind movement Decision or a wrong blow or, most frightening, due to factors over which you have no control. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears and brought them to the surface. "Where the sidewalk ends" does this in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (A niche pick from one side: This otherwise sophisticated movie has an incredibly poor dub of a blonde model who would not seem inappropriate at Mystery Science Theater.) How strange.) <br /> <br /> But noir fans - all movie fans - who have not seen this movie yet, will have a grandiose treat.
