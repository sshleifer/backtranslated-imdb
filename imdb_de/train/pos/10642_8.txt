Yesterday I was in detention and I liked what I saw. It was a cool, funny movie. Dolphin looked super cool on the bike. He also looked good in this film compared to his other current films. He's in pretty good shape now. I would not call this movie his best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But he also had his share of problems. The first was the way bullets flew everywhere, and even if they fired from close range, they missed the target. Another problem I had was the way the students swore. I do not know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys had very few. There should have been more bad guys. The last problem was definitely the fact that the set looked cheesy, but that was because of the small budget. Overall, the movie was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I would recommend to others to look at him. P.S. Now you're a dead beat cop. (Some one-liners were cool too) <br /> <br />
