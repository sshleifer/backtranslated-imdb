The film by Artemisia can be considered a betrayal or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> What could you say? <br /> <br /> In the documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew and still confirmed that she was annoyed as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem has eloquently confirmed it. <br /> <br /> In the film, she refused under another torture to condemn her lover / transgressor. How can a film deviate so much from the history it has received? still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not that hard to find. In the film, the director and the actors had filled a gaping hole with imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion that is different from the plate. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find both the record and the film captivating. <br /> <br /> Both in the film and in the story, Artemisia was above all a painter. <br /> <br /> For I'm really thankful for this vision, embedded in a fascinating (sic) movie composition. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a movie that has so fascinated my eyes.
