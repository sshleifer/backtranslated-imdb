The Haunting is a movie that offers a really scary house, good effect work and sound work, a cast that seems to think that everything around them is real and this house. There are scenes that make you jump, and I found the eerie aspects of what happened in Hill House in the past interesting. There are really scary moments in the movie, and I liked how the spirits manifested in sheets, curtains and in the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score provided the right atmosphere and the sound design made voices appear around you. What I would have liked would be something more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating and I think he was holding back a bit too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still lasts. The Haunting could have used a few scenes of pure terror. The end was a little anti-climactic for me. Overall, I liked it. The spectacle is good and there are moments when you can jump. I just wish I was more scared.
