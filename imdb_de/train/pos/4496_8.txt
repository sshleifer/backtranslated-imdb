Simply put, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was nothing other than the object itself. I had heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how the life and attitudes of the working class in Northern England (as they experienced it) have been. This is an interesting account that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular, the paternalistic but presumptuous father who "knows" what is best for his family and his stubbornness when challenged by this paradigm. (Not much has changed then !!) <br /> <br /> People who have seen the play are likely to be disappointed with the movie as the story can not be easily transmitted across the different media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document, and I personally enjoyed it, if only because of the way it conveys a social phenomenon.
