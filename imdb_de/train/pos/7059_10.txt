I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I have seen on the internet. I thought Cinderella 2 (and also 3) was a very nice and funny sequel for all - kids and adults ... like me I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I think so too and a very informative film that shows how to stay true to yourself and follow your heart. I thought it had great animation and the voice casting was very good. the songs of Brooke Allison, too. Since this film has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite scene is the story when Jaq became a human being for one day thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
