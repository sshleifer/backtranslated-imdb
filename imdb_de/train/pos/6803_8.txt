In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as a young Queen Victoria of Britain, when she is suddenly put on the throne at 18, despite the machinations of politicians learn to govern and finally marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though surprisingly true to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about British kings in German contributes to its quaint charm. In this regard, one wonders why an Austrian film was shot about an English queen. But then one remembers that in 1954 Austria was still occupied by Allied troops, including the British. Maybe that was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
