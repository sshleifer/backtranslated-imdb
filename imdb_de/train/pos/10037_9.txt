The ship may have fallen, but the movie is not !!! Director James Cameron of "The Terminator" has made it again with this amazing image. One of my favorite scenes is the 'The Table' scene where Roses's family and friends meet Jack after he rescues her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when she meets "THE ONE" ... I hope I have that look when I'm in the room with my future husband. I have a connection called "MOVIE STUFF "is, but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mother and all her elite employees who live on her husband's fortune. Rose almost commits suicide, but the star of Gilbert Grape rescues her. I really liked the hanging scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actor !!! Take a look at it twice, if you want, it's worth it !!!
