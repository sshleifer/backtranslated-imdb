I know anime. I've been busy for a long time before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was all about. And just so you know I'm not bragging about my let me say this: Of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say spirited away is the best, but I really do not agree. Most people only know this movie because it's an Acedmy Award; This is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to the people who have seen Spirited Away so far, and they agree that the latter two are superior to the three. Personally, I never thought anything would be comparable to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the Prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easy to equate with; In many ways, Castle has important elements that Mononoke has missed. If you've just seen Spirited Away and think that this is Miyazaki's best movie, you should prepare for shaking your Earth.
