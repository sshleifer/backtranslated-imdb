What a great movie! It was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice turns of the plot, interesting characters, very good direction and a surprising ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror movie that may not be appealing to non-horror fans but still (nevertheless) one of the best thrillers ever! I recommend it ONLY Fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or an actress. <br /> *** ***************************************************** ************************************************** ** ... You know, they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". If I'm not mistaken, SCREAM also copies other movies! In fact, almost every horror movie has copied an earlier one. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> GO AND RENT THIS! <br /> <br />
