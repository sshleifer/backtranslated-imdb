Contrary to popular belief, this title is not that bad for me at least. Actually. I consider it a popular movie of all time. Welding stories was not well structured when you consider the differences between the series. Nevertheless, you can see it pretty happy. For a movie of its time, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable. <br /> <br /> The audio / audio track is a personal favorite of mine. Almost everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices fit the characters much better than their now-bad-cast US dub counterparts. The synchronization is perfect in every shot. I had some casting problems for the "alien" voices (please forgive the raw name, it's been a while since I saw it). Otherwise, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this film. Dubs are often an issue that I seldom agree with so long ago. I loved the OSDs of yesteryear, but the castings often shut down series. <br /> <br /> At this point I would like to add that this was one of the first animes I have seen in my life. It has a historical value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it stayed stronger and was seen more in my collection. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, the title in Texas only came to the US. Personally, I find it a pity. If the right audience had been affected, I think Robotech the Movie has been accepted over the years and not tarnished. I'm busy with anime every day in my life and everyone I've shown this movie thought it was a beautifully composed title. When looking at the film for its individual components, the viewer will be able to see the obvious action holes between the shows. Without seeing the originals, however, the viewer would not really notice. Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it at the time. The United Kingdom had very limited access to anime. Laser plates were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Carl had the balls to at least promote the genre. I mean, Harmony would not spend the money on the show to be released. <br /> <br /> Despite the few picky mistakes that people had with this film, the feeling of the eighties keeps me in my mind. Now if you look at Megazone 23, the original Japanese sound or the new Dub, I think you will be very disappointed with the OSD. Think of the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine the new 80's sound for E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Say it all. The popularity of this movie today is most likely due to its rarity in the free market. Personally, it has produced a collection for me. Now I am looking for the whole world for goods from the three components of which it was made. If I ever meet Carl Macek, I shake my hand and take the trouble to buy him a pint or a box to bring me to the anime.
