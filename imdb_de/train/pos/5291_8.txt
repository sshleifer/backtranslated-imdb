It's only been a week since I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble), and I was not sure what to expect the second time around. <br /> <br /> While the previous movie was outrageously overstated, Pecker is actually a funny movie that makes the art critics in New York a satire. Anyone who can not imagine what these "experts" are so attracted to modern art will enjoy inspiring these overbearing snobs about Pecker Boy, who has just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good at Pecker. There was not much meat on the rolls in this movie, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex and Pecker.). Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, also played an important role in the film's fun. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny scenes, but I have to say, the best part is when a crown screams: "We want bush!" "We want bush!" "We want bush!" I thought it was a Republican rally until I saw the police pull the dancer away. <br /> <br /> I will now have to look for Waters' work, especially Hairspray. In the News.
