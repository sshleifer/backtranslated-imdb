The horror films of the thirties that are best remembered are always Dracula and Frankenstein; There is a very good reason for that, but there have been a number of smaller, yet outstanding, productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot is not very original and similar actions have been seen many times (even before 1936), but the way it's put together is certainly very inventive and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very pretty little original horror movie. The plot focuses on the kind-hearted Dr. Janos Rukh; a man who has found a way to redesign Earth's history. His discovery makes him believe that there is an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa, so he sets out with a team of respected colleagues to find it. During the expedition the tragedy hits and the good doctor is finally exposed to the element. what makes him shine in the dark and makes him crazy ... <br /> <br /> The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that he leads the two biggest horror stars of his time - Boris Karloff and Bela - Lugosi and both perform excellently. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has a lot of meat for Karloff, with whom he can impress. Bela Lugosi has a very different role than we normally have, and it's also a great achievement for him; It's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi. The movie starts quite slowly; but things are starting to catch up soon. The second half of the movie is the best and then the movie gets really exciting and Karloff gets a chance (literally) to shine. The film does not focus on large special effects and depends largely on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting. and it works very well. The movie remains consistently interesting and runs to a very neat climax, which completes everything nicely. Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the best horror movies of the 1930s; but it is a very good one and is recommended.
