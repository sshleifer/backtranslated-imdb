Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just watch for fun. It is not a pleasant experience, although there are some loud moments. This is a movie to watch as you think. <br /> <br /> To reject this movie as simply racist, you have to miss the point altogether. This is not only a satire of the Song of the South, but also a sharp commentary on the prejudices Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film is portrayed as a grotesque caricature of its stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these strict beliefs really are. If you are the kind of person who is willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the widespread prejudices of American culture, and if you are not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye, this movie might be for you.
