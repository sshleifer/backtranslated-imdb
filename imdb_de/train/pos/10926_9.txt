If you love kung fu movies and have not seen this movie, cheat yourself. This movie is one of the few kung fu shoppers that can be recommended to fans of all kinds of movies. It usually takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see everything in these films, but it has it all! The story is well told and complete. The fight scenes are great and tend to end before you are completely bored (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw a little secret and torture and you have filmed like a movie. See this under all circumstances. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu you! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 <br /> <br />
