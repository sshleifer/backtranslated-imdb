In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer firefighters leads to Brodie's famous bet that he can leap from the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story many people will get to know through a 1949 Bugs Bunny parody "Bowery Bugs." <br /> <br /> This generally very entertaining movie would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and disturbing scene that involved some Chinese resident dwellers - a time capsule with antediluvian racial attitudes that the film in my view very much makes interesting.
