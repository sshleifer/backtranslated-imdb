This film moves without being sentimental - meaningful without being presumptuous. It tells a simple story of a family at risk of breakup as technology interference and an emerging society make the family business increasingly unsustainable. <br /> <br /> The action is wonderful - although none of us in the West has probably heard of these actors we should have had it a long time ago - they play their characters with honesty and awe - these are flawed characters, which all have great weaknesses, but with such extreme humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to engage the story. <br /> <br /> We need more films like this - we need more Western filmmakers to make such films.
