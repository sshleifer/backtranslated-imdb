20 of 10 This is a really wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is quartered with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious problems when he wets his bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow the two find solace in the loneliness of others. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing performance of Jerusalem. William is friends with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish boy, also from London. Together with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and feels part of this small, close community. Just as he settles down, William is called back to London by his mother, and here we see why he is so broken. His mother is obviously mentally ill and when Tom hears nothing of William, he travels to London to look for him. He finally finds himself holding his dead little sister in a cellar. After a time at the hospital, Tom realizes that he has to kidnap him and take him home. The culmination is a bittersweet ending when William is said to be adopted by Tom. At the same time, the learning of his best friend Zacharias was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom talked to an Interior Ministry official. <br /> <br /> I love 'im' and 'what it's worth, I think he loves me too'. <br /> <br /> It just does not get better that it does?
