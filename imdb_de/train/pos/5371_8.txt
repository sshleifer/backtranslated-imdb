I made my first comment about this movie almost five years ago. The ideas presented in the film still seemed to be largely fictitious, if ever they could be put into action. No more. Well, politics, society and the media in The Running Man actually seem to be very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors that were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) present today: <br /> <br /> Concern over how Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian says, "traditional morality". CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, anxiety and discomfort of participants. CHECK <br /> <br /> cameras everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a central computer system with bar coded passports ("passports" in the film) and sanctioned under the pretext of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> An increasing mix of government and media bordering on incestuous borders. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to handle real-world footage (such as the "digital matting" of Ben Richards's image on the stunt double). INSPECT <br /> <br /> Imprisonment of conscientious objectors or critics of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Economic growth that widens the gap between the wealthy and the non-wealthy; Increasing number of fringe groups responding to the tightening noose of the big government; Riots that arise immediately below or on the surface of any major public event, regardless of their origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Then maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. But to make sure, I move to Switzerland.
