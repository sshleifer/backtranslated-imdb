From the first five episodes of Hammer's 'Hammer House of Horror' series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title 'The House Bleeding to Death' is probably the scariest. As a longtime big fan of Hammer Studios' gothic horror movies, I wonder why it took me so long to see the show recently. So far I have only seen the first five episodes, and I have the strong feeling that the best is yet to come. But even if the series remains as entertaining as the first five episodes, I am satisfied. While the second and third episodes were great to pay attention to their sickly and ingeniously dark humor, this fifth post is definitely the first of the five that delivers the most sincere horror. The episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move into the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, soon after moving in, the family must realize that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which seems to be cursed ... The second episode, directed by Francis Megahy, is much better than its mediocre previous entry "Growing Pains" (Episode 4), and the fairly unknown actors perform well. The film is well done in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "The House Bleeding to Death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer fans want to see in a short horror story. The film offers a spooky atmosphere, real moments of anxiety and smart twists and turns, exciting and entertaining from start to finish. Overall, this Hammer fans is highly recommended.
