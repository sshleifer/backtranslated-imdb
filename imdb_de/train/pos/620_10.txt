The beautiful story of Stardust was written by Neil Gaiman (author of MirrorMask) and really is a good story. I think it would appeal to everyone labyrinth, Princess bride- or 10th Kingdom fan, and yet it is absolutely unique and stands alone. And I think that the film version of this story has a much better end than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil it. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a fairy slave held by a witch in the realm of fairies. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world of the human world. If there is a falling star, Tristan promises to find him a girl with whom he is in love. He does not know that the star in the fairy world has taken the form of a girl and that there are others. Three older witches who want to use their hearts to become young again, and some contentious princes. <br /> <br /> It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I think it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's just magical. It is a true classic fairy tale, as I have not seen it in the cinema since the 1980s.
