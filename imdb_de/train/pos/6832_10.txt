Nice movie in the pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland offers an impressive performance of a diminishing actress dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious spirits, embodied by the death-spirit of a young girl. The acceptance of one's own nature, despite its general difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself is puzzling: it is as if the stage for heroin is a way out. If all American films could only be of such high quality, they knew about adult human relationships and could not try to infantilise and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas of all time. 10/10.
