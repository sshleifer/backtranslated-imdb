I do not expect this movie to be well understood by audiences outside Romania. This certainly tells something about the value or lack of universality of the film, but also about how different the history and even the lives of ordinary people in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> The film is one Adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died shortly after the publication of the book under Communist rule. It tells the story of an intellectual philosophy professor whose life is being destroyed after being imprisoned at the end of the Stalinist era with false accusations. Basically, the first part of the film tells of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to regain his life after his release. His release is actually only obvious, Romania of the 1960s asks him about various kinds of compromise and crime, but his struggle for survival is morally as harsh as in prison. <br /> <br /> The movie is played by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the lead role, would be a megastar in another time and place, we can get a good look into his fabulous acting skills here. Although he suffers from a hesitant narrative and sometimes plunges into unimportant details or character comics, the film is still an important milestone for Romanian cinema as well as for restoring the moral and historical values ​​of Romanian society.
