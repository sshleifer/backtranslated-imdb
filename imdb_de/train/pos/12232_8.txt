As a collector of movie memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this movie, which, having finally seen it, must be the best. There's nothing like hanging on the wall than a 27 x 41 inch image of the melting man. There is nothing worse than an hour and a half image of the Melting Man in your VCR. At first I thought this movie was rubbish, but then I realized that it has some qualities that make me laugh. The figure of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most exciting person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so banal that it is unbelievable! ("It's unbelievable! It seems to get stronger as it melts!) <br /> <br /> And could someone please tell me how the hell they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely and what exactly is this plan to "help" him? If this movie scared the audience, I think he missed his calling.
