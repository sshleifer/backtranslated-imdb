This movie is a great non-stop laugh-uprising that contains all the usual elements of a Dawid-Dhawan comedy - busking heroes, buffoon minions, heroine dolls, evil baddies, wisecracks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a bit of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in duplicate roles of cops and conmen. The heroine of Amitabh, the policeman, is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is Govinda, the policeman. Heroines are, as always, only rouge smothered props. The conmen do not have heroines. Paresh Rawal performs his villainous act in DAUD (He also played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a short role. He is doing a repeat of his famous "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is as always perfect - as a knowledgeable, well-tempered policeman Pyaare Mohan and as Conman Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the Bihari style of Hindi with strange results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, fades compared to him. AB is still fine. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo like herself in the song "Makhna". She dances like wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is great. Take a look at "Kisi Disco My Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not go looking for LOGICs as this is a comedy and the script is very handy. Just enjoy it.
