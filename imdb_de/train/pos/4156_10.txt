I have seen a number of cold case episodes since its premiere (especially now that it follows The Amazing Race immediately, but this was one of the best cases of writing and acting I've seen from Bruckheimer's house.) Especially with The younger officers were in the right place, and the script and editing, soundtrack and acting made this episode a tour d'force. If I were the Producer, I'd suggest this episode for Emmy. The portrait was made by Coop and Jimmy in the 48-minute episode, which means that many talented people do their best. I hope there will be an early warning when this episode is repeated because I'm sure I'll notice one thing that I did not notice the first time.
