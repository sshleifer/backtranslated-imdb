This is one of those movies you experience when you surf the canals on a Saturday afternoon, and you get sucked in and look at the whole thing. I thought it was well played and I really felt for the characters. Although it is a bit slow and focuses more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it never got boring. We do not see too many robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead, most shootings take place when they are ambushed by the police. I thought that Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, did a great job with her character. Switching from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenge to be portrayed, and I enjoyed the subtlety that brought her into the role of television film.
