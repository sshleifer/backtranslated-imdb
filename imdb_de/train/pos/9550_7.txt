Despite the success in comedy or drama, the Turkish directors are denied in the horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of the terrible Turkish horror movies. <br /> <br /> But if you see "Gene," you'll understand it's a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. The special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks suit the movie, but the script is not completely perfect and the theme of the movie is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" makes no difference to horror movies, but does not disappoint thriller fans. In this regard, it's a hit for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
