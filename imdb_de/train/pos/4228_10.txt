A first class columbo from start to finish. I especially like the interaction between Columbo and the killer Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an avid Columbo fan, I can not remember another one in which he ended up not putting the killer up as he does in other episodes. As he tries to determine the correct order of the boxes and the "message" the nephew left behind, it finally dawns on him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good, as in many others.
