This movie is not just about a shooting range, it's never even seen. But that increases the performance of this film. It's about people and how they handle tragedies. I know it was shown to the students who survived the shootout in Columbine, and it was a feeling of closure for many of them. The spectacle is great. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are outstanding in their roles ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after you've seen it. It does not only stimulate discussions about school shootings, but also about human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a jerk, but worth it and I'll see it over and over again
