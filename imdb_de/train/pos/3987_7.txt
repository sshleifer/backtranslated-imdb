The mother is one of those movies that you know are good, maybe even great, but it's as if you eat vegetables or do math homework - a kid - too much work and too much pain in you can invest. <br /> <br /> The story may be unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half-hour, the December-May romance, the notion that a man cheats on his wife and then his lover with her mother , the collection of weak and rather unpleasant characters, who are apparently indifferent to the children. Shot in 2002 or 2003, this film is a return to a collection of British films (usually TV series) from the late 1980s - it has a moral rigor that never fades, creating a stunning throbbing fear The mother is flawless, but that's partly the problem; If a movie that deals with so many sensitive topics has some flaws - inconsistencies of the script, some minor actors - that takes advantage, but if such a movie is so perfect, the movie's experience is raw and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - hurt the viewer; The London in this film is bright and open, filled with rough, cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you're tough like nails or are among those hypersensitive people who like to stomach with tummy pain, sad movies or novels, then you'll enjoy the mother. Anyone in between should miss it or be ready to squirm. And be warned: as hard as the movie is from start to finish, the worst will come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it (for having slept with her boyfriend), and the daughter quietly says she thought about it and she would like to beat. The mother agrees, both get up, and instead of a well-slapped slap the daughter clenches his fist and brings a boxer stroke. Argh !!!
