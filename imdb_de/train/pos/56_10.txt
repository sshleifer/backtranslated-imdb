This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been staged by Larry Clark, then this story about a shootout would probably have been shown through the eyes of the murderer, and whatever caused that person to go crazy instead focuses the plot mainly on the aftermath of a shooting in the school and on the impact of the survivors. <br /> <br /> I had seen Busy Phillips in other films before, but her performance in this film is by far her best. The only other movie I've seen with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan," which is why I almost did not want to see this movie, but she did a very good job herself. <br /> <br /> This is one of The few movies I've seen could actually make me cry. Trust me when I tell you that does not happen often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is to it ...
