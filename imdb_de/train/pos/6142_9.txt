Delightful Disney movie starring Angela Lansbury in fine form as a middle-aged spinner, interested in the wizardry of England in World War II. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and just ideal for her part. She's Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it's in favor of children and for Mother England in a time of great danger. The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of witchcraft while attempting to obtain certain information about sorcery. These three little darlings, sent to Price to escape the London bombings, are wonderful in this enchanting movie for all of us, regardless of age. <br/> <br/> Tessie Oesshea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe There's so little to do in this enchanting movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought of the Ben Stiller movie - "Night at the Museum", at the end of the film, as the relics come alive to fight with the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal town.
