A great movie with great performances by Zack & Lochley. To her displeasure (and mine) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All respect for Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It does not take long for him to begin criticizing Zack (whom I love best in the series) and taking responsibility take over. I'm sure Zack would have done it. The action of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky like Zack. The humor complements it well. 10/10
