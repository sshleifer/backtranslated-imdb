This is a pretty good movie ... yes, some parts are lame and exceptionally practical, and the movie does not really justify the big starcast (AB, SD, Tanuja). The actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with singer KK). In the scene where he meets Amitabh's character for the first time, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, stare, and say no word and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, for the second time in Sarkar, he has again proven to be worthy next to AB. This guy should get more roles, he is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've read the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan played a role too easily. And the little love angle he shared with "What's her face" was completely unnecessary. But he is a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH). Sunjay Dutt is always cool to look at. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely fight for the spot. <br /> <br /> An interesting clock, considering it's Bollywood, although it's a little bit of Hollywood oldies like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the Kwai".
