I saw this movie a night ago on www.afrovideo.org by Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin '), and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit the character designs are a bit too rude and unsurpassable today, but I think it's a satire and a very, very urban retelling of the old stories of Uncle Remus, who created the black American culture right up to the main characters, and the blatant nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." These are not bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I am a white woman who reads and loves these stories. And I also found it an interesting time capsule view of black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Now, to get to the heart of this movie: This movie is a live action / animated film featuring live action with a colleague named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) begins to help her friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from jail, but by a roadblock detained in a shootout with the police land. While waiting for them, Randy involuntarily listens to the fugitive Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he tells Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young newcomer from the big city who is quickly rising from the darkness and ruling Harlem. You know, for me, rabbit, bear and fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animations and live action footage. The film is a graphic and judgmental satire of stereotypes of the 70s. Race, ethnic and different. <br /> <br /> So it's another good Bakshi movie; and should we sweep such films under the carpet? pretend that they never exist? hmmm ... I think that would be a pity; I think we should look at these films and see what happens then, how far we have come since then.
