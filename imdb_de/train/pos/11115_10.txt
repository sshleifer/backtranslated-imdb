I think The Sopranos is a great show because of all the supportive characters. I've bought every video so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes, the best episode is definitely episode 3: denial, anger, acceptance. This episode deals with my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed because he abducted the wrong truck and accidentally killed a truck driver. Brendan was fantastic because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end he was shot while bathing, and this is my favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos. Brendan Filone is the # 1 for me. My # 2 favorite character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed when he tried to assassinate Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney Park after they capture and torture him. My favorite character of the # 3 is Sean Gismonte, who was killed right after Christopher's shot. And last but not least, Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's favorites, is No. 4's favorite character. He was killed on a Tony boat. All the great characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the sopranos. All cool guys are getting killed. Do you know what could change about the sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all dead minor characters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie for their revenge. Brendan Filone will fight back !!!!!!!!! 1
