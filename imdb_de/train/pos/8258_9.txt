At first glance, I tend to equate this with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now that I consider Simon Pegg an undeniable comedy genius, I realize that this is a pretty big claim. To what extent you agree with this last statement may be a good preliminary indication of whether "Fido" will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the comedy attacks where "Shaun" left off, unless we're back in the original, typically American town of the 1950s Living Dead era. The zombie wars are over, and zombies themselves are becoming better adapted, useful members of the community. We are initially informed that this is largely due to the scientific advances of the good people at Zomcom - maybe a nice piece of romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in the dead portrayal of a respectable neighborhood that preserves its core values ​​while providing space for zombies and the special dangers they pose. The charm and balance with which it does so is almost perfect enough. Issues one might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy - the veneer for good, clean living, maintaining looks, suppressed emotions, confused parental values, social well-being, and the plight of the estranged individual. <br /> <br /> It is a story told with a happy heart and broad appeal, brought to life through the all-around cast of the film. It is one of those works that really shows that everyone involved has taken part. It's also fun to imagine Billy Connelly having to learn his script ... <br /> <br /> So it's likely that you will appreciate the humor of this film unless your dad has tried To eat them.
