"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps an absolute favorite of all time. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, known for splatter anime and slippery hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he had done more campiness like that. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence, the parts in which Lord Helumis blows up his failed henchmen, the party riots caused by Bill (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Worsle , appears. <br /> <br /> Look at this. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: This is not for serious, demanding anime fans!
