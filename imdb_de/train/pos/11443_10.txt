This movie is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. The profound vision of an artist, his art, which springs intuitively from its natural source, brings us an inspiring Hosanna who mixes his creations with trees, with white water that crashes against rocks, fields and rain that we all derive from the clay of this magnificent Earth are made. It does not spare us the occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle of combining art with nature. The recognition also goes to the filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer, who staged the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing, photographed and edited do not miss this fantastic movie!
