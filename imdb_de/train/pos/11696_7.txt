"A Thief in the Night" is a movie that was generally ignored by film fans because of its low budget (which was obvious) and its theme - the rapture of the true Christian church and the fate of the bereaved. Even so, it was a gripping story that mesmerized the viewer and definitely made them review their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - it even showed a pastor preaching the word, but he did not believe it because he knew exactly why he was left behind. This movie and its sequel "Distant Thunder" are films you must have seen. Despite the new "Left Behind" series, which tells the same story with a much higher budget, the influence is still the same - "A Thief in the Night" has broken the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
