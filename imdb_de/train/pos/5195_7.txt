As a lover of bad movies I definitely came across paydirt with this movie. The plot is not that bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask, "What the hell is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make the funniest movie ever. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore had become so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects are to speed up the fight scenes to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is a slow-motion slow motion that jumps onto a three-meter-high wall (dropping it backwards), naked men coming out of big letters, and sex literally dashing down the roof cable holds the roof, which burns). <br /> <br /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a completely random and random comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun of all the people who talk to people talking a little weirdly. There are so many bad things about this movie, but they are fun in a fun way, and if you look at the movie, you might miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for the actual value, 10/10 for the cheese factor, 10/10 for the selection of mistakes and patches, on average 7/10.
