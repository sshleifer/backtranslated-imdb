Skip McCoy is a threefold loser who is unable to push back his instincts on the road. He takes the purse Candy in a subway. What he does not know is that Candy wears a secret microfilm, a microfilm that's of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has created an extraordinary drama in the seedy underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government officials merge, making Pickup On South Street a mesmerizing sight from the first to the last minute. Based on a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller thrilled this adaptation with a rigorous political agenda. This was felt by many at the time to be settled, but focusing only on their anti-communist inclinations is a big drawback. <br /> If you dig a little deeper and you find the characters as intriguing as any that Fuller directs the protagonist is the hero of the play, a rogue and a shallow person from whom his exploits are not born. Love for his country, they are born out of his stubborn trail. It is quite a success that Fuller developed one of the best antiheroes of the '50s, and I'm sure he was very grateful to Richard Widmark as McCoy, all grinning and freezing, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent and is the heart of the movie. However, it is the Oscar who has nominated Thelma Ritter to take on the acting award, her Moe is strong and unsightly like the surrounding characters, but there is a weary warmth that knights convey majestically. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie in Texture, but an A-based movie, Pickup On South Street is a really classic and entertaining movie that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9.10
