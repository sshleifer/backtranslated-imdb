If you usually watch a short film, you are always worried that the person who made the film is pulling in too much. This is not the case with this one. A great story about a young girl who has had enough and other worldly forces trying to put things right. Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of portraying the spirit of twisted justice, helping to convey the complexity of the world. Fuzzy line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the young girl and the father are doing great things in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely the show stealer in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie because of its complexity, performance and its entire history.
