(Spoiler?) <br /> <br /> while the historical accuracy might be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR ... such things are now easier to apologize), I liked the art's approach. Although not really a kind of house movie. It offers a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is too short. and 2. The voice you hear from time to time whispering is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 5/10
