Guinea pig: the devil's experiment is without a doubt ****************************************************************************** ************************************************** * This film puts it in a nutshell, perhaps you think of what point? It's about satisfying the fans of extreme violence and bleeding. This movie has a bit of gore and tortures women more or less violently. There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered bloody. I'll tell you one, though Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought that Hostile was a crazy brutal torture movie, then you did not see half of it until you saw Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (uncut) ***** (7)
