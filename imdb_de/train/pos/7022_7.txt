FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I waited almost a year for this movie to come out and finally saw it at the premiere in SB. I met some of the actors who were really nice and great in the movie. I watched the trailer so much that I did not know what to expect, but I was thrilled. The movie was really nice to watch and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Ryan Donowho, and Dominique Swain was also good at it. The other actors were good too. I hope it comes out on DVD soon !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first looked at Ryan from the OK and then saw him in a number of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He's great in this movie and all he does is indie. I also like Dominique, but I have not seen her that often. I hope to see you both soon !!!
