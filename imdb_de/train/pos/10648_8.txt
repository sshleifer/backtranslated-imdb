What can I say, what has not yet been said about "The Haunting"? It has everything that would make a great picture. Wonderful sets, atmospheric music and a sound design to die for. However, the script sometimes confuses the mind in such a funny, surrealistic way. The entire team must have forgotten to read through it, perhaps because they were too busy creating CG effects and building gothic sets to see how weak the conspiracy was. Each member of the cast offers a worthy achievement, albeit with little persuasiveness for the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most work to do, while the others mostly respond to her. But that was it. I can only say that it was two beautiful hours, but you will definitely want more. A lot more.
