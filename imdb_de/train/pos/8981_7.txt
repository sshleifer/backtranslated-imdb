Dig! I would tell anyone, even if you do not like, that Metallica sees "some monster". It's a spinal tap documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world behaving like a mental child during a kind of breakdown. It's fun and fascinating. In the same direction ditch comes! A film about "The Dandy Warhol's" and "Brian Jonestown Massacre", two Portland bands that start a kind of music scene in their hometown just to make one of the bands huge and a book that gets into music history. Right from the beginning, the two bands are moving in opposite directions just because they can make decisions, good or bad. Filmed for over seven years and sometimes painfully seen, we see the rise of the dandy to fame (thanks to this vodaphone ad!) And the Jonestown spectacle of scene-instigators to wavering wannabe. As the bands dissolve more and more, the friendships become tense and break at various points in quarrels and even in stage fights. All of this is half funny and half tragic, believing that it is perverse or not. As I said, you can also watch the Metallica movie if you are not interested in the band. Dig! On the other hand, it is a bit different and more fun and much easier to see if you are interested in both bands. Still a good movie and more evidence of not being in a band than encouraging it as a career path. Dig! Is a crazy ride on Rock'n'Roll's fur tails and a nice example of the pitfalls and joys of being famous or wanting.
