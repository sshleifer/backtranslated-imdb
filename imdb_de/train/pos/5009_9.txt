As the first of the TV specials released on the elaborate boxing set "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials" last November, this CD will be released separately for those who do not want to bridge the dollar for all five specials. As an investment, this is indeed the best, just because Streisand is the purest and the most impressive. That she succeeds so well is a key part of her legend. Streisand had signed a long-term contract with CBS to produce hours-long variety shows, a format almost extinct nowadays. Streisand consisted of 22 of this CBS special broadcast, which was first aired in April 1965. A handful of bestselling albums, some dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows, and her successful Broadway run in Funny Girl. <br /> <br /> Filmed in bright black and white, the program is divided into three parts. With the creative transition of "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland", the first segment shows her growing up from childhood through figures as different as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Featuring a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul, the second installment opened in Manhattan's chic mountain village of Goodman's, where it's elegantly disguised in a series of glamorous costumes while singing depression time songs like "I'm Got Plenty of Nuthin '" The best things in life are free "with funny irony. Back to basics, the third segment is a straight-ahead concert starting with a flickering version of "When the Sun Comes Out," featuring a "Funny Girl" level and its classic, melancholic version of Happy Days Are Here is "Ending Again" about the credits, as well as the short introduction she recorded in 1986 when the special was first released on VHS, and for those who know Streisand only for their expensive concert tickets and political fundraising a true look at the question of why she is so worshiped now.
