"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on many levels. Of course, the supposedly staged "theater prologue" could not have originated in any theater in the world. Think of the huge pools and three-story fountains for By A Waterfall. (Berkeley directed John Garfield six years later in "They Made Me A Criminal" and let the Dead End kids sing "By a Waterfall" as they take a shower). <br/> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best Production number in the picture. It's a catalog of the Warner Bros. sensibilities of the 30s. Note the African boys who were interspersed with white and Asian prostitutes in the scene. In other films of that time, you would never integrate blacks into a social scene unless they were carriers of a train or maid in a large house. Here the blacks sit at the bar and sing with the others. I also get a thrill when the dancers of the military make a presentation of Roosevelt. There is also the NRA Eagle - the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration's New Deal. FDR was the new president and hopes were so great that he would pull the nation out of depression. Of course you would never see such a thing from the working class that comes from MGM. Warner Bros. fully supported F.D.R. Administration. <br /> <br /> Little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better when she plays the Chinese hooker "Lil". She barely watches her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature mistakes. <br /> <br /> The pre-code stuff is fun. The "By a Waterfall" number is wonderful in this regard. The girls undress in their swimsuit in the crowded bus, driving through Times Square with all the lights. The outspread eagle girls swimming above the camera offer the kind of step footage that was not seen for 35 years. In a few months, the law of production would eliminate such naughty pleasures.
