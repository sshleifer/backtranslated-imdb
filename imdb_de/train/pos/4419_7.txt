I saw this movie and heard how director Juan Gerard spoke at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. All I knew was that it was the story of an eight-year anniversary. old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is reminiscent of "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: the roulette wheel (Casablanca), "chicken clucking", references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; You will find more. The homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) is an indication of Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a sort of Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is is the conclusion of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and his film medium, which he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real, as well as the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover), but his dream was to shoot this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and play him. Keitel holds the screen powerful as a mysterious and mysterious grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. but stay with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is honest as he is, and his passion and his heart really come through this sincere first effort. I would definitely see it again and hope he continues his film career. <br /> <br />
