In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie had told her that she should not do such dudel films like these or anything like that. At the time, Douglas Sirk was called "weeping for women" at least in Europe after he stopped governing. And when he was writing "written in the wind", Sirk had only three films to shoot: "clouded angels", "time to love and time to die", his masterpiece, IMHO. and finally "Imitation of Life" (1960). Then there was silence. Actually, the characters of Bacall and Hudson are not interested in Sirk. You are too straightforward, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone, who was a sort of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander, and her brother Robert Stack provide the plot's main interest. The film is a steady flash. The fickleness of the brother and sister of a family of wealthy Texas oil owners is highlighted by shrill clothing and slippery cars driving in a derrick at full speed scenery. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is astounding: Suit and Chignon play with a little Derrick: she's ready for life, the rebel is tamed. Now alone because she lost Hudson (but still he was not in love with her). This ending is a bit reactionary, but the melodrama is par excellence, and three years later, in "Imitation of Life," Sarah-Jane (Susan) Kohner) is blamed because she does not know her place.
