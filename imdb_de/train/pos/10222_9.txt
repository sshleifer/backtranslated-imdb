The unusual duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte teamed up to present some interesting performances and themes in The Angel Levine. Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and they belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his craft, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He only has to apply for social assistance. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he calls to God for help. <br /> <br /> Well, if he had got someone like Henry Travers, things might have worked out differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he had been away from this mortal coil for over 100 years and all his attachments to earthly things had disappeared. God sent Mostel something else, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should at least receive basic training in angels before receiving an assignment. I still have many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he was hit by a car at the beginning of the movie. You have put his problems and problems to the worst, and you have a good conflict that is related to the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew named Levine actress Ida Kaminsky, who a few years ago was nominated for Best Actress in The Shop Main Street received. The other prominent role is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea, who plays a nice Jewish doctor. I remembered O'Shea's brogue from The Verdict and was really surprised when he saw and heard how he dismissed the role of the doctor. <br /> <br /> The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It was brought to you by an outstanding cast and created, of course, by the renowned writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you see it in the transmission.
