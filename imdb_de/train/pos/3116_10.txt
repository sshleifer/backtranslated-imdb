The last part of the action-thriller series is probably just the hardest hit of the three films. It continues to play the anti-bond theme. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know something about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits the nail on the head - from cinematography to choreography / stunt work to screenplay and acting. <br /> <br /> The film starts very fast as Bourne runs in front of the Moscow police. The story seems to go right where the first movie left off. Time is a bit confused here, but we know that Bourne remembers things. A sudden flashback when trying to clean himself almost catches him, but he manages it and does not kill anyone. You are not his destination. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as is Nicky Parsons, who also seems to have a past with Bourne. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is in your face after almost everything. The chase is even more intense when it seems possible than the first two. And the veteran who chases Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in terms of renditions and other government policies, but that is minor and very well integrated into the plot. All in all, this is the best result of this year's trilogy, though not the best action trilogy of all time.
