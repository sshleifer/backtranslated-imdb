I keep it succinct, the people who wrote the storylines for this show are awesome, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on screen, what makes her happy. It's a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I saw the new episodes for the first time, which was probably about 6/7 months ago, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was disappointed to find he died when I rummaged on Google. He was so funny and played his character perfectly, an overprotective dad who likes to keep his daughters in the spotlight and not boys. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I believe, has lost its power, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Also, I think most people would enjoy seeing them.
