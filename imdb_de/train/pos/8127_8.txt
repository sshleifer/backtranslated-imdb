While this may be a bit of preaching about the issue of progress as the saving grace of humanity, it's still a stunning movie that predicts the science-fiction special-effect blockbusters that would need another 40 years on the screen. It predicts the global chaos of World War II, but extends the premise by having the conflict in the last 30 years, and then tells the epic story of human struggle from the rubble into the wilderness of space. The acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this may be a result of the contrast to the visual representations that must have been absolutely breathtaking at the time of the release of the film and still impress today. This is a movie that anyone who is interested in the SF genre should not miss.
