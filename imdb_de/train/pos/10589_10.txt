I enjoyed Longstreet, which slipped into the successful series Ironside TV by Raymond Burr and should compete with the competition. However, this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - I think wrongly - that Longstreet was unable to compete with Mr. Burr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope a box with Longstreet appears. <br /> <br /> The authors should note that this story idea has been briefly researched here and that much more could and should be done to show the game and interplay of disabilities on television.
