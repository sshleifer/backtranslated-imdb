Time paroxysms are the devil's noose for underemployed heads. It's fun to think about what happens when? Filmmakers and writers have repeatedly covered this in a number of films and on television, including "Star Trek: First Contact," the "Back to the Future" trilogy, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," Groundhog Day "and the Stargate SG1 Tribute, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's "All You Zombies" was written decades ago and yet people will be reading this short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's brilliant film "12 Monkeys," it's hard to see what continuity issues can be, as opposed to action elements that should cause us to rethink our conception of the film. Repeated visits will lead us to different conclusions if we remain open. <br /> <br /> Some people seeing the movie for the first time will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man troubled by what Adam describes as "the constant ripping of experience" he visits from time travel. Future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but a call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he was sent back in 1996 on his personal schedule. <Br /> <br /> Even if this could be interpreted as an event that had to happen in a universe with a certain timeline to make sure that the timeline does not change ... Cole must die in front of his younger man Even for destiny to be realized. If this is the case, time is like a liquid, it always finds its own level or its own path, regardless of the external forces that act on it. It stumbles the mind to think too much about these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that will then determine the actions of those who have the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the movie, that is then that the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or? The movie has probably led to a lot of drunken brawls in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> Bonus material on the DVD makes for a very interesting viewing. Gilliam was more than normal under pressure to put the film under budget, which comes as no surprise after the "Münchhausen" debacle and in view of his later attempt to film "Don Quixote". I would call the "Making of" documentary one of the most interesting I have ever seen. It is certainly not a whitewash and observes precisely the difficulties and occasional conflicts that arise between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his "7½th" release because the film was written by other authors - and therefore not "his" movie - does not do the movie justice. <br /> <Brad Pitts's portrayal of Goines is Curious, though his character is not particularly likeable, look at one of the scenes from the asylum on his light-walled gaze, which is disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song "What a Wonderful World "was used at the end of the two" 12 Monkeys "and the final installment of the television series" The Hitchhiker's "Guide to the Galaxy." Both the film and the TV series featured British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a sci-fi story that is entertained in the same way as the mental stimulation of a chess game, it's not mindless recovery, that's for sure.
