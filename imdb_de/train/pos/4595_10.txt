Jackie Chan's name is synonymous with stunts. This movie has never failed you. The first best chase scene and the last off-the-peg roll-down scene is as risky as a miracle in knowing the meaning of fear. This film comes close to Jackie's best, which is PROJECT A. The main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars, with Jackie carrying the film completely on his shoulders, as in this film. This may be the main reason why this movie made Jackie one of the greatest martial arts stars, followed by Bruce Lee. The movie has nice comic notes too. What distinguishes this film is the ability of Jakie to show his venerable side, which he discusses with the martial arts battle hero. This film was followed by a sequel that was good, but quite tame compared to its predecessor.
