Of course, this critically acclaimed film has not yet been released on DVD in the US, as is another big movie - Christine Lahti's "Housekeeping" from the same year. However, if you can support regional (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are also some VHS copies on the internet. Davis is complemented by a great story as well as notable performances by her side cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, great Jan Adele. Amazingly or not, this movie and its stars were not recognized for the Oscar award, just like housekeeping, but treat yourself to both - you'll be glad you did!
