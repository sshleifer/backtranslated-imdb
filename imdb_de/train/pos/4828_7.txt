Rupert Friend's Prince Albert is a performance that raises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is amazing. As we know, after Prince Albert died, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression and looked in the eyes of Ruper Friend, whom I understood. The movie does not lead us to death, but to an incident that could possibly have cost his life. An act of love. I believed it, or I should tell him. I believed what he thought was genuine. Nothing or anyone comes close to the subtlety and profundity of Freund's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not think she was Victoria. No real feeling for the period. It might not be her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
