Airwolf The Movie, A variation of the original 2-part pilot. Although the film is shorter, it does contain extra material that was not seen in the 2-hour pilot. The pilot is much more pilot than the movie. 2 Parter combined) But the movie is actually another cut with extras and cuts off there. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look, even if you've set the first season DVD, I'd still buy a copy of it. The "movie" It's still in some stores like Virgin, Woolworths and similar outlets like Mixed Media Stores, Although Usually Must Be Ordered Looking around the Airwolf shops, Airwolf was truly one of the least valued 80's shows. <br /> <br /> Currently a full size Airwolf is being converted for a helicopter museum:) Info and work in progress images are over at http://Airwolf.org. Even with Airwolf mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It seems she is finally going to stay again :)
