Okay, at first I hate to comment on this, but I felt I had to get up for this movie. So many people played around with it and I felt that people who might want to see it would get a second opinion. First of all, Bend It Like Beckham is not supposed to be the film's most profound movie of the century. If you are looking for it, go elsewhere. Just because it's an independent film, it does not have to be artistic. It should give you a good feeling, and you should enjoy seeing it, and these two things are accomplished with ease. Second, acting is not good, even though "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is not good. The movie does not have to act that way, so do not look for it. It's a family movie. If you wanted that, you would not honestly investigate this movie or not. <br /> <br /> Finally he has a really nice story. I think it's well thought out and entertaining. It is also largely life-long for this culture. So, if you want to sit down and watch a movie, you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you're looking for something with thoughtful plot lines and big dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
