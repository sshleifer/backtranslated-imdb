This movie captured my heart from the beginning when I heard Quincy Jones' first notes or saw the wonderful purple color of the flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole cast delivers the best performance in a movie I've seen in years, and Spielberg has outdone himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh Lord!), Danny Glover and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the insecurity and sense of inferiority needed for the character, and we grow with her, we become strong with her throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as a Shug Avery, even when she is at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" actually have "souls." The ever-likeable, charming Danny Glover makes it wonderful to make him hate him, and the great music of (I'd say, sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this great movie! The photography, the music, the director and the music make this beautiful, soulful film an experience of life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
