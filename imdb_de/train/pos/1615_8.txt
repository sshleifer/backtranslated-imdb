Wonderful romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who wants to marry a man she's comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls into his wayward, furious brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp with many great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I was told) are perfect for letters and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on screen. A must, especially for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both are awesome and have earned the Oscars they got. A nice, funny movie. Something you must have seen!
