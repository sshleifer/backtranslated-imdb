I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after the tour. I suspect that the first commentator never lost a parent or someone who is very close to him in death. I had many such losses, and this movie talked to me. One of the main topics is how we do not deal with questions / problems / stories with our loved ones until it is too late. You are incapacitated or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen to their stories and record them, tell them you love them, and solve differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I love the director's portrayal of the two daughters' relationship - as one of six siblings, I realize he understands how complex these relationships are. His story as a cameraman is also loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! The casting is outstanding - a movie you should not miss!
