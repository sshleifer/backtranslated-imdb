My family and I have seen this movie many times over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and heartwarming. When we show compassion between two families of two countries, thousands of miles apart, and the most sinister coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God has to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 years old Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desi, the heart that was heartfelt, has a great job playing her part, and for me it was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> All in all a 10 out of 10 points. There are no disadvantages to this sweet human story. Children of all ages are tearful, then they see it with joy and it brings the audience family together with a smile and good feelings.
