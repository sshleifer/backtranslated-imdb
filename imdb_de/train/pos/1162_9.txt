Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV and think he's awesome. But I did not know that he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" velous like the despised woman. Good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving Amanda's revenge on an abusive doctor. I will leave it at that. Kudos
