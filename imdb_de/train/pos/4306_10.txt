The mere fact that I think about the film a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film. For me, this is the Grand Canyon as a movie that touches you in one way or another. I really believe that there was the Grand Canyon before the movie Crash. The main difference between the two films in my opinion is the time of their release. I will not argue which one is the better, but I will argue that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this topic. I'll start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to post other topics about movies that we may share because I have a true love for the movie.
