I waited forever until I saw that, because all the reviews I read said it was terrible! I rented it with the worst and although it is hardly the best Sandler movie, there is much worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the movie is not serious, but that's all part of the fun! A great way to spend an afternoon, and you might even laugh once! A good movie, it's worth renting!
