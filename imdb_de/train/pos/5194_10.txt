This is one of my favorite sports movies from Hong Kong. It's one of John Woo's first films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. His influences from working under Chang Cheh can be seen in this film. The action is good, the fight choreography is led by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. It features Wei Pei from "Five Venoms" and a series of faces that fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions know. The story is interesting, there are a few decent phrases and the structure of the characters and their relationships with each other is done skillfully. This movie had only one VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a Region 3 DVD, which is available on DVD in the US. The movie can be viewed either in the original language or in English synchronized version. I highly recommend this movie.
