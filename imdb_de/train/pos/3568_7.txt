This film advances Cinderella's story into the early 1950s, making the Isle of Man a background, albeit eccentric. The ugly sisters have become wild glamorous English girls of the upper classes, and together with Kathleen Turner as stepmother, they float around in various wonderful costumes. The story is a bit different from the traditional version: it is strangely combined with the plot of "King Lear" at the beginning, and in later stages Cinderella is more assertive than usual. It looks great and works pretty well on the whole, but sometimes tops it.
