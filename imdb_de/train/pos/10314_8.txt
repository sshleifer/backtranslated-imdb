These and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, something is missing in this new series. Perhaps they stress too much the lesson that must be learned. It's a bit shabbier and more sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that the lovers can never unite, no matter what they do. I remember that the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later in "The Lake House") did not surprise me because I first saw this episode.
