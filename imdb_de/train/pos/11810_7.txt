I liked it anyway. Warren Beatty is fair only as a comic hero. What saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and a mediocre script. I had really expected something more substantial in terms of action or action, but I got very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to see some of Hollywood's then biggest stars in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and did not even hear this movie was Madonna. She did not belong to this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. The film was simply silent in some places. They expected something more and got nothing. Al Pacino is a really bad guy and he is pretty good. He and Beatty are doing a great good and bad. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a movie other than Isthar. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is that it's good, but it could have been so much better. I liked it as a kid because I thought it was cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are amazing, the writing is just fair and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought that the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a great movie, I thought it could have ended up with a bit more bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only the 7 comic colors, which makes it optically anyway excellent. <br /> <br /> The costumes and make-up were also spotless. The make-up for the bad guys was great. Beatty simply does not have such a larger-than-life character. Nevertheless, this is a good movie that could have been much more. It's better for me than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out almost at the same time. Of course, this movie was much bigger.
