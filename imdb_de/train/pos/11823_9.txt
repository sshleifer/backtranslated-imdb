I really enjoyed this true form of Dick Tracy personality. This is a well made product that uses advanced technology to develop a comic era filled with images. If you're a fan of the old Dick Tracy B & W movies or have recently watched them, you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. The pastel colors and larger-than-life characters rendered in a meticulous, authentic interpretation of a bygone era are entertainment as it should be. Personally, I find that Madonna's musical element is an important part of this film. The CD with their music from this movie is one that I have heard many times over the years. She is just so well made and musically tuned to this time. In my opinion, Madonna's most beautiful moment is on the screen as well as especially musical. This will certainly bring out the "child" in you.
