I remember seeing it as a kid in the UK, fascinated by the story and narrative of Laurence Olivier. We would not talk about anything else the next day at school. I can imagine that the ratings for the first performance were huge. This is simply the best and most complete series of documentation, though they had to reduce the story to the bones they could capture so much. Interestingly, the battles of Britain and North Africa were central and not recognized by the Americans as such. The series shows the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, and the ill-treatment of Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. The images of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, forever guilty of treating the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not number one in the IMDb ranking. Maybe they show their preference for documentary films. Spoilers - we win.
