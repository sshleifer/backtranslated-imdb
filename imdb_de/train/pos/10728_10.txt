The perfect room fantasy film. A group of children accidentally get into space and have to go down, but they do. This would not be a family movie if they all died. Then everything will be sad. They do not want Kate Capsaw, the lead actress, to give a Golden Globe performance, but unfortunately neither they nor Lea Thompson have won one. That's so shitty. I can not say enough, this movie is so great, Lea Thompson, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is for sure the best. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated and the space warehouse was so undervalued. It should be the other way around <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10 or maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
