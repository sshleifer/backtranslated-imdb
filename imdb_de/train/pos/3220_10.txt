The soldier may not have an Academy or Lucas special effects, but it definitely does it for me. I will not tell you what it's about, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a great, fucking, forward-looking action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell does not say much, he usually has an eerie or drunken look, but it suits the character. There are great action and fight scenes; Some of the scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood suggests that we have to escape our normal lives. I did not see Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I am fortunate enough to have a wife digging in guy films. We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes hard guys / sci-fi movies.
