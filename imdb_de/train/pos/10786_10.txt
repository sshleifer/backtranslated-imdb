Me and my sister rented it every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad (but they left us anyway) and I love it ... I can not find anyone who lives near me and knows what I am I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find that somewhere on DVD !! I would like to see it right now, when I loved it so much as a kid ... and I'm 15 years old now !!! I remember so much ... that was the place where I got the little rabbit fufu song and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl got there by sliding the slide on her little playground
