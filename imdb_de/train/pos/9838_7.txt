Born Again is an okay episode of season 1. The reincarnation bit is cool in my opinion. The more I look at it, the more I like it, but it will never go beyond "very good". Although not very memorable, I will always remember the reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I'll say what's good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yeah! <br /> <br /> The aquarium was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown out of a window. Very noble. x] <br /> <br /> The Bad: Marry the wife of your best friend !? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to be reborn. <br /> <br /> Why did the guy who died by tangling his scarf try to take off his scarf instead? > <br /> Conclusion: Okay, not very memorable. 10.7
