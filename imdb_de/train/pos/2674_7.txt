If the redundancy of the exit, the boat, the bus, the bus ... is a way to lose time, you should return to the Hollywood movies that summarize this part in a montage to get there the shots. and when you do this, you remain disconnected and in the cinematic suspense that results from not really showing the realities of life. The lengthy travels actually give the viewer the same frustration and "wait-in-line" feeling the characters have to endure. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Indeed. The suspense of this journey is the key to the "rootlessness" of this Turkish family. Nice movie with great acting. Sorry, but it's worth it.
