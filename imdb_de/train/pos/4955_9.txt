I do not know why people in movies always have a deeper meaning or consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> What if you just entertain? Something that Morgan Freeman stands out for. He has the chance to show a bit. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name that makes people watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A little humor, a bit of pathos, bittersweet, but nothing over the top. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as a receptionist in a construction company. As he looks adoringly at Freeman and says, "You want me to be a woman." He is just funny. The fight scene between wife Vega, her ex-husband and girlfriend is also wonderful. In short, it's a sweet, charming movie that makes you smile. They could do much, much worse.
