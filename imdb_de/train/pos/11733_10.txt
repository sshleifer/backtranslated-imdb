Elvira Mistress of the Dark is just that, a camping mix of fun, sexiness, horror, and comedy cast in a low-cut black robe crowned with a sky-high, black, hairy hairstyle. This movie will delight any Elvira fan. She brings Elvira closer and more personal and goes deep into her ... er past, revealing her enormous background. <br /> <br /> The film takes you on a ride with Elvira while she's coming from TV Horror Hostess with the Mostess to her hometown Fallwell Mass to claim her legacy from a deceased great aunt. There, where she meets a stuffy city, a boring movie owner, a scary big-uncle who looks more than good. A lot of high school kids who love them instantly, and a city government that does everything it can to get them out of town, even if it means burning them at the stake! Watch Elvira courting the children, taking care of the stud, dodging her creepy great-uncle and the clogged "preservatives" that have no kind words for her in Elvira Mistress of the Dark! Elvira would say, "I guarantee it's a shout! (Yells in the background) Whoa, good that I did not say it was a gas!"
