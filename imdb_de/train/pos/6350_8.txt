I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers seemed to be running for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of movies over and over, but I can not wait for this to be for everyone! Not a big fan of Jim, but that suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and the 'feel-good factor' is out of scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a great job turning the movie into a movie.
