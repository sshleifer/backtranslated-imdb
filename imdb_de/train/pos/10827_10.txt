Still Crazy was compared to the Spinal Tap, as both are comedies about dishwashing R & R groups. Actually, the similarity ends here because Still Crazy is written and played much better, while the Spinal Tap script turns from the slightly amusing first 10 minutes into a bustle that makes Beavis and Butthead seem demanding in comparison. Still crazy is a formula, but the sympathy of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers have eliminated the film's a priori predictability. People who expect a spinal tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the carefree nature of the film, but I would take a successful, self-deprecating bustle from Still Crazy over a pompous, but failed shot at the satire, the spinal cord.
