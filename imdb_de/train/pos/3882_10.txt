I looked at the tape, rewound it immediately, looked at it again and laughed twice as hard. I strongly recommend this band for those who do not hate but feel uncomfortable with transvestites. It shows you that transvestism is a feature and not the totality of being. The comedy is not a single topic. This man is brilliant. All comics should focus on openness, intelligence, and talent.
