Although the target audience was far behind the target audience, I always had a weakness for YA fiction. So of course I was fascinated by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery of a long-dead actress is portrayed in simple, simplistic terms, putting the danger for the young man in jeopardy. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young viewers will not be upset. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciated about the story was that the final results were more serious and significant and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we will see her again in another puzzle.
