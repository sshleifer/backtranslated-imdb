A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. In itself, that would be a pretty bad angle in a story. So there is more. There is also the fact that the chess player in the world is completely alienated because of its brilliance in the game and there is a story that tracks the player. <br /> <br /> A romantic frivolity, this film takes the suspense of historical events that have shaped the chess player and work quite well. It's easy to get used to the two main characters, and it's easy to believe they'll get together like in this movie. The added effect of the tournament is also very good and creates a nice tension setting. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of the chess players because I do not play the game myself, but it looks good believable. All in all, the movie is easily lost. It is also very easily forgotten. So it's nice to see, but no more than that. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 chess players trapped between a tower and a hard place
