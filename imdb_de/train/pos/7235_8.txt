"A Girl's Folly" is a kind of semi-comedic, mediocre look at the movie business of the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse of life in an early film studio, where we experience the assembly of a set, walk through a scene, deal with film fanatics, even a lunch at the commissioner. We are also familiar with little-known cinematic facts - did you know, for example, that "movie actors often do not know the plot of the picture in which they work?" The plot of This movie is essentially the movie star Kenneth Driscoll's discovery and romance of a young young star he spotted shooting in the country. I think the 30-minute version I watched was cut, on the same volume as Cecil B. De Mille's The Cheat. It's a very believable movie - a simple watch with lots of extras. As a bonus, it contains some of the best illustrated captions I've ever seen with a silent movie.
