Listen, I do not care what anyone says, because Cypher is nothing short of a 5 star movie. Cypher is not a B-movie, I'm not repeating it. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice to say that I am a connoisseur of the best spy films in the world and this movie is nothing short of top flight. I can not emphasize how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy films ever conceived and made. The technology in this film is above the horizon of spacetime. In fact, I have to admit that Cypher has completely surprised the hell out of me. In fact, I've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics, some of whom have downplayed the movie, have no idea what the hell they're talking about. Do not listen to the haters. And actually, the ratings from Cypher were mostly positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is a kind of film that is so advanced and so great that it is outdone by most critics and cynics. There is nothing wrong or cheap about Cypher. Again, the cinematography, scenery, technology, plot and drama are 100% first-rate. Of course, I will not reveal anything. This is not a spoiler. And although some critics say Cypher should have been in the cinema, I think quite the contrary. Cypher is a movie that was apparently only suitable for the release of DVDs and not in a bad way. Cypher must be the biggest subterranean spy film ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... watch out! Cypher equally deserves the award in the AONN Multimedia Research, 5 star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is a counter-espionage at its best. No doubt and get away. Nothing is as it seems, and truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
