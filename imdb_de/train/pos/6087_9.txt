I saw this movie in the first few weeks it came out (I can not remember exactly when). This movie is not for a person without good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about it. Or as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this site, I saw that people did not have a good word and it did not get a very good rating and it should have gotten better. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I only give you the opinion of another person.
