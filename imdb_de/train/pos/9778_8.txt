This is a trio of narratives "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali" about an experimental commune (or so) called Taylor-Eriksson group that brought people traveling in themselves and to the realm of the world unknown and got here and because of a bit of damage, I would say. Many years later, some of this damage lurks and waits for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart and the suspect was a man who may not have existed. Apparently, this woman is able to project an inner demon, or finds the sister of the man who was killed when she tries to talk to that woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who "wants to jump out of his skin". He's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to a psychiatrist who happens to be a former member of the community, which leads the good doctor to help the young man realize his wish. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer trying to "heal" this woman who belonged to this community and let go of a kind of demon who has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did or if SHE did so she could not survive in her anymore. All three stories are pretty scary and exciting because you're never really sure what to expect. The premise and settings are so different from those of conventional horror movies that they are added to strangeness. This has a kind of low-budget look and feel, but also creates a rather scary atmosphere, much to his credit. I looked at it open-mouthed, and when the true fears (and blood) came, it was pretty hard. I found the movie very interesting and disturbing and I really liked it. A good little find, this one would give me 8 out of 10 points.
