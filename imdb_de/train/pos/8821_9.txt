The question is, can such an entertaining movie really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I picked it up in a used video store for 99 cents, simply because of the title and the fact that the box was labeled "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron has been considered a quality feature since my first fame). Suburbia "and" Class of 1984 "). We did not expect a movie that was as successful as this one. Their basic conspiracy is as follows: Grange, this goombaeske thug from Planet Earth, deprives "the Bank of the Moon" and becomes a penal colony on a remote planet (I can not even remember the name of the planet) because of the bauxite to me brought and other minerals. The "governor" of the colony and the owner of the mine use the prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the planet), reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle from all over the planet and they have to deal with it. Then there is the nameless "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting nightmare. Much of the film revolves around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood hit to the sides) with explosions galore. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, California, or one of those dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. What really shines the movie is a surprisingly fantastic soundtrack with several LA punk bands of the 80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pushed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. I can not even remember the names of the bands (they're in the credits) except Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I'd heard of before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely watching that <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of time and can best be enjoyed with a 12-pack of beer and some of your closest friends.
