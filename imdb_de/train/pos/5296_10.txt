Absolutely funny. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreer) is a twisted little guy with lots to see and laugh about. It's like being loose in a kitsch museum! I have not laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom. I loved to see old friends from the Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, in front of Waters' camera. The cast is just wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Use the best elements of past Waters atrocities (especially undervalued polyester) and many new surprises. Made me sick in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
