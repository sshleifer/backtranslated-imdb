** Attention spoiler ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would say that Rob Roy is one of the best movies of the 90s. It was an amazing performance for everyone involved, especially for the acting of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and shame that men can represent in themselves. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> it is constantly and unfairly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably similar only to the fact that they are both Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison often bothers me, because it is believed that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a bit offensive to me. Simply put, I love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow, how much I love "Rob Roy". Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, the William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. Because of this account, he is also a perfect person who never wronged and basically shows his Scottish compatriots to the Promised Land. If he finally fails, it is not up to him. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he most trusted. He even makes the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> The image of Wallace is very good and effective. But it really does not inspire or fascinate me. I find human ambiguity far more fascinating than human perfection. Therefore, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings", and that's one of the reasons why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy may be heroic and courageous, but he is anything but perfect. He makes some mistakes that affect the lives of many of his relatives. Now it was safe to make no false allegation against the Duke of Argyll, it was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of selfishness and selfishness. Let us not forget that at the end of the film the relatives whose protection he claimed were homeless because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all he could ask of him. Rob's wife Mary is also a normal, ambitious person. Let's start with what she looks like in this movie. Sure, she's beautiful, but she does not wear any make-up and basically reveals her natural beauty. Compare this to the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of William Wallace in Braveheart. Now these two ladies are hot, but hardly any indication of what women looked like at the time (especially the laity). Maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's accuracy tests are far more effective. During "Rob Roy," Mary has to live with her vicious rape by the cunning carrion, Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob about her fight, but she does not because she knows Rob has to take revenge for her rape. Such a revenge would certainly mean the death of Rob, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The bad guys in "Rob Roy" are equally compelling. Although the opponents in "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a man who is both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral choices that are all well known in the fictional field. Should he claim his claim to be King of Scotland or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his surname? Bruce is the most ambitious character in "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II" these characters are hardly original. Longshanks is haunting, but very one-dimensional. He is the epidemic of evil and his tyranny is in direct opposition to Wallace's heroism. <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are wonderful in their magic. Let's start with Marquis of Montrose. He is a man so obsessed with his self-image that he is willing to make an innocent man suffer. "Make sure I'm not ridiculed" are his favorite words to his "factor". He is a man possessed of power, annoyed that a man of great nobility can be regarded as the Duke of Argyll of greater providence than he. He is ashamed self-obsessed and uncertain. He is a bad aristocrat, but in a way that makes him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in "Rob Roy" and also Roy's direct attackers. Callarn is so clever in his coward that he is almost funny. He will do everything to maintain the good will of the Marquis. Cunningham is a convincing character as he was apparently educated to do anything to gain the status and affection of the Marquis. He needs a father, he knows little that the Marquis is his real father. When Callarn gets the opportunity to gain wealth, he takes it without asking. He is very similar to the evil of modern man, so selfish and in vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as overkill. Hogwash, I say. It's clear that throughout the movie Cunningham is not only evil, but also psychopathic. Is Cunningham too much of an incredible character in a world where a man and his stepson can walk around to shoot random people for pleasure? We live in a society where people seem to have lost the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this diminished value have changed. It is a problem in the history of humanity that the vanity of the human heart does not allow the ability to pity. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that the good will prevail, but there are always snakes in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I fascinate is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct opposition to the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct annoyance for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully, people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than 10 of the fight scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <One thing I get tired of is that people say that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the fight scenes. At first, fight scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long history of historic European combat scenes. "Braveheart" has some of the best fighting scenes ever made, but they suffer from a major problem. These battle scenes have no connection except the fight for freedom. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, duels are also hardly original. In fact, there are probably ten times as many dueling films as there are fighting scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to be seen. It's one of the biggest scenes in film history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First, the fighting style and attitude of the two characters in this duel perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is efficient and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broadsword. Cunningham struggles with fast tricky moves, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The entire movie, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, leads to this moment. It's a powerful stuff, and it's clear that Rob must eradicate this menacing evil that has plagued his entire world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively), this is one of the biggest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live on and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham's. The use of music is absolutely daunting in this scene. To rule well against a real evil is more powerful for me than to see a guy being kidnapped just for the sake of "FREEDOM!" Can call. But hey, maybe that's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know that people in the aristocracy or Scots like to talk to people in "Rob Roy", but I feel it is clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel like many people are bored with "Rob Roy" simply because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, read some Shakesphere or put the subtitles on. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the biggest written movies of the 90s. Many dialogues in this film are smart, but you may need to watch the movie a few times to understand it. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is hardly interesting. What do you expect, of course, if the main character is a Scot played by an Australian? This is a legend, and there was obviously no attempt to record the speech of the time. This movie takes several centuries before "Rob Roy", yet they talk like the people of today. The reason that many people like it better. The audience has become increasingly lazy these days and does not want to take the time or the patience to understand complex things. As with many epic films, they therefore expect the villagers to speak a recognizable English accent, while the heroes speak in a vernacular that is not too far from our American language. Sure, it's clear the Wallace is Scottish, but apart from Scotty from Star Trek and some "Aye's" for recognition, the Scots in this movie fit into the Hollywood tradition, as we believe Scots should sound. <br /> <br /> Do these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Barely. But if it proves one thing, it shows that it's hardly common knowledge that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy." Put simply, "Rob Roy" is a movie whose themes are very favorable in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspired but barely realistic. You can decide what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Note - A rating - 9
