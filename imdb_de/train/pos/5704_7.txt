To be fair, I expected chases in this movie. There really was only one, but otherwise 'Freeway' was a great movie that I like to have on DVD. The only really big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and B-movie villain Billy Excago, who is cited as a Revelation Freeway killer. The rest of the cast generally performs well. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character Sunny a bit of courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she's completely round when she tracks down Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. Russo, I'm afraid, seems pretty wooden, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, except for a backstory, is not very well crafted. Sunny is given by his former commander. The tone of the threat is superbly maintained throughout the movie. The atmosphere of the lonely LA highway at night, when the killer runs through his sinister gray sedan, is an excellent way to build tensions, and the music that underlines the film is aptly composed. I do not know why there are people who hate this movie so much. I suppose different strokes for different people. "Freeway" but I really liked it and I highly recommend it.
