In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America, and it deserves every award won, and it's on the AFI Top 100 list (though shamefully too low in the IMDB Top 250 list, only at # 183) of this letter). If you like to work at the highest level (Voight and Hoffman are an excellent game), well-drawn characterizations and inventive directing, editing and film, you'll love it as much as I do. Schlesinger draws a vivid, ever believable image of the late 1960s scene in New York City, and there are many victims struggling to overcome personal demons amid the amorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street in New York City to survive. <br /> <br /> The film techniques used here brilliantly capture the feeling of underground New York film movement (and the city) and are no less than dazzling. I have seen many ideas (including the speed of editing, handling the voice-over flashbacks, the drug / trip sequences, and the caricature face that came in during a murder scene to convey fear and terror) stolen by other filmmakers , <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way that it is regarded as unusually strong friendship or has homosexual foundations. I think the director has subtly dealt with it, not to censor time, but to focus his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, be it sexual or not. <br /> <MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a bold, moving movie with a size, influence and meaning that has lost nothing of its impact over the years. So if you have not seen it, you will miss a real American classic. I can recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
