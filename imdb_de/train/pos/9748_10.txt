I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 and still in classic rock (still) ... <br /> <br /> I've never liked opera because I hate soprano voices, but he changed all that. He was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died of pancreatic cancer at home tonight, he will be missing and he has definitely left his mark on this world movie if I can find, watch and enjoy it , * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and have a look before it's sold out.
