I loved the whole work of Cream, although there is such a small and valuable catalog of works that it can tackle. Even if they work with some of their songs for twenty minutes (Spoonful and Toad off Wheels of Fire are the best examples), the socks of more than half of a rock act working today are still rocking. This ability to band together on stage is what makes them one of the most anticipating rock band reunions last year with their shows at the Royal Albert Hall. They may have gotten older like their fans, but the energy is still there, with great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own. The images of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love do not seem to be missing. Clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes does not have when he's on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, enough said. Jack Bruce is stable enough with his vocals and a power that Clapton would never have alone. Conclusion: If you want to see the best shows you've ever wanted last year (some may already have seen them), you'll find this DVD with cool special features.
