"The Color Purple" is really amazing. There are no people who like it that way, and I do not think there will ever be one. It is a role of emotions and pain that the viewer perceives. The actors are immaculate and the direction is outstanding. I absolutely loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It's nice, that's the best way to explain it.
