Really enjoyed this little movie. It is a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and, above all, friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Miki is especially good). There are so many large-format impersonal films filmed around World War II that this convincingly narrated little story represents a genuine departure from the norm and an original one. I add that this movie is anything but boring, very far !! Of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. For anyone who actually treats his pet as part of the family (I do), this movie will be especially rewarding. Recommended for movie fans looking for something different.
