Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural abyss between an indigenous population and the invading white man. Although Eskimo has been filmed in a documentary that seems to be dealing with nonprofessionals, Eskimo is a highly skilled production that contains a credible story that the audience wants to see through behaviors about women and life as the whalers who want to see through to the end Darken the landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his partner, it is natural for other men to share their wives with their friend. It is also common for their wives to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this appears natural in the context of the desolate, predictive Arctic backdrop. The trusting Eskimo falls victim to the unscrupulous white whalers (with strong European accents) who do not consider them as equals. Fraud, drunken orgies, rape and death occur after the Eskimo men leave for work in the icy seas. Eventually, the leading Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been cheated and he takes his revenge. The audience could have cheered in the thirties cinemas. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of bringing Mala to justice. The Mounties are played as felt policemen who know that this is not a dry fall. Will the Mounties get their man? Is it fair to tie Mala to a code of conduct outside its traditional society? Is there a way out that will not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the law of the white man must apply? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but a movie you will enjoy for the depth of the problem in a very different environment. I suspect that filming the sequences with animals was done before today's disclaimer, that no people were injured when creating the movie - so beware of the raw natural sequences. Highly recommended.
