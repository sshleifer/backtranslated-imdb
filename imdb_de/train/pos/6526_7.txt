I've always enjoyed seeing it on TV every year during prime time in the '60s. It is a typical Hollywood epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies. But it's a fun movie and a good looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film at the end of his life. His son-in-law, Anthony Quinn, who starred in Belly in '38, is the director of his directorial debut and swan song, having never before Film turned and would never again. DeMille gathered a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn, including longtime DeMille associate producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon, who oversaw the project. Among the 10 bids are scriptwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, stage directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, who received the only Oscar nomination from The Buccaneer as a costume design team. A great cast here of Team DeMille, led by Yul Brynner as Pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. The cast also includes Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. With a little more than two hours, it goes down in some places, but makes up for it with some excellent fight scenes. I would give it 7.5 out of 10.
