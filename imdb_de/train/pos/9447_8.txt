Drama of four men on a canoe weekend along a remote river. They are the pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), the adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), the obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and the nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are awesome - there's an incredible duel-banjos sequence, an interesting interplay between characters and just awesome wide-screen movies by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two Hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One rapes Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The landscape is unbelievably beautiful, but this terrible violence is taking place. To be honest, the rape of Beatty has never bothered me - I'm well aware that despite her good acting, she's being faked. This film also shows how the characters are changing - Ed has tested his pacifism, Lewis is weakening, Bobby is hurt by one of the people he has previously ridiculed, and Drew is trying to keep himself healthy. The direction of John Boorman is also very confident and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely. <br /> <br /> The show is usually good. Voight is fine at the top - he was better. Beatty is only okay - but it's his debut film and he has the courage to take such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things are falling apart. And Reynolds is just great - one of his best jobs ever! How that was not even nominated for an Oscar escapes me. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too believable Hillbillies. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for kids. Try to watch an uncut version - the TV version will be slaughtered. Even looking at letters is essential to capture the breathtaking images.
