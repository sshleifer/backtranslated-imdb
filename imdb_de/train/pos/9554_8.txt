Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood as it lacks the values ​​of the "social commentary" that many films of the day (1969) require successfully. <br /> <br /> The characters are supreme satires of everyday people and for that purpose played by all actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines particularly brightly like Lord Foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot contains the usual stuff of the 18th century; false identities, thwarted romance novels, corrupt government officials and jokes around every corner. <br /> <br /> It answers the questions: What happens when 4 wild party-eager guests vacation in a small British seaside town? And with whom do you get involved and how does everything turn out? <br /> <br /> Despite the poor work at the box office, it has great costumes and excellent music (based on the eponymous Mermaid Theater musical), great live performances and of course authentic sets. <br /> <br /> That it was not released on VHS or on DVD is really a shame as so many bad movies are released every day.
