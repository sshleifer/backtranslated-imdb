Belushi at his best and Courtney Cox in front of friends plays a small role. I often believe that Belushi is under-exploited in Hollywood and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his television program, this is a very different and likeable character. The film itself neither shakes the earth nor is the message new, but it is sweet and lovable. The supportive cast of familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, though Lovitz 'whining can get tiring and Michael Caines charming spiritual leader has a somewhat scary, if not benevolent, advantage. Unfortunately, as Belushi's wife, Hamilton is two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not very convincing with the "Prom Queen" who got away. Still a nice way to spend two hours.
