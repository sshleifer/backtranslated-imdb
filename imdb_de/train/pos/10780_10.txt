Far from my second favorite animated cartoon Spielberg has done after Animaniacs. Even though the ratings were low, which I enjoyed and loved, was so funny and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and just fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker , <br /> <br /> I would like to see this cartoon again, was so great and the jokes were brilliant. I also remember the funny moment Brain Cameos was in, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental. That was simply fantastic. I love it in these cartoons when cameos appear. I loved her
