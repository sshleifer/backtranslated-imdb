This movie is wonderful. What sets it apart from other fifties science fiction is the fact that the alien has no facial features, no face, no eyes and nothing, but he can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie is not about a few days running, but on a night that supposedly continues beyond midnight. You are stuck in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My ever popular sci-fi movie of the 50s, and what is sometimes considered quintessential. I can see why Steve McQueen became so famous. All this and a catchy title song! How can you be wrong?
