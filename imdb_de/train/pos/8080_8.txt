Well, after a while, I get used to reading comments on these films that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous films. He was a hardened villain, a villain without apology. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role in which his villainy was in some ways not underestimated. <br /> <br /> The boy who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. I think maybe the director could have done better. To be honest, Shernaz Patel was the best part of this movie. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I have to say that I valued her contribution when she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She has little to do, but she does everything with complete conviction. I'm sure she sailed most viewers right over their heads. <br /> <br /> So if you've got used to choosing the Bollywood average, you will not get much out of this movie. However, if you are constantly looking for something more, you may get some of what you missed.
