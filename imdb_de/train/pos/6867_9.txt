I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I first saw Groove Tube in 2001 when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found her hilarious. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks something can become "outdated" 30 years later, that's not funny. It's funny, even if you have no idea what the '70s were like, and the thought of wearing bell pants makes you flinch. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown guy reading adult literature? There is a lot to laugh about. The scrotal puppetry in the end is the best.
