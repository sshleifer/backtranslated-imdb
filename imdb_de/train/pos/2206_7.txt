Do not believe all the negative reviews this movie gets. Yes, it is cheap. Yes, the Gore is ridiculous. And yes, the action is below average. This is, however, a textbook example of an early Slasher strip, and if this is your "thing" (it's mine!), Then you'll enjoy it. There are enough good aspects in this film to more than compensate for the disadvantages. First, the score of the then unknown Christopher Young is very scary and emphasizes the violence perfectly. The end is a welcome break from the predictable opening credits of most movies. And last but not least, it is the frame that made the film for me. The creators of this film could have done much better to put on the set to make it more credible as a dorm. However, if you can overlook this mistake, the setting is great. Four colleagues alone in a huge, abandoned, condemned building, just waiting to be demolished. Allow your imagination to do something, and you can enjoy this movie as much as I do.
