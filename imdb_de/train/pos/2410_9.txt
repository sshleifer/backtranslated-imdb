This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. It does not want to tell the whole story, but only an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is dark, playful and seriously faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and modern biblical interpretation. Judas is much more ordinary than other representations, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a grossly deceived man, terribly misguided in his eagerness. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, loyal and dedicated - very human and at the same time divine. The final dialogue is thoughtful and serves as a kind of small talk that two powerful men could make if they have just committed cruelty. I would watch this movie again and recommend it.
