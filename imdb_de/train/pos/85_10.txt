I saw this movie in 1975 at Birmingham Southern College when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dreamlike quality. The bulk of the movie is that a fish happily floats in its bowl while its new owner, a little boy, is at school. A cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to carefully track his "prey." The boy starts his way home from school and the viewer wonders if he will arrive on time to rescue his fish friend. The fish is excited by the presence of the cat and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly goes to the fish, lifts it gently with his paws and brings him back to his bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, no one is smarter. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing in its irony and its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director would have been able to expand the technical masterpiece in 1959 - it seems more of a trick for 2003 to be disappointed! And if you find it, let me know, so I can get a copy too!
