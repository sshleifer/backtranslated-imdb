In Manhattan, American middle-class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. Jim works in an advertising agency and collects $ 15,000 annually. He feels uncomfortable in his apartment for reasons of space. When he sees an advertisement for a huge house in the state of Connecticut at an affordable price, he drives with his wife and estate agent and decides to buy the old house without technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a friend to inspect the house, and the man tells him to turn off the house and build another. Jim checks the information with other engineers and everyone condemns the place, and sooner he realizes that he has bought a "mine of money" instead of a dream home. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his own house" An extremely funny comedy with funny lines and a first-class script. Cary Grant is weird in the role of a man moved by the urge to achieve with the American dream of owning a huge house that has made the bad choice while losing touch in his work and jealous of his Friend is. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie that was visibly inspired in this lovely classic "The Money Pit". My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, my agony")
