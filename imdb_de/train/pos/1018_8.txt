The film was below average, but this TV pilot provides a great springboard into an ideal program for sci-fi fans. The performers deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. A smart interesting script does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
