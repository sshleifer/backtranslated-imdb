I loved this show ... smart action, smart dialogue, great action with real people .... please bring them back or make them available online ... really miss them ... Hope Davis shines in this show really. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Get rid of these stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance. Please bring it back. Not to dig ... but please! When it was broadcast from the air, I looked online and I liked how I could see it with minimal interruptions. In fact, ABC makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them at prime time. Whenever you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
