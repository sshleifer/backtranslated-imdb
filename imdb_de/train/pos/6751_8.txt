Pretty good movie by Preminger; At times labyrinthine, she explores scenes and settings from different angles and perspectives, as if it were a nature film about the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays the lead role, as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost increases it to the tragedy. Gene Tierney is attractive as a girl, but unremarkable. Gary Merrill is a very interesting villain whose natural warmth is a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness. His smiling, amiable villain seems to constantly challenge his nemesis by the mere fact that he is emotionally open, unlike the closely wounded and moralistic policeman who persecutes him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this film, which seems temporary to all concerned. For director Preminger, it's a kind of reunion with his Laura stars Andrews and Tierney, who have crossed their careers around the time the film was made. The minor cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic as they were all on the way up. Preminger, as a bright observer as always, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, since the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems to be larger and archetypal than any movie it could contain, much less determination. <br /> <br />
