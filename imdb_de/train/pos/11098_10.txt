Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos. he died when he was shot in the eye. This was the best and well orchestrated scene of all sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone will follow Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can not take it anymore. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3: denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will live on forever. Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I can recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and good direction and production because it's no better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
