The film never claims to be special, as is the case with many films. The movies are a fun and entertaining time. And that was it. It is the Korean version of a male bring it on. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you can feel the rest of the movie and know how it will end, but the enjoyment is not in the surprising twists The way the movie is a copy of another. Instead, enjoyment is kept on the journey as the two remaining "thugs" became men. Therefore, the movie is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The camera work, especially the dolly movements were done very well. The script, a bit weak, was overly enjoyable as the characters were not two-dimensional, but full of life and yearning. This movie will not win Oscars or DVD blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and entertaining experience.
