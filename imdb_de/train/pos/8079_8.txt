Not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO BY OTHER RATINGS! This was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can actually put together a really good movie. AB / Akshay gave another great example of acting, as well as bhoomika, which was a little unexpected but great to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there was not much hype about release. <br /> <br /> Or Filmfare / other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better than Khakee, I thought and thought Khakkee was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> Is a pretty long movie, but definitely worth it In any case, it seems to be long. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the next RKS movie and the next AB, Akshay movie, which they always seem to be getting along well with each other ... eg waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also done well in the movie and should really be doing well if she continues in the same way in the future.
