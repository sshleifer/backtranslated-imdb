Death trap is not a whodunit. It is one who will do it first. It's so hard to describe this film without giving away, so I do not mention anything about the plot. As far as acting is concerned, Cris Reeves plays the biggest role as Clifford, a young playwright. You can really see the range of his acting skills in this film, from exhaling cheeseburgers to really frightening ones. Clifford is a very difficult role and in stage production I've never seen Clifford play well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a small puppy or as a blackjack. Reeves is the only person I've seen who's right all the way through. As for Michael Caine, so he is ..... Well, he is Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this movie as good as never before.
