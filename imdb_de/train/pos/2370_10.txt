It's a great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for an American movie from the 90s. Of course the fight scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong movies. In fact, few American films have battle scenes that are as good as Honk Kong films, even today. If you watch an American martial arts movie you expect less impressive fighting scenes, but still have some nice features that can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least I expect these films. I was impressed by this movie. Some fight scenes were really impressive, the acting, the directing and the plot were good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie if you like American martial arts movies of the 90's.
