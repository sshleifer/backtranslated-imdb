If you can not enjoy a chick movie, stop immediately. However, if you enjoy movies that depict complex characters and provide extraordinary spectacle, read on. Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters come to her bed. Ann begins to talk about people from her past, whose daughters know nothing, and they wonder if these lost acquaintances are real or imaginary. They become aware that these people from the past are really real to their mother. The story essentially changes between 1953 and about 2000, with Ann receiving some insights into Ann's life between those years. In 1953, Ann learned the love of her life and experienced the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> Lila, one of Ann's best friends, is married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret artist living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of these fifties conventions. Soon after Ann arrives at the wedding of Lila's wedding, she meets the person who will become the key figure in the Three Harris' life. He is the adult son of a former servant of the family, who grew up with Lila and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann immediately falls in love with Harris, which makes the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris even more complicated. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but since 1953 he has passed on this homosexual desire for Harris to his good friend Ann because he can not admit that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy externally exposes his inner frustration by being the alcoholic, wise-wicked boy of the family - much to the chagrin of his very neat and well-mannered parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all this expresses itself and is suppressed Emotions lead to a tragedy - after all, this is a chick movie. At the present time, Ann's daughters are away from her mother and suffer from her own life accomplishments and doubts. Constance is working on emotional exhaustion and trying to maintain her role as a perfect mother and wife. Nina, who has always felt inferior, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships over a period of fifty years, and you get a fascinating view of society, its values ​​and its impact on the personalities and actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> The entire Acting in Evening is outstanding, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this movie so special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann in the 50s, and that's what she does in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of the time, who disagrees with what she wants to do from what she wants to do wants to do. Your appearance is not so easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann, whose head shifts from the present into the past, to flights of fantasy, and Redgrave pulls everything off with sterling-style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter Constance in the movie. The scenes between this mother and her daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are a sensational treat. Toni Collette plays the other daughter of Ann, Nina. Nina spends a lot of her time being depressed and regretting herself while hiding a good man who loves her as much as she loves her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part like this, but I've never experienced a bad or incredible performance, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays the 50s Lila and shows us a woman who gets even more conflicted with her expected role in life than her good friend Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays today's purple. What is there to say about Meryl Streep, unless she always gives a revealing and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai says in the DVD extras that he chose Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress to whom he was only one scene in the movie could play. He was certainly right, and the performance of Close in this one scene makes you think. All the other scenes where Close is the real mother of Lila, and you get another performance that you appreciate. <br /> <br /> There are three more scenes in the movie, combined with the scene described above with Close The whole movie is worth it. On Lila's wedding Ann comes to her room and crawls to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misunderstandings about her upcoming wedding with a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila crawls into bed with her dying girlfriend Ann to talk about her life. In this final scene, Streep and Redgrave are captivating. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy explains his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking idea of ​​a young man being torn apart by his contradictory sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> chick film? Yes. A very special movie with incredible acting, directing and scenery? Certainly. I can not recommend the evening too much.
