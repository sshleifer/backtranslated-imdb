The main characters in this film can be divided into two categories: intelligent and stupid. Very easily. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unfortunate, stupid guy who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to be financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation gets out of control. <br /> <br /> While Standa is really (but adorable) stupid, his buddy Ondrej is an absolute bubbly idiot who chatters everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa could have a chance to go through life with modest success. With Ondrej life will never be boring, but it certainly will not be without a headache! Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, a wicked genius-type who turns into a Hitler maniac. Zdenek and his followers try to kill Standa to protect Zdenek's secrets. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed by the high quality and the imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than just its share of outstanding entertainment. The best Czech movies I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you watch these two films, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.
