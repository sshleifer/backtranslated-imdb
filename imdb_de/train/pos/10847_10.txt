I'm 60 years old, guitarist (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years I've been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the dirty heads, the lazy food, the poorer accommodation, always on the go, little or no Money, and everyone was drunk or tall. But the clubs, the fans and the music were worth it! How strange fruits! I'm too old for it now, and the arthritis in my hands and hips is no longer shaking, but for the duration of this video, everything came back and it was all there! The birds, the brawls and the schnapps! And I was young again! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes the '70s stuff! Rock forever!
