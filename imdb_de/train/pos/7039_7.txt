War Inc. is a funny, but strange movie. The actors are sympathetic, the film is nice too, but I can not describe the plot. I will go into the story later. This is a movie with weird casting options. Next to John Cusack as a hit man, whom we saw blank in Grosse Point years ago, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here's Hilary Duff, a Russian pop star called Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is strange. There is a scene in which she puts a scorpion in her pants. And meets Hauser (Cusack). In the end, there is a twist between the two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> That's the only casting choice I'm aiming for. Because it's just weird. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny and I never got bored. Here are some of the best actors. Miss Duff excepted. She is not that great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Do you see what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hit called Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a city in the Middle East to meet an oil man named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his personal issues, he must support the wedding of a pop star (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). The pop star has something. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene where she sings a song to him and then he sucks. <br /> <br /> The phrase at the end of the film reveals why. The thing about the twist is that I saw it coming somehow. That does not matter. This is a strange, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most actors. So, how can I not recommend it? War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
