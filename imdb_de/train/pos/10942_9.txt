I would give this show ten out of ten, if it were not for the fart jokes. Your people are so damn sensitive that it's crazy! So quick to point out the "racism" of the show and the jokes, but also to say so fast, ridiculously sexist, hogwash like "well, some of those other shows make those jokes at least so much better." They have hot women. Abortion jokes are great, because who takes abortion really seriously, at least I'm not a * boring * son, I've heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are working together to make a movie about sisters doing a road trip together. Talk about a movie of the year!
