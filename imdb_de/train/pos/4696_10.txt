Even though this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> A certain quote in the movie is striking. When Danny (Joe Piscopo) drives into Da's office and parked in a disabled area, Danny's partner says it can not be parked here. "Danny replies," I'm disabled, me am psychotic ". <br /> <br /> That's one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you see it's I'll make you giggle. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands in As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle cast. Watch this movie and like me and many others who love it you will be amazed.
