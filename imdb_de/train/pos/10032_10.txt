I've loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend to see everyone. It's a movie that you can watch with your family by far. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, longer catastrophic scenes, nudity / sexuality and some language.
