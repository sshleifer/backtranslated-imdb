Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very much like the phenomena that we see today (in the '70s - more than ten years later - there were endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star, put a nice point in Jack Lemon's curriculum vitae, illuminated Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore in their careers (both continued to play witches and other curious "old bats"), in film and television). <br /> <br /> Together with the 1940s film I Married a Witch (which made Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great fascination of film and television things who began with "Bewitched" and continued with "Practical Magic," "Worst Witch," and "Harry Potter." What I've rarely noticed is that the movie is also a pretty interesting alternative Christmas movie Christmas holidays and, though superficially about witchcraft, embodies a lot of Christmas spirit (bestowal, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will see this movie again and again (have it since my e First visit in the early 90s seen several times), especially when he is shown near or shortly after Christmas. It has style, substance, a good cast and excellent production values. And like Adam's rib, he casually expresses ideas that were quite radical in his time and are still radical (in both films, the female figure is innocent and powerful) and therefore seems to always be ahead of the times.
