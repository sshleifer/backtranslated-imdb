What a real pleasure and totally unexpected. That's what a real thriller movie is all about. I rushed into the video store, grabbing a movie without reading all the blurb on the back, hoping for the best. I was totally surprised and excited. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all did a great job and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. It has interested you from start to finish and never got boring. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for those who like thrillers, especially thrillers who have a good pace and those who keep their attention. In any case, a 10 out of 10 points from me.
