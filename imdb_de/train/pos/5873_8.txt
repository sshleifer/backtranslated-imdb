This would have been a safe classic if they had chosen almost Elends Else for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tears, etc. He stinks. It seemed as if Priyadarshan had recognized this at some point, jumping around like a monkey to make his solo scenes a bit funny, otherwise a few annoying treats) from an ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie. Best comedy in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a sit-down comedy worn on the shoulders of a brilliant script, and of course Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance so far. He should be a shoe for the best comedian at every awards ceremony. AK has always been a good comedian, but he takes it to another level. The body language, the facial expressions, and the way he delivers each line. It is a brilliant achievement. The crowded theater was crazy for the entire length of the movie, and I do not think I've seen such an atmosphere here in the US for a Bollywood movie. Garam Masala not Have a "leading" heroine. It has 3 unbelievably hot stars + Beautiful girls that I thought were doing pretty good work. Pretty sure they will all make their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, though his routine wears off after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typically annoying self (in each movie fed up with his exaggerated plot). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's funnier than No Entry, and that says a lot. Could have been even better if they had selected someone more proficient than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
