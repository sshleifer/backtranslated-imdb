I used this movie in a religious class that I taught. The golden fish happily floats in his bowl in an apartment upstairs. A little boy and his mother are not at home. The boy got money to buy milk. On the way home he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him is a man in a black suit who looks a bit scary. The boy drops the milk bottle. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene changes with what happens at home. A black cat climbs onto the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Discover the fish bowl and watch her. The fish swims vigorously and jumps out of the bowl. Meanwhile, a few teenagers are in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish in the bowl. The double story includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a great discussion starter in my class.
