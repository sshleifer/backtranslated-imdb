Here's a proof why Mary Pickford was "America's Sweetheart". In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of a squatter, who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "mountain tops". The scenes in which they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply adorable. She is even ready to take a bath. That Mary was able to do this role at the age of 30 is simply unbelievable and somewhat because of her small size (5 '). Tess faces many physical and emotional challenges. She does this with sperm, which was not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess grabs a bunch and is not afraid to fight someone. Why she agrees to help the daughter of Hill-topper is unclear to me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close-ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Born in Denmark, Jean Hersholt is a wonderful villain. The scene in which he treats a little baby is enough to throw vegetables (or whatever) on the film screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) wore a beard, would he have been a breeze with the model of World War I that poster Uncle Sam sets? Wants you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is initially somewhat predictable and slow, investing in your time is worth it to see the play or the pure Americana. The film highlights the selection that is available to all of us. It's about making someone happy and what it means to be a true Christian. Recommended.
