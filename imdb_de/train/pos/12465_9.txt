I definitely recommend reading the book before the movie. This book was awarded the 1978 National Book Council Award and is a very poignant read (pun not intended). It is not too hard to read for those who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of relationships more than the film, and the film becomes more meaningful after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne, I really could relate to this book and this movie. There were very few Australian women writers in the 1970s, so little is known about the way a woman lives in a city in Australia during this time or class. It is a valuable piece of Melbourne history. It is a shame that it is documented as a kind of soft movie of the 80s. It's a long way from that and as the other reviewer mentioned, please do not read the DVD case, it does not show what the movie is about. Those who rent the film based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was shot in 1982. So do not expect the Hollywood dramatization they seem to be integrating these days. I like that. It's also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in that role, she's just fantastic as Nora and it's great when she really plays it, because when you're near my age, you'll love her for playstools and games Better Homes and Gardens remember. Who knew that she hid that talent? This film will give you a completely new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
