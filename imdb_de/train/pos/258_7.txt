Between San Francisco and Captains Courageous, two of Spencer Tracy's biggest pieces, is this very curious film about the war and the impact it has on some people. They gave him A Gun Stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they ever shot together, and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. Tracy and Tone are a few conscript from the First World War. Tone is a feeble character who almost goes over the hill in a boot camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing the lovable, shiny, younger Wallace Beery guy MGM intended for him when they dropped him off Fox. <br /> <br /> At the front of the front, Tone gets a chance and realizes it, if he manages to get to a church tower during a fight looking down on a German machine gun's nest. He's learned how to shoot and makes a sergeant York. But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war, as Tone did. <br /> <br /> Wound in combat Tone enjoys a hospital where Gladys George is looking for him. Tracy goes to his buddy himself and he and George get things going. Later, when Tracy is reported missing, Tone and George marry. Tracy is broken when he comes back and learns about the marriage, but he takes his step. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the film deals with Tone, who uses the learned war skills in gangster trading. He's a hit man now and George does not really know what he's doing professionally. I think you can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that caused me some problems is that I can not believe that Gladys George could not understand it. She is a straightforward girl, her role is very similar to the role she played in The Roaring Twenties over James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development is similar to that of Tone, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, elements of They Gave him a weapon that can be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences from the First World War are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin disturbed this movie, I think it's a lot better than he appreciated it.
