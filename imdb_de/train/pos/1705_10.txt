"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this movie did not get better critics, it's funny, harmless and cute. I first looked at it when I was 11 and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later I got it on VHS :-P To this day I have shown it to many friends, and it everyone liked, but nobody knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost nobody knows it, so almost no one likes it ... This movie never had a real chance, that's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say is, if you ever want to laugh your head off, look on! Even if you are not upset about it, take a look! -> Prepare for laughter, Earthfoam!
