24 must be the best spy / adventure series TV has ever aired. The idea of ​​telling a story within 24 hours is stunning. The style of filming and pacing is what prevents us from seeing it. And Jack Bauer has long been one of the biggest protagonists of a television series. I rate this together with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three most popular TV series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate US Senator David Palmer, who also runs for president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all this, and at the same time to find his daughter's path to becoming an orphan after fled her bedroom. So an adventure begins with the best of political style, and the best part is that it always happens in real time, making this television series a true work of originality, in a time when almost every program on TV seems to us the same things over and over again.
