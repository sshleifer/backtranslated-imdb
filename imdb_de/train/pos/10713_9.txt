An angry boy who tragically lost his parents is taken care of by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folktales, which were passed on orally from generation to generation of the islanders. Although tragic episodes such as the Highland Clearances are included in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and happiness in them. It's all shot in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking and it is a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic. I am English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the tone of the spoken Gaelic is still wonderful. The performances are exactly what you would expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you observe the real - people who are deeply involved with Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, has done countless small miracles to make this film. Anyone with the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should visit this film.
