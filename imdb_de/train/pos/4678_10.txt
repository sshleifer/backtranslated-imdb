I chose this movie from Tribeca, based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen, and found it one of the festival's best films. Both protagonists provide a well-rounded sensible performance that seems to suit the characters on a personal level. The director has done a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is not normally seen in a first production. An interesting aspect of this film is the love of Wood and New York City (Brooklyn in detail). The film revolves around the family-owned furniture maker, weaving filigree cinematographs of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life. Again a big compliment to the director about this good choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I would wholeheartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).
