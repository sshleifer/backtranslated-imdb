This movie is wonderful. It always would be like this. I really mean something better than a maid who falls in love. Walt has really done himself here. And the music! A dream is a wish that makes your heart beautiful! What else can you say except terrific? I can not wait for the Special Edition to come out, it's going to be so great! I can not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is so beautiful and smart! It is lovely. What's with the cute mice too! I know, I say the same things over and over again, but hey, that's a great movie! Woods was great in this beautiful, beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
