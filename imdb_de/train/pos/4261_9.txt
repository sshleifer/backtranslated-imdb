I loved this movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he counts in practically all German films. But also because he is NOT the main actor. The guide is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to look at Julietta from 2001, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders. (that's my own invention and irony ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. In the end, however, they open a restaurant and the journey that the movie takes to this point is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From then on, the story is mainly told by the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker threatens his rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and completely neutral - view of life that can be shaped by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie does not say which life (Gigi's or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It only gives us a worthwhile look at what it must be like to look for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. And this look is not driven by bitterness or contempt for any country, making it a great movie for any country that deals with the tensions of immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved from Turkey to Germany in the 1970s also gives this film a high degree of credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast, especially Metschurat and - I must stress that - the little boy who plays the young Gigi. The performance of this child would be a difficult act for everyone! Great movie, look at it.
