Wow, how can I even talk about this movie without tears in my eyes? It was certainly the highlight of my year - no - of my life. As if the Raptor graphics were not amazing enough, the award-winning editors throughout the movie always used the same setting, even if the background did not really fit the scene scenario. Wow, what a genius. And while the film is full of action gaps (for example, a few clips of a T-Rex animal where a bird of prey should be, and a key moment in which Pappy finds a torture chamber, "Colin's a girl!" Screams) And runs away) Me never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet. Thanks sci-fi for another classic.
