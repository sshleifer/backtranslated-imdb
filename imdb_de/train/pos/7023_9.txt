I loved the fact that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer and allows the layers to move away from the characters through their interactions over the unspoken loss that has so affected each one of them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a beautiful film and is an inspired reflection on the vision of a human being whom I believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insights to make a story to reach out to others who have failed with much more experience. I see a bright future for this author / producer / director, who had the ability to focus on one goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
