In my 60th year, I've learned that identifying a movie (whether we like it or not) is implicitly linked to a certain character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, because the character performs a certain gesture sometimes, because the character speaks a certain word or phrase? that we use or that we want to use? In certain situations. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be seen from this point of view. Who can find a parking space now? in a mall, in the city center or on the street - grabbed by a car that the driver can not believe is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who does not have the urge to "gummi raus" the bad-hearted spit? <br /> <br /> Haven said, I ask: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES !, then do not try to find absurd details? comparable to the reality of life? in the movie, because you certainly find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you make abstractions, you'll find that the movie has some surprising moments, such as: 1- In the order Della packs the box of tools in the trunk (this box contains a gun and does she have the courage to use her?); 2- In the order in which Terry dies falling; 3- In the order in which Della is attracted by Chuckie's "Call of the Mermaid". <br /> <br /> If you've already seen the movie or are planning to see something, remember that there are "realistic" movies. "Fiction" films, "political" films and movies in which you can wash your soul? To illustrate the last example, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, there was unanimous applause when BOPE representatives take certain attitudes. (As I watched the movie on DVD, I could not determine the audience reaction.) <br /> <br /> As for the director (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer etc .. Edition (William M. Anderson, 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card', Extraordinary Edition, 'Robocop 2', etc.) It is well arranged in context on a scale from 1 (Terrible) to 10 (Master ) Piece, I rate "When she was out" a 7 (Normal).
