Well, there are many ways to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are distracted or too ambitious, often with conspiracy that is absolutely paranoid and unbelievable. But the town hall does not do anything from the above. The plot is sophisticated, the story is believable. As for the characters, I would say that this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is as brilliant as ever. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is stellar and proves once again that Al Pacino is now one of the absolute foremost among American actors.
