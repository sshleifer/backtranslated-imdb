Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animations. As a result, they tend to produce films like these, which eventually end up on anime fan hard drives and college student bottoms, but are ignored by just about everyone outside of their country of origin. Cat soup is one of the films to be experienced or deeply analyzed from the Western eyes with drugs. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed surrealistic journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties who are not interested in subtitles. A cat and its half-dead (brain-dead) sister travel through different landscapes of fantasy and associations. There is a common theme of water or its absence (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning - perhaps because of the title?). There is an interesting genesis. There is a pig that eats itself. An elephant made of water. And it's beautiful, captivating, exciting, and fun - provided you do not see it near Drogies who can not experience anything unique without comparing it to a sour trip. Finally, the movie turns off and adds another convincing self-reflexive level to the process. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
