Another example of what British cinema can do: a simple story that is well told and acted. Brenda Blethyn shows a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially troubled Grace, who is supported by a solid cast. The "quirky town" card is played to the limit, much like many television series and films that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others). Like the previous one, this film uses a beautiful rural landscape, in this case the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will find the general acceptance of cannabis somewhat difficult, while others may end up just a little too sweet and safe. But it's a nice thing to be sure.
