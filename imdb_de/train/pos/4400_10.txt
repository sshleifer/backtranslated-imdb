The star of this movie is the script. The attention to detail in terms of clothing, language, social customs (we do not hurt women) and politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of today's Kosovo. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Maybe this movie is too close to the bones of reality to get the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well-executed breaks and serenity between the steps. A great movie ....
