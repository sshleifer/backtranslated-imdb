Red Eye is not the kind of movie that will win the Palme D'or, but Wes Craven was never such a director anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a movie viewer can expect. <BR> <br /> The fact that the 94-minute Red Eye is a straightforward, unpretentious package is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's craft to produce light-weight, but genius cinemas. In fact, this is the perfect kind of movie that can be shown as entertainment during the flight without the viewer being confronted with intellectual or emotional challenges. All in all, there is a cheesy feeling in the plot, vague terrorist subplot motivation and supportive characters, and the bulk has a television movie feel. There are, however, certain elements of Hitchcock's suspense and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth that are ultimately a more sophisticated (and presumptuous) game with the same notion of emotional crisis being repressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a movie that focuses primarily on two people sitting in airline seats, he lives or dies from the characters and the script. Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and the resourceful Lisa of Rachel MacAdams are the main reasons why the film gets carried away. Not only to shape the dialogue, but also to give the fight of the "male logic" against the feminine "sensitivity" a kind of Adam's Rib type. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the movie Craven indulges a little scream-style as a man-chasing girl with a knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the "Just for Men" treatment, his ubiquitous appearance in such diverse films as Super Troopers, The Ring and this makes him the sex-genre version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short fun.
