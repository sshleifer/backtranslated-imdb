When Paris Burning came out, I totally rejected it. I was not interested in the whole phenomenon of the Madonna and the fashion. I thought it would be campy and stupid. How wrong was this movie? I saw it after the movie stopped running for ten years and I went out and bought it. It brought me to a time and a place of fun and excitement. I felt I knew all the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went to the internet and found out what some of the original performers were doing now, but I could not find all of them. If anyone has information about one of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another documentation. I LOVED IT
