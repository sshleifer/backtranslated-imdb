I think the majority of people do not seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I am not sure if this is a drug abuse movie. It's more like a movie about the thinking of these brilliant brothers, drugs are side effects, a little bit of the edge. It's not a commercial movie you see every day, and if the author wanted it, it definitely failed, because most people think it's one of the many films that relate to drugs. But I think something else is the case. As in many films showing different cultures, the audience usually understands films that represent their own culture, ie. H. Something they grew up with and are quite familiar with. This film is intended to show what these "geniuses" often think and what problems they face. The reason they behave this way is because they are bored. :) You have to meet people who do mediocre things, and accept these things as if they start daily space shuttles. They start a pretty tough job and excel in no time. They feel like I went to work, did nothing, was still twice as good as the guys around me when they had all their projects behind them. What should I do with my free time now? And what is even more boring? If you can predict behavioral predictions, not because you're a psychologist, but because you've seen that pattern in the past. For them, on the one hand, it's a non-challenging job, sometimes quite boring, and from another, they start figuring out people's behavior. It's a recipe for big boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to leave this state. You mentioned earlier that your biggest problem is finding logic logically (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, it's absolutely right.
