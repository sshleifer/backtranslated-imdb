The movie was okay, pretty entertaining. The cast was pretty good and I'll be second, as the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played the selfish "bad" friend and manager of the band brilliantly! <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but that's no surprise. The movie is a VH1 production. However, if you do not like the soft rock / pop music, you can move these scenes just as fast. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band trying to get to the top in LA but overcome it Many obstacles along the way are not too original, but quite entertaining with surprising twists.
