Una giornata particolare is a film that made excellent use of enclosed spaces. In these boring, empty rooms, the audience sees the emotional uproar and the boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two main characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals choosing to get together for a few brief moments of their listless life. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will meet with characters in their vicinity. All men would truly regret the character of Sophia Loren Women would certainly scream their hearts at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight. Hidden sexuality is also one of the main themes of this sombre, poignant film. Most of the characters struggle with questions related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare can not be called sexuality pro-gay movie, although it has been beautifully portrayed that a gay guy mixes well with women. This is a movie that an Italian director is working for Ettore Scola has created a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how Hitler's arrival changed the fate of ordinary Italian peoples. A word about the brave person who was magnificently played by Marcello Mastroianni. He is a real man who does not ask for pity. He happily accepts his fate and prepares for the worst of his short but meaningful life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
