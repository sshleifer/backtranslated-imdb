Taunted in a military school? Hmmmm, sounds weird, for some maybe offensive. You have the characters, the Arab thief, the sex-crazy teen, the clever mouth, the smoker and not to forget the guy who burns things. Throw in a stern, pointless sergeant, a gay sergeant and a sexy ammo teacher, and that makes a crazy movie adventure. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and it's funny because the comedy is about it When you try to work together, things get done. <br /> <br /> This group of inappropriate students of the Vineyard Military School has been placed here because Sgt Liceman quotes "because you're outsiders, embarrassments for your families and communities, shame." One of Ralph Macchio's previous performances before Karate Kid and my cousin Vinny, with whom Barbara Bach also performed, speaks to teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
