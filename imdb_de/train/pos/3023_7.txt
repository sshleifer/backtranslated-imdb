This pleasing minor noir features a top cast and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the total disregard of authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the movie are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And as a coronation Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, all performances are very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speak in completely different accents, is a real shout! And I think since they were alone, they should have spoken in Spanish anyway! It seems pretty weird that the Brothers Warner could not find Spanish-speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood often has the politics of an "old accent" - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have received Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - he would have been big in Boyer's role or at least Franc's role (which would have saved a lot of money on the dark make-up budget).
