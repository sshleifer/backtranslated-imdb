I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and very good looking movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are loveable and well-crafted, but what really shines is the digital-look-setting world in an amazing use of color. Sometimes the touches of reality shimmer through (especially the water was impressive), but still it is a fantasy world based on reality. The inclusion of many landscapes helps to minimize the cost of rendering. Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, these with effective use of technical know-how, technical gossip, the movie is entertaining, family friendly and sometimes just weird.
