The premise may seem stupid, but since Murphy's character does not take him seriously, he helps the audience immerse themselves in this mixture of mysticism and the kidnapping of hardened children. Outstanding cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the height of his 80s comedy / action. There is also a great F / X, a very surreal dream sequence and a pretty original storyline. In the pantheon of Murphy Flicks often overlooked, but this is worth a look.
