I often wonder why this series was hit so hard. I thought it was great and also very well written and performed. I think that in the future it will appear in the light that deserves, that is, if they ever exhibit it. Many up-and-coming young comedy actors performed, and everyone went on to bigger things. Perhaps this fact makes people aware of their value and must be spent. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and last but not least Julian Rhind-Tutt of the extremely successful Green Wing. The authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of modernism. Anyone who can produce a comedy like Father Ted may not be able to write something that is not worth publishing. If it is ever spent, I will definitely buy it.
