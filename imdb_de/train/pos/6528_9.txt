I saw this documentary film at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small cinema with 200 seats at the top of the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely thrilled. I love the mix of fantastically made fictional scenes. It's a great set design. The scenes really look like they were shot in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience at 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoiler ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells the story of great blues men, with black and white, old-looking scenes of the black guitar playing and singing. It is really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands, and I may not like that in this documentary. There are too many links to modern rock bands that play these blues songs in a modern way. I did not appreciate her shabby way of playing such great blues songs. This is the same kind of imperfect taste in music I found at the sight of Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary filmed such a standing ovation at this first show in the small cinema. On this day, this documentary was shown to the public at the outdoor cinema on the beach of the Croisette for everyone and ordinary tourists. The sand, the quality of the projection and the poor sound quality probably made it a difficult experience for the thousands of people who sat in the sand that night.
