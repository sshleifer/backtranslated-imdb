I have seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional. <br /> <br /> The acting is amazing, which is not hard to believe since it's Daniel Day's Lewis, who is an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is the surprise of surprise. She conquers your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who can not walk or talk until he is in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the movie. but I will stop here. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies based on actual events or just enjoying good dramas.
