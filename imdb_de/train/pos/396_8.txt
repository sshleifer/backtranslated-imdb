Legend of Too <br /> <br /> I remember Tsui Hark's original To Warriors, which was made 18 years ago. At Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK screened a week of Hong Kong movies, To Warriors was so captivating and so memorable to a very young viewer and brother that it engraved itself into the memory of the now-grown up sprog ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original To Warriors was one of the first films I saw as a kid, from which I can clearly remember the storyline and the action scenes , And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic flowering. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this remake of To Warriors, there was a sense of concern. Could it surpass the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or will it follow the street of other remakes and die a more terrible death than the bad guys and their broken necks you find in these kung fu movies? <br /> <br / Well, the answer is, I can not say it. That was because this is not a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The legend of To tell of the story of King Sky, a lone warrior whose master Dawn explains her love for him, but her life is taken by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn is reborn as Enigma, and Insomnia has returned to destroy To. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Red are trying to stop Insomnia with the help of King Sky. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists and turns, but it had enough detail to interest me. But I can see this movie as one you either love or hate. The film is very much concerned with the special effects, most of which include several computer-generated environments, similar to the Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that did not outdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing seems rushed - unlike Hero. The backgrounds complemented the acting and by no means overpowered the scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also includes many characters and the mingling of so many individuals makes the movie intriguing. It may have been bordering on "too many cooks," but in general, each character had a part of the story. But some roles, in my opinion, seem to be "extended cameos," and somehow I have to question the need for something. Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film. But I can not say that this film has shown its best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems at least mature in her acting, but she is still pretty raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite their very short role, I have apologized and confess that I have not seen her! <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that this movie was as good as I enjoyed the "original". Since both films were filmed by the legendary Tsui Hark, both films are part of a chronicle that shows how filmmaking in Hong Kong has changed over the course of two decades. And the nice thing is that you can not really compare the two films because apples are apples and pear pears. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, both films are quite pleasing law. And I go back to see the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to see, but not to compare.
