What happens if someone is so afraid of social issues that he stops working? How can a man come alone? If the worldly crap that we have to do to become part of society becomes too much, what happens then? Frownland explores these questions. Definitely a stunning original debut from Bronstein. The sound is weird and claustrophobic when we get into the head of a guy named Keith, so confused that he can barely make a right sentence. We follow him as he tries to connect with people and to function daily. Most of us have known people like this - people who say too much "sorry" or "I appreciate it" when they do not appreciate it. So we know that there are such people, but why would anyone make a movie about it? Well, because it's interesting, and Bronstein and the lead actor, Dore Mann, do a great job. This movie is as uncommercial as a movie can be. A few friends have been filming it over the years, saving money. It was recorded on 16mm and the scratched film look is very cheap. Without a distributor, this could be hard to find. I think the screening was done for the last year or so. Hopefully it will eventually be on DVD. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that tells anything about how funny this movie is. Highly recommended.
