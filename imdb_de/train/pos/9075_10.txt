I missed almost the entire first season, but when the other shows started repeating, I started to look. In the end I bought the entire first season of iTunes. This is one of my favorite comedy shows now. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor makes me roll all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I enjoy the other actors more (without saying that he does not contribute to the show). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked this, give it a try. If you can see the episode where "Jeff" goes to Spermbank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long running time.
