The 40-year-old virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronic shop and has little social life and is very awkward in the woman. Some of his colleagues from the store invite him one night and discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they want to help him lose his virginity. One day, Andy meets a woman called Trish at the store who gives him her phone number, and finally, Andy gets up enough courage to date her and they start to really like each other, but Andy is still very awkward coming to sex, and he'll have to tell Trish, much to his embarrassment, if he can actually muster enough courage to tell her before things get uncomfortable. The 40-year-old maiden has a good direction, a good script, good comedic performances of the entire cast, good cinematography and good movie editing. The film is star and co-author of Steve Carell, who has a very good breakthrough performance and also writes very well for the film. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's cute, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, smart, good-natured and having a good time. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen lately. The 40-year-old maiden really shows a lot of talent and is well used and works as a comedy and romance and is cute and fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
