I saw the movie with two grown children. Although not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. There was no sound in a movie theater surrounded by children in the spring break, so I know the kids liked it all. There, too, the parents seemed to be engaged. The death and apparent death of characters caused the corresponding gasps and comments. I hope people know that this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful, although I liked it too. Personally, I liked the Scrat !!
