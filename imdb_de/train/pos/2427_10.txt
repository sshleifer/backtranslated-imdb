This is really a great, unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s. This film relied on the talent of the actor and was withdrawn. He even had a little comedy, but it was not exaggerated. Once in a lifetime It's what a crime drama should be like, not the typical garbage that sex is thrown into. I especially loved the interracial aspects. <br /> <br /> Now to the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was great when he played a career criminal. Too bad that he is only allowed to show his talent in his own film. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburn's spirited half-brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly flavored film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug king. I have loved his acting since "King of New York". The best drama in the film, however, came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly paired as two of Calderon's followers. Once in a lifetime, Once in the Life is certainly a goalkeeper. **** 1/2 * of *****.
