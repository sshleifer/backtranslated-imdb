The absolute highlight of the oeuvre of the crafty Danish Douglas Sirk (n√©e Detlef Sierck), written in the wind, forces our attention in every colorful setting. From his well-known opening sequence, with the leaves that blew into the baronial foyer of a Texas mansion, and the wind flipping the pages of the calendar into a flashback, the film compresses all the family intrigue that would later lead to Little-Screen - Knockoffs like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years of runs. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is an issue Americans find irresistible in our dollar-based society. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the corrupt, troubled heirs of Hadly's oil wealth; Rockhudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the sensible outsiders trying to close the noisy cauldron. (It's rumored that the story was based on Libby Holman's connection with Reynolds tobacco money.) As always, the outsiders bring the scenery to chew - and the best lines to spit out (Malone in her Oscar nabbing performance as a nymphomaniac with a Jones for Hudson, can explode a whole fireworks display, Hudson, though good, can not compete with all these exaggerated emotions, Bacall starts off sharply, but becomes recessive, a plotting comfort in extravagant hues, Sirk teaches a lesson on how revised melodrama emerges in America's lavish consumer paradise of the late '50s, and no one has ever done better.
