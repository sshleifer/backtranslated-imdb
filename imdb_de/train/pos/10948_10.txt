Following a sitcom act is so recklessly simple that your character simultaneously operates in and out of context. The rest of the cast is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use. The supporting characters establish the show in a sitcom reality that provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's fickle personality, which, beyond the general insensitivity, has no specific recurring traits for behavioral expectations, making it less character than a redrawn canvas every episode has not scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from outside allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to normally go unnoticed. Every time she talks, it's a 5 second sketch. It exaggerates a lot and demonstrates the myriad things that can make a smile or a change in your voice, but never stay with an idea long enough to feel comfortable and formulate expectations that will be met. This is possibly the most creative, original, and experimental television program ever.
