I could write a big comment on each of the characters in Gundam Wing, they could lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 great leads that lead us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains dialogues that you can roll around in your head for months and then go back and derive new meaning of, a masterpiece in screenwriting (though it has the typical anime characteristic of being an inequality between subtitles and English Dub). There are plenty of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. <br /> <br /> The relationships between the cold, unfeeling men and the loving female characters are an independent aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena and Milliardo and Noin is a joy to watch. The apparent rejection of the man is underpinned by an inner turmoil that necessitates love (a word never mentioned in the series) of women in their harsh military environment. The women chase aspects of the men we rarely, if ever, see what makes the leading men all the more puzzling. Heero needs all 49 episodes to show some concern, but he comes there, and when he does, it's a big reward. <br /> <br /> And then the giant robot is fighting. It's fun to see great sequences that are so good in Hollywood's epic battle scenes. Any less enlightened person would see giant robot battles as a dumb cartoon feature for children, as has become clear as I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robotic battles in Gundam Wing contain a tremendous dose of pathos. Usually it's about young rebels fighting for what they believe to be an oppressive society that makes their belief obsolete. Each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring. It is a fascinating, thought-provoking study of the potential of the human mind and the human body.
