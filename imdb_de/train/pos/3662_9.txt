This is a really strange movie - and that's not a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic movie about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I'm sure some may find the movie a bit too weird, but I loved it. This director once again brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great ensemble performance. Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D, both movies have a very similar point - it just makes it in a very absurd way. Ignore the kitschy special effects - after all, they were made in the early 1950s and special effects are not that important anyway (or at least they should not be in movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy the very strange and stupid ride. If you are not a total curbudgeon, you will have a ball. By the way, since I discussed this movie for the first time, I've seen another DeSica-directed movie that's an absolute must THE CHILDREN MONITOR US. Although not a fantasy or mood like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it's still a great movie.
