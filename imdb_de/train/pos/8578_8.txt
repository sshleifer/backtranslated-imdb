This movie is one of the most beautiful American B-movies of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for action, a lot of laughter, and a varied twist on police who fight gangsters, it's worth taking a look. Everyone chews the landscape a bit, but that's what the movie is all about, and they're all pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.
