Diego Armando Maradona was and still is the best footballer the game has ever offered. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This 1986 World Cup documentary will forever remain in the memory of every football fan around the world. Because of his enormous and incredible gate he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no point in making this star smaller. Although I'm not a Spaniard, I appreciate the Argentine narrator. He actually shouts with happiness and can barely express his feelings ... Everything I wrote may be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ... You must watch this to know what I mean.
