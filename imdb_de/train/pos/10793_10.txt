There are a few spoilers in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments I've just read from nativetex4u and a few others, I really enjoyed the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. <Br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris, and though I have to admit some action scenes have stretched the line a bit, the storyline fits in with other weekly series are being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes of running Deke in front of the bad guys after blasting their rockets was full of action. I can not understand that many "pros" were not able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> As for the comment about the need to "put the film in the can to fill the window of time after the playoffs". This film was not originally scheduled for a January broadcast by CBS and the filming was completed in May 2001, just over 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the US. If the author of the commentary had become aware Instead of avoiding the film instead of avoiding it, they might have realized the plot of the story: Rashid, a character resembling Bin Ladin, planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States , The president of the man was called to seek out and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the author should really LOOK at the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
