When I saw Birthday Girl, I liked it so much that I watched every Nicole Kidman movie I could, just to disappoint everyone by comparison. I suspect that the presence of a certain star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of its artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to watching movies - IMHO. For example, Dogville, which deprives the viewer of any imagery to distract the existential insight that beats her home, or other films that promote gay and lesbianism, as worthy of someone else's attention or of others with Kidman related. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. I do not know how or who could hold her back, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays its openness in spite of its resistance brings to the core what makes a woman a woman. And what makes the most desperate hopes of a person easily achievable? <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that male leadership within a movie changes from being a milkseat employee into a macho man sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but its transformation is sufficiently credible. It is not shy, as it would be in a movie that strengthens the male ego. Instead, it records exactly the necessary growth that results from the unique circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> Also, the way criminals are portrayed as completely human except for their criminal mission is very appealing. Their gang has a rough fall partnership that is foreign to American culture. And while they are his opponents, they are never really his enemy. In fact, they teach him to participate in competitions. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that Kidman looks physically Russian. I wondered if her origins were Russian, but none of the photos I examined pointed out. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they will beat her over the head soon so that she can produce another great movie. Despite my unpaid digging on Ms. Kidman, the message is that this is a superior movie in all respects and is probably the role of a life.
