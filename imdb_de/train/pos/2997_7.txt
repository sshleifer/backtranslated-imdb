William Powell is Philo Vance in The Kennel Murder Case, a 1933 film starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson, and Ralph Morgan. A dog show, in which Philo has entered his captain of the Scottish Terrier, serves as background for a locked room secret with too many suspects. The puzzle is very clever and the resolution is both complicated and interesting. Since the talkies are still quite young, the camera work is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz makes the action well. <br /> <br /> The side occupation is excellent; The entire cast brings the movie one step higher. Many actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played most of the time (five times) and is best suited for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to great fame - he had spent about 12 years in film and began his career in 1912 at the age of 20 years on stage. A remarkable man, a notable screen presence and a remarkable actor who was almost 92 years old. We are fortunate that his films are now available on DVD and on TCM. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a funny movie - do not miss it.
