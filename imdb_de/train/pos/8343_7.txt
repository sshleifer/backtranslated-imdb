The Australian Fred Schepisi (A Scream in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and playing in the spring. You will laugh as you watch this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ who gets higher with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell by her dapper shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, you have mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent but not so confident mathematician. Maybe it's because she's surrounded by all this genius. She thinks that if she is someone with a high I.Q. Your children will have a high I.Q. also, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins sweet smile and Meg's cuteness, this is a refreshing movie. I love cute stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to the idiot James Moreland, who works in the behavior of animals, but is very stuffy. This is a love that appears at first glance, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Funny lines and subliminal lines! The cinematography is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With much help from all these brilliant men, Catherine falls in love with Ed, unaware that he is a car mechanic. Favorite Scenes: Ed makes a multiple-choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris release all animals of research! <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart". Ed Walters: "When did he say" Wahoo "the last time?" Catherine Boyd: "I'm sure I do not know". This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape, and from time to time I'll take a look at it again.
