The title is the sound one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary car across the dump on which the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people living effectively in dilapidated houses on the edge of the dump. It's a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film by Akria Kurasowa was something I wanted to see for a long time. Oddly enough, it was often offered as an abridged version of a three- or four-hour original, as some of the advertising materials had run into errors. I waited for the full version and waited for what Kurasova wanted to show us, only to find out on the last release of Criterion that the 140-minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Sit in the End To see the movie last night, I am mixed about the movie. First and foremost, it is visually linked to every following movie. You can see every second of Kurasowal's six remaining films in this movie, right down to the painted sunsets. It is a striking movie in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to get a movie that he would be happy with (of course there are also failed projects). The film is a visual work of art. (However, be warned that if you watch this on your widescreen TV, this has been shot at 1.33, so it will appear in normal TV viewing.) The rest of the movie is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not quite come together. As separate stories, they all work well, but as a cinematic whole, they do not hang as a single entity. I can not blame Kurasova, because you can not always screw everything up, especially if somebody like Robert Altman, who specializes in movies with several characters of this kind, occasionally bombarded himself. <br /> <br /> This is not the case I do not want to say that there is no reason to watch the movie. As with all Kurasova films, there are always reasons to watch his films, whether they work or not. The first ride on the trolley is one of the best things Kurasova has ever done, and is well worth the rent. It's one of the most magical moments in film history when the car is inspected and taken out. The father and the son who live in the car touch each other (though in the end very sad), and there are other little things that shine (like the cast that's great all along the line) and you should at least treat the movie as something else We are usually associated with samurai films or crime thrillers. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating dropout of a master filmmaker, which in this case means it's better than most other filmmaker hits. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 in total much higher.
