One of the great things about many of the great Chinese movies you can find in the video stores is, if you're lucky, very accurate retelling of the actual, true stories. Farewell, my concubine, the Kaiser and the assassin and this film are perfect examples. The filmmakers take a true story and work hard to create a movie accurately, without affecting the facts for dramatic or commercial reasons - the hallmark of many Hollywood and especially Disney movies. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow The later years of a famous local street artist called the King of Masks for his mastery of the Sichuan Change Art. After losing his only son many years before, he seeks a male heir, who continues his rare and dying art in a society in which women are forbidden such works. Master Wang is sold as a son by a slave trader. Everything is good, as he prepares joyfully to pass on his art. But the son is finally found out as a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional opera style akin to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should carefully study Master Liang's portrayal of a man who plays the female role in Chinese opera. It may help them to understand that the players in these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they do not know their own sexuality.
