Very nice movie. It will stay in your memory. Better than romance billed as flying or war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost faultless. Flying buffs like me will also enjoy this movie when attracted to the planes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun looking at the early Crowe. He is good and radiates charm. His reading of "High Flight" is outstanding. Applause, boom
