Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, maybe Dumbland is not for anyone but Lynch and that makes it weird and a collective caricature. Fierce? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no mind and beat wife and kids for fun. From Mexico I can say, I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth are bleeding, the noise and violence make me scream and put me behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yes baby, get it and learn a lesson: Some people are never thankful for your actions. 3- Ants The more Lynch episode of everything, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
