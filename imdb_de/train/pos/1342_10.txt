An exciting and wonderful look at the films that inspired the outstanding Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easily associated with his work, especially the earlier silent film era. Although I'm a bit long, I enjoy it a lot. I found that this is one of the best documentary films in the movie. Required consideration in admiring Martin Scorsese and his work.
