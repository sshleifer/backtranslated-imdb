The story is about Jet Li, who has to fight his old friends. But there is a problem, the friends are superfighters. The movie is full of blood, great action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course, the film has the typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany "Black Mask" is uncut.
