Overall, I fully agree with the rating of Ebert. In a sense, I feel like I should not even comment because it's so much a vet movie and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a resister). The mistake is that Martha is underdeveloped and does not act consistently. I suspect Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian himself and has spent too little planning time on her character.
