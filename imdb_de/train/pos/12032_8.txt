The film I'm going to discuss is a small television movie from 1996 featuring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels the pressure of such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex-con named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never kiss kisses"), they "fall" at once, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to start their relationship. She manipulates him to kill her parents to protect her "love," but she only uses him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher, future "Sabrina" member for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as a vicious manipulator and she wears the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast works well and everyone has their own if they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this movie was shot and released in the same year, Hart, Sabrina, began to portray the teenage witch, and this shows that she can perform in my genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dated somewhat, it is still considered some of their best work, which includes drama or thriller, and I am looking forward to "Nine Dead", which will be out in November, because it shows that they are can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling". or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina, so you can watch it on the internet, so I suggest.
