Classic, extremely influential low budget thriller that spawned a horror icon and launched the careers of director Carpenter and star Curtis stalking a local babysitter for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that lives up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's terrifying story and clever directing give this movie such a cool life that it has to be seen to really feel it! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets and creaking doors that makes even the everyday life of a small neighborhood really scary. Carpenter has done well with his suspense and jolting thrusts to scare her most effectively, which in itself is a hero few horror movie makers ever manage! He's also smart enough to give us some really likeable young characters and a very frightening villain to keep the tension even stronger. Highest Kudos also enter Carpenter's simple but frighteningly disquieting music score. Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. The young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very nice turn as the lovable babysitter Laurie Strode. She is so good that she would star in some other horror movies before breaking into bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect job as Myers doctor desperately trying to arrest him again. Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. <br /> <br /> Like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that is always exciting and refreshing. It's a MUST for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** from ****
