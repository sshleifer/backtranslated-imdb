Wow, I loved this movie! It's about the normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and dedication. Great! It's about things that everyone in life meets. You have to do things with passion. But some people do not appreciate your passion and try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what the neighbors consider important" more important than following their heart. Do not let another person stop you from fulfilling your dreams and your passion. I loved that the actors were all normal people, it could have been my family. Not big beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
