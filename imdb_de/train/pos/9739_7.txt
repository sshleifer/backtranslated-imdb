I enjoyed watching this movie, mainly because of Simon Pegg, who has quickly become a tight box office comedy movie house. <br /> <br /> He is hired by Big Shot, a New York-based media mogul from New York, as Jeff Bridges, a writer, for one of his celebrity rags. <br /> <br /> After paying his dues, he makes it into the higher ranks of the celebrity writing (the "seventh room"), in which he himself comes to be a little celebrity. The plot is very funny and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as a corrupt advertising agency. <br /> <br /> On the way to success he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <Besides the formal plot, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as a love interest. The rest of the supporting actor has done a good job. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy and well worth a visit to the theaters.
