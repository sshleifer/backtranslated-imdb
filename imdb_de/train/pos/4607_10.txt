My favorite movie by Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this movie from 1985, "Police Story". In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who attacks a notorious criminal and his gang and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can bring the evidence of the state. As the story progresses, the gangster sends his rascals to send Lin, but Chan takes the matter into his own fists and feet while keeping her friend Maggie Cheung in check. Like "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has many of the typical stunts and exuberant martial arts / action choreographies that made Chan famous, culminating in a Battle Royal in a crowded mall. In his role as a director, Chan excels at excellence and gives a charismatic and witty performance that underscores the action. While "Light Story" expresses the entire slapstick humor of "Drunken Master", "Police Story" is basically just a police story, a grim cop-thriller that would be copied many times in the coming years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
