Sure, he soon became uneven after the movie, but from "Knife In The Water" to "The Tenant", you could always count on Roman Polanski to deliver something intriguing and unique. Despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really the same. The story of this is similar to his own "Repulsion" of ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. "The Tenant" manages to make darker than dark absurdity (I relieve some humor, though the bizarre behaviors and dialogue of the protagonists were occasionally funny) with really exciting paranoia. Polanski has always been a master at creating discomfort, and moments in this movie are almost unbearably scary. The general strangeness of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Polanski's exquisite orientation as usual, the rest of the cast and crew provide great contributions. Polanski, the actor, is often overshadowed by Polanski, the director, but his performance here really expresses the awkwardness and the feeling of being an outsider. The issues of social discrimination make this movie more than strangeness to be weird. The rest of the cast also features strong performances, notably the sympathetic turn of Isabelle Adjani and the correspondingly annoying Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. "The Tenant" is often underestimated because people are willing to praise "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby," but it's as brilliant as these two classics. (9/10)
