This TV series was one of the series that I loved as a kid. Although I now see it through the pink glasses of nostalgia, I can still say that it was a quality show, very educational, but still funny. I have not seen the French original version, only the Swedish one. I have no idea how good the synchronization was, it was too long ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has still not taught me half of what I know from this show. It is also related to other things, such as what happens when you eat unhealthy food and do not move, with beautiful examples in the body. Who would like to have another bar of chocolate, if you know that miniature visors can invade you? : D The cartoon looked nice, very kid friendly, but with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon characters and look pretty much as you would expect them to look like in the animated body. The series on the story (especially the ecological horror finale) was a important part of my childhood. I am so happy that I found her here.
