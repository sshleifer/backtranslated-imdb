AFTER DARK is the first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the others are the more well-known GRIFTERS). AFTER DARK has all the features of Thompson: dangerous women, self-confidence, and characters that are either not as weak as others suspect or harmless. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is outstanding as a former boxer, who was ruled out of life due to an event in the Ring (director James Foley uses sequences from RAGING BULL sequences to improve the situation backstory) and the under-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his gracious gamer Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is virtually no comic relief in this film. So look at yourself being sucked into the void.
