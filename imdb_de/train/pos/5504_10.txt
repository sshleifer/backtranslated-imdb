I just saw it last night and it aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Passionate Eye series. It was recently shown (Sept. 2003) as well as many others at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a pretty remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally stumbled into history and were there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they were in the thick of the action when the coup took place. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and made the story largely unfold. They have, of course, their own ideological perspective (which they make public), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history that led to the coup. As a film, it's not groundbreaking in the stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think that's the way it should be. What we will see what "embedded" journalism really should be. What we see is a remarkable account of a country fighting for democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares about his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military interests / Combine media to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
