This German documentary is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art out of objects that he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film, we see how he cuts icicles and "sticks" them with some moisture into a serpentine shape that repeatedly appears to go through a vertical rock. Of course icicles are melting, but this transience is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a website and gets a feel for what he should do that day. He speaks of a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with and tries to work * with * instead of them. It could be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture can take minutes or years, or not long enough to be finished and photographed. The work seems to be more of a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The movie and the work are beautiful, inspiring and thought provoking. It moves quite slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should be safe if you have slept well. But go, if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the Internet for other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his sculptures at Stanford University. There are also several books with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: Read this section if you want to find out what makes this film completely independent for you. I remember a few ideas that came to my mind when watching the movie that I thought I would share with those of you who are still reading. First, the ephemeral nature of many of Andy Goldsworthy's works reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live and finally we die. That's natural, and of course that's part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The other idea was to marvel at how Goldsworthy has succeeded in integrating his passion and work so thoroughly into his life. Most of us have work that is tolerated at best, a life we ​​barely notice, and passions that we really want to spend more time remembering for what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create a blend of all those aspects of his life that looks like it works very well and nourishes for him and the people around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen on 28.08.2002.
