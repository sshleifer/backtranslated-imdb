One year after the beautiful Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) was lost to rival Tarzan, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to once again look after the heart of the brunette baby. He mixes business and pleasure and plans to grab some ivory from the Elephant Cemetery, which is beyond the Mutia slope, Tarzan's Tamping Area. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his slimy, cheerful buddy Martin Arlington and a group of consumables, Harry finally achieves his goal (he barely avoided death by wild natives and monkeys with monkey dangers), only to find that Jane still in love with her muscle-bound yodel, and worse, Tarzan will not let the hunters pick ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington decides to solve the matter by ambushing the ape man and then tells Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is not dead, only wounded. After being well looked after by Cheetah (!), He can take action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion-devouring savages who attacked Holt's expedition. Tarzan And His Mate, the second film in which Weism√ºller plays the jungle man of few words, is often referred to by fans as the best of the series; Although I prefer the original a bit, I can definitely understand the popularity of the movie: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes. Since both stars are wearing inimitable outfits, there is plenty of eye candy for underwater nude people (despite the beloved O'Sullivan), who are actually running a body-double, the beautiful girl still shows plenty of skin and even threatens to make a "Sharon Stone" in one place while her loincloth works to one side!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting moments of the film come from a wonderful fight between Tarzan and a crocodile and the spectacular finale, in which Jane is attacked by lions and natives. She is, however, rescued by her friend, his ape colleague and a lot of elephants in the mode of the lion's groaning (once again, the violence is surprisingly uncomfortable, although for me nothing is as shocking as the evil pygmies and their gorilla from the first movie). Cheetah also has some excitement in avoiding rhinos, crocodiles and big cats, riding on Tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and even jumps on a bunch to ride with him. <br /> <br /> Like its predecessor, Tarzan And His Mate easily suffers from some bad effects and unconvincing props, hazy back projection, a few ridiculous clothes, other Indian elephants masquerading as African cousins, and bad camouflaged trapeze swings, but this should not spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining movie. If anything, make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
