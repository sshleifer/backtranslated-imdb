This was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last, and he died nine days after shooting on Cancer. All this makes his key scene in the film all the more moving. <br /> <br /> Although some hairstyles and clothing styles are a bit dated (note the video game shown in the movie), the theme of the movie is quite timeless. Heston said that he wanted to do the film for a long time, because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. Some things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The acting is first class, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with nice performances also by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The medley by Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky in connection with the pastoral visual elements gives some really moving scenes. This was the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of the movie is a major topic. Yes, it's a movie about overpopulation, but more importantly, it's a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with humanity's leadership of Earth. In the subtext you will find the actual message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old times" of the past (which is our present), and note that Thorn is unable to understand what Sol is saying. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my best sci-fi movies of all time.
