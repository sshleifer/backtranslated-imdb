Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is tormented by a mystery and seeks salvation by radically changing the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is fixed, nothing can stop him. At least he thinks. But Ben did not mean to fall in love with any of these people, and she'll turn him in the end. After the life-inspiring film "The Pursuit of Happiness," Will Smith returns to director Gabriele Muccino. "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing movie experience that not only reminds you of your previous collaboration, but also full of tears, but it will inspire you in the end. Will Smith is also producer for some others. These films are very realistic, showing the life of an ordinary man and his struggles in life. Seven pounds might have taken some time to get their real swing, but shortly after half an hour of the movie, the movie is set to rule your heart. Also in this film, there are some twists, which allow the viewer to guess further. Director Gabriele Muccino is again the winner with his emotional and inspirational message. He makes all characters of the movie very real, so that people would find themselves somewhere in the movie. In addition to the director, Will Smith is another winner with his outstanding acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and actor acts as a spell. There are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with intelligence, that's the way you call it. She looks beautiful and does her part extremely well. Barry Pepper gives the film great support and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody did not have much time for the timing (would have been good if he had more). You will not forget this movie so easily. Watch this movie and change your life. First class cinema!
