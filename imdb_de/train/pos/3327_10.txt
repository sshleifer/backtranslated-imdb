I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How come I saw this great movie just three years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart. Big time. It's hard to describe in my lazy English - but I have to try it anyway: <br /> <br /> The cast is consistently excellent - from the lead role to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogue is great and the Film is perfectly directed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think the Farrelly brothers' films are often underestimated - they're not easy comedies - they're deeeeeep! They talk about what life is about (I'm not telling you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie confirmed the relationship: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: Let them be free, let them be - try, the passion and the Sharing pain, and always remaining faithful. <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports hater, but definitely an athlete. But in this movie - the mood brings you. I could smell the atmosphere of baseball. Finally, this movie told me what it means for you to be a sports fan, and what cool fan families need to be out there. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it yet, have a look at KINGPIN!
