It has been so many years since I saw this, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel against those who beat it up. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. That's what I think is humor. It is subjective. It will either be charged by your funny bone at 60,000 volts or you'll be cold and wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show has put some of the UK's best comic actors in a silly story disrespectful and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and picture comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads (Cleese and Lowe) are outstanding. This was done for her. <br /> <br /> I can not really say more than to ask you to find this and look at it. You will not be disappointed and in a world without exemplary humor this is a classic, insane and harmless piece of comic brilliance.
