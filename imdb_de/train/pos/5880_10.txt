In contrast to the person mentioned above, I had the feeling that this movie was very funny, especially in the scenes where there is a lot of confusion. I do not want to pass on the plot and the plot to the people who have not yet seen it, but I want to say that Paresh Rawal does not play a major role, as in previous Priyadarshan films, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an amazing role in this small role, John Abraham is just as good. Akshay Kumar has proved that he is no less in this film as he had from Waqt and almost all of his films to Andaaz. Although all three heroines made a debut in this movie, they did a very good job, especially Nargis, who looks and feels very good. I would say if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is a must.
