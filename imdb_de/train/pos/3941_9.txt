The young Mr. Lincoln is the first film of the director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember Fonda telling years ago that, as a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln, and was afraid that he would not face the challenge. John Ford, before shooting starts to reassure him. He said he would not play the Great Emancipator, just a prairie lawyer. Fonda led a cast that had referred John Ford into a classic movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical film about Lincoln. That had happened in the sound era with Walter Huston, and a year after Young Lincoln, Raymond Massey made the Pulitzer Prize winner piece by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey remains the final Lincoln. But, as Ford said, Fonda did not play the Great Emancipator, just a lawyer from a small town in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of his early life. We see him employed in a retail store and got some law books from a pioneer immigrant family whose way he would later find in history. And his romance with Ann Rutledge and her early death make Lincoln a very melancholy creature. <br /> <br /> Fast forward by 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer starting to get publicity. He has completed some terms of office in the legislature, but he is back in private practice and does not know exactly if politics is for him. <br /> <br /> Here is the main part of the action. The two sons of this family had been given the law books long ago when they were charged with murder. He offers to defend her. And not an ordinary murder, but a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial itself is a fiction, but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the two sons, is based on a genuine case that Lincoln had defended. I do not say anymore. <br /> <br /> Apart from the performances, the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere of a small prairie town in Illinois in the fourth quarter of the US July Celebration It It's almost as if you were watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, alive and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford movies will recognize two musical themes that have been repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, the background music is the same theme that shot in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the tune Lovely Susan Brown, the Fonda, and Marjorie Weaver playing Mary Todd, the same thing Fonda danced with Cathy Downs, is in My Darling Clementine's dance for the rearing of a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I believe. The first is that he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology, in which people rise from their own efforts to the pinnacle of power. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln vividly shows the background from which Lincoln came. And second, the fact that he was our president during the biggest crisis in American history, and that he made the only good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some political reasons. His assassination secured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others, whom I mentioned as a special praise, Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two city birds, Kohler as the murder victim and Binde the prosecutor. Even Donald Meek as prosecutor and Alice Brady in their last movie as pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters, who specializes in rustic characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures the drama and romance of its time, you can do no better than Young Mr Lincoln.
