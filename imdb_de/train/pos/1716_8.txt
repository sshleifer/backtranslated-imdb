Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and welcomes her "hello sister" !!! This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl, ran away from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not appear alone in the big, evil world. , Abhay, the next-door guy, turns to the vulnerable Soha and helps her find a job in a retirement home. Slowly the romance is blooming and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly filmed in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well-made film has moments that will be remembered forever? the awkward first kiss and Abhays quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class wali ladki" and hastily adds "that he does not love her"; He gave Soha a churidar and asked her for a date. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene where Soha Abhay storms and hugs, the soundtrack disappears. The silence conveys both the awkwardness and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The poignant ending makes for a bittersweet movie whose memories will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> A must I will rate it 8.5 / 10
