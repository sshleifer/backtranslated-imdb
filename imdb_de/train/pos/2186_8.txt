and what a combo. Two of the great singers of the century are playing together in this underrated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and both work for Basil Rathbone, who also can not write because his wife has died (actually, she's just getting fat!). The best scene is the pawnshop number, where Bing sings an improvised number, while the swing band gets their instruments out of the springboard. Just wonderful. And this is a rare lead role for Broadway legend Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram co-star. And who knew that Rathbone could be funny?
