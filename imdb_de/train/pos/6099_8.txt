I still have gritty, late, wireless, cheap VHS dub's of this show from waaaaaaayyyy, as late-night commercials and all, if I stayed up to the weird hour in which they were going to hit that show - just so I could record it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really ABOUT Freddy Kreuger - only the first few episodes had actually called him something else than a Rod Serling demanded announcer. Instead, each episode was a definite nightmare, using the traditional horror themes: horrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From the episode where a teenager accidentally tells the wrong girl "I'll love you forever" and stays with her (literally, at least for a moment, when they grow together ...) the one in which a young stewardess goes home with a stranger, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room with other stewardesses, and one I vaguely remember playing blind dates with hockey ( and the associated injuries and penalties) - dating was definitely the scariest in the series. <br /> <br /> An episode had Jeffrey Combs (re-animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza dealer with a delicious new secret ingredient. Not original, but still scary and funny .... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, some of the episodes were great. My personal favorite was "It's a miserable life," in which a young man works in his parents' burger joint when he wants to go to college. Stuck in conversation with himself and small puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until a late night, when a funny guy comes through the passage and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a gun with a gun - turns out that the whole startling episode is just that - the last thoughts that go through the child's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of the Freddie's Nightmares episodes were essentially two vague contiguous short stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded but not killed while driving by and who entered the "hospital from hell "was brought. - You cram yourself into all the scariest hospital nightmare stereotypes, and then some - from accidentally closing your mouth - or waking up during an operation - to your dead friend who wants to lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle /> <br / > That was my favorite again. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were a lot more stupid, as almost all of them have made available on VIDEO. They put out the lumps as representatives of the series, and nobody likes them, thinks the show stinks, and they stop making videos. It's a miserable life, available in England only on PAL DVD - but I'll still buy it.
