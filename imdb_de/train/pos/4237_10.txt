Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus one, but Mark Wahlberg decided not to wear the traditional loincloth. I hope nobody throws him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first two Planet movies, but Estrella Warren barely shows a cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have brought this Simian saga to sex and give the adults in the audience something to see. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her costume, which looks like a big curtain. She is cute, but all the love stuff is limited to fearful looks and a small snappy kiss in the end. As in Artificial Intelligence, which discusses gender between species and species between robots and humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes suggests an inter-species romance between humans and monkeys, but only clues. Lisa Marie is the only ape who dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors, Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti, who chew the scenery as a trio of monkeys and it's fun to see them. Superlative make-up (a certain Oscar), costumes, sets and music make this summer the hit of the summer movie of 2001.
