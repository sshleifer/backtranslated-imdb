"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was everything the previews showed. It's not often that you find that. Mostly the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this. I was satisfied with the original plot, even if the subplots were not. The animation was not like "Shrek", but it was still good. The plot and plot were well presented and there were only a few slow spots. That keeps you interested. I enjoyed to enjoy this. "Atlantis" keeps and keeps your attention. You also have to think a bit, but not too much. If you think about it for a while, you can figure out what needs to happen, but you really do not know exactly how it will happen. <br /> <br /> The casting was good too. Michael J. Fox was an excellent choice as Milo. His personality goes well together. The grumpy Commander Rourke was also selected with James Garner. His character reminded me of his appearance in "Maverick", which I liked too. I really liked the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a straightforward personality makes the movie more interesting. It's just too bad that she's a rogue. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth it (8 out of 10).
