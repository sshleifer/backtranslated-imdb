This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was 'enchanted' and should be surprised because it was so unique. The cast, the sequencing, the effects ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made the rest outstanding was that it was told in a fun and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me it is the representation of a modern fairy tale. It's just like the modern Peter Pan ... just fantastic. <br /> <br /> I would certainly buy a copy of it as soon as it goes on the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double MUST SEE ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
