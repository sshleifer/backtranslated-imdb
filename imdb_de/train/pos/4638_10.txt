I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. My Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at any point in the movie. They tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! It represents two of the most famous taboos in the Middle East: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both areas of the conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions. The film reaches its climax in the tragedy when anger and anger drive one of the lovers onto an extremist side! an absolute must see !!
