Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary about rookie firefighters in New York City. What they got was the only footage in the World Trade Center on September 11th. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's leader company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gédéon stayed in the fire station if anything interesting happened. An airplane flying low over the city distracted Jules and pointed the camera up before the plane crashed into Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he did not want to film. He stayed for a few hours, filming reactions from firefighters and other people present. The Naudet brothers were careful not to make the movie too violent, grizzly, and bloody. But the language of the firefighters is a little rough, and CBS showed a lot of balls that air uncensored. The Naudet brothers mixed footage they had filmed with individual interviews so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and feelings at certain moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a movie with a similar title, most of the money is spent on DVD sales to charities related to 9/11 funds. Very well done, emotional, moving and completely free of political propaganda, is the best documentary of its kind so far.
