In a series full of brilliant episodes, this one is one of my favorites. It is not the most profound episode, there is no meaning or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some good performances. <br /> <br /> But what really sets it apart is that to my knowledge it ends the * only * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper. The Zone is rightly known for its big surprise at the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise, and you think that's it, but it turns out there's another surprise waiting for you. I just like it so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other one is deeper, more message-oriented).
