Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, similar to the dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, the A-Team, etc. etc. The show is just a clean TV. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing. They often take jabs several times in a row, which adds humor to the show. It contains several chases in almost every episode, but who has no good chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just wish they had clean TV today. I highly recommend this!
