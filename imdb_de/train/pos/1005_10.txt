Verhoeven's film was totally garbage. He is a disgusting hacker of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read two chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do it from scratch. Heinlein would NEVER have supported this garbage if it had been alive. It essentially steals the name, mocks the book's politics (which is a good part of it), and throws in a few T & A actions so that the average American idiot does not get bored. This anime is not perfect, but at least it's mostly accurate as best I can tell.
