The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. There are no nice pictures shown. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various settings. It's easy to try, but difficult to achieve. The film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less committed audience to experience what happened. Instead, the film touches and moves through different genres. The trick to love the movie is to be able to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect 99% of North American viewers will simply not get it. If you try to pin down the narrative of this movie or the philosophical message or the symbolist structure, etc., you will lose time. There is nothing like it. The film is only temporarily focused on these and other genres. The only connecting force in the film is the feeling of Claire Denis, which fits together. There are so few feature films that can almost satisfy Kant's description of what art is, namely, the exercise of judgment itself rather than simply subsuming experience into terms. The film usually makes the easy way and chooses the easier pleasure of understanding what's going on. Most of the film is not art. Most films do not come close to art. If a movie is like this movie and still enjoyed by many viewers, that's a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find the film too simplistic when I look at the various narrative threads that run through it. The Tahitian father-son narrative, though not exactly conventional, makes things a bit too clear and simple. It dominates too much.
