We could still use Black Adder today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson plays the role of assistant to the Prime Minister, played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is as sensational as the fool Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode that features Kenneth Connor as a British thespian. Every time Edmund Macbeth says. The two Thespian disciples do a stupid little act to fend off evil spirits. It's the funniest things you'll see. Of course, none of this brilliant and comedic talent can be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind the films like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be intelligent, sexy and funny at the same time. I had hoped for a live evening on Saturday night, Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his British humor. If the gang researched SNL they would know what a treasure it would be if Hugh Laurie were on stage.
