I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could tell something. This is a movie I would show my children to let them know. The feelings they have are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so disfigured by things at such a young age ... who knew that we would always come back again .... over and over again .... Great movie !!!!
