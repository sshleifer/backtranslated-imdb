OK, so I do. I rate movies on 10 components. Each component naturally begins with 5 points. It can then lose or win 5 points for possible 10 or 0 points. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was funny and exciting. The romance was not exaggerated, but still very emotional and moving. I have laughed hard and long throughout the movie, yet I was fascinated by the fantastic drama and the thrill. <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought that all good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself in the theater, returned to my childhood and at that moment I believed again in unicorns, wicked witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the film captured the story very well in most points of view, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what was happening right in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that she C.G.I. economical. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were terrifyingly realistic. All in all, less is more and this had EVERYTHING! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and experienced actors, the cast was incredible! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully angry, Charlie Cox brought Tristan to life, Claire Danes gave emotions to the stars, and I'll never look the same again to Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors have played their roles perfectly. I will never look the same again to Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a bit rushed and I think if the movie had been a little longer, they could have done the characters a little better. The dialogue was smart, funny, funny? Even the porridge had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Rating - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly only remember a small piece of music from the entire film. I do not complain beyond that the music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the end should be more pronounced, while others might have been more subdued, but no strings were removed. HEL YEAH! Do you see it in the theater? Certainly! Conclusion: Excellent movie for everyone! EPOS! I strongly recommend to see it in the theater. I know, I'm going back for seconds!
