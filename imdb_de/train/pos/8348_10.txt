By 1986, I happened to see this movie on television one night. I was 6 years old. It was like my accidental consideration of the terrible end of Do not Look Now in 1987. The next year I drove in silent terror to Venice, hoping that my parents would not find out I had seen it. <br /> <br /> Would I have objected if my parents had known that I had seen Les Valseuses when I was a child? I probably would avoid the topic with my father today as well, and my mother is probably disapproving in the afterlife. I do not know if they want to see it anyway. I'm never sure if this movie is a rash piece of garbage that disregards the sexual revolution, or if it's a rash piece of garbage, the stalking and falling of a woman on the block of flats in the first scene to the slipping down of mountain roads with glazed eyes sexy liberating movie to look at, as you realize that you yourself could never be so insulting. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. It has a violent view of sex, virtually no recognition of love. Even the infant of an infant mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. But the scenario is very erotic and (God, I'm so British) exciting! Do you suck your breasts for the best? That's exploitation. Why am I getting a woody? <br /> <br /> The boys are looking for an experienced elderly woman, looking for an ex-swindler, a mother figure? I dont know. It ends in a really cruel suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust guts, and he went eeuurrgghh! No maternal love for this film, on the contrary. Mutilation where the boys started. Why are you shooting the girl in the leg? Why is she coming back to you? Do women have to be punished so that they learn what is right for men? <br /> <br /> I think of two films, one of which wished I had never seen, the other makes me wish it was not such a hard world. Swept Away / Madonna, which is not charged for a bunch of madness, has never been so offended that a woman who is punished for being a woman becomes a man's slave and perhaps she says that every lady respects her Ritchie is in a fit of rage. Once upon a time in America / Leone God, why do noodles do that? Destroy the path to joy that we have followed in his entire life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now both are destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but lots of sex and nudity galore, both sexes. Very honest, no tickling. No fantasy shags, no perfect Hollywood smooth moves. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness and jealousy and trickery to call it a sex comedy. Do not forget to shoot a bare barber in the leg because she will come back and you will bring her together with the son of her ex-con lover & she will learn how she injects from him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, nobody will want to see it now! It's a brilliant movie!
