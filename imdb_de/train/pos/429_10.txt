It's been around 50 years since a film about romance and mysticism was filmed. The only two films I can think of are Enchanted April (1992) and The Enchanted Cottage (1945). Both films used wonderful actors, not stars. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after the First World War who are dissatisfied with their lives and happy on holiday in Italy. It's amazing that "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It is a pleasing classic.
