After reading some comments, I felt that I had to add my two cents as well. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I had the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I found this movie incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short time. The story focuses on a young girl who falls prey to her abusive father. She soon has a choice to stop him from a demon played by Eric Etebari of Witchblade. After watching the show, I was impressed by how he played such a unique character. I never knew he could behave so well! His character was very complex and he was very convincing. The play was absolutely great. The girl was fine and the father's was decent. Therein is the death that follows the girl until she can escape her future. The effects and the cinematography were absolutely stunning. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for it. It rarely happens that you see such a high quality shorts. The opening was absolutely breathtaking, comparable to all the major feature films. That's not to say it's not without mistakes - I thought it took a while to get started and the intro was a bit long. But that stuck in my head days after seeing it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality.
