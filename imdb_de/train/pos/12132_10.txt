Despite Leslie Howard's performance pleasant. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. One should have pity for this man; But I have to cheer for Bette Davis' Mildred. Ms. Davis is one of her best performers (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she brings this rather boring movie to life. ** Do not miss that Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him.
