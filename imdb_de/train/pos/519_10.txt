I saw this movie for the first time about 20 years ago and never forgot it. It's beautifully filmed and the story remains intrigued the whole time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, as the story is still fresh today and really thought-provoking. I'm not very knowledgeable about movie techniques, but the special effects in this movie are great, considering when it was made. In addition, the spectacle is outstanding and the use of English and American actors is amazing. I recently bought the DVD and can now watch it anytime. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in British postwar films.
