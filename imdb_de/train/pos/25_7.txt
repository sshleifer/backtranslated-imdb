I've never seen this when I was a kid, so this was seen with fresh eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it for my five year old daughter. The idea that Christopher Walken sings and dances made me curious. The special effects are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was excited. I loved watching Walken in that role and thinking about what the future holds for him. Very funny to see him dance! And if the songs were not great, at least they were not overproduced sweeties from Disney. The ogre scene at the beginning was a bit scary for her, and when we finally saw him again, she was a bit nervous, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly enough, we had recently read "The Puss in Boots" and wondered about the implausibility of the story. Walken's acting, while true to almost every aspect, made it believable. Have fun. I would take another look at it with my daughter.
