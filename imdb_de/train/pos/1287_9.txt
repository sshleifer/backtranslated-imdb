"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the Twin Cities. It came late at night, something that would make you stumble upon your 7th bottle of Hamm while surfing the canal. <br /> <br /> Even the ads were produced locally, with Wally in front of Grumpy's Bar, a microphone in hand and stammering nervously - "Ahh ... to you, Steve Sedahl." Not sure why, but that always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition in which a dispute was settled between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the comments and clips. Sedahl played it straight out, in return for Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and witty "Wally Hotvedt". Highlights included segments like "How to properly dispose of an old bowling ball" (she's in a lake) and "Dating Tips", where the duo dates "a few whores" and Wally ends up with the bitter complaint, "I could have do it yourself! "<br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did on their days off - Steve showed in a beer can, which was squeezed out of the fridge while Wally struggled to reach the cliffs of Taylor's Falls Climb Light blue blazer and oversized headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally's awesome comments on "League Bowlers" and his effort to apply the right euphemism to different divisions were also highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments, but the network never really knew what to do in primetime and bowling "competition" emphasize what was never the purpose of the show. The constant advertisements interrupted the river and the minor characters (Ernie, the pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and somehow forced to be. Even Jon Stewart dropped off with Let's Bowl on the Daily Show - (not enough lame, jokes?) - a horrible treatment for a show that deserves a lot better. <br /> <br /> How often does a "Let's Bowl" get you into the world of modern television, a mix of comedic genius and dead crap? In the networks, the "total crap" part is cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill a dark, weird, funny little gem like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Let's hope they will release it on DVD.
