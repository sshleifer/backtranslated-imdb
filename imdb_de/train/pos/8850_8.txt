Legendary director Sidney Lumet shows us one of his best films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that is dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-List cast, led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet not only has elements of failed detective stories like Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories like Ordinary People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers might be confused and feel under-challenged in building the plot Lumet took. Instead of linearizing it, he took the Tarantino route and showed the central scene of a robbery that went awry from different angles. Personally, I found that to be very satisfying, and constantly asked myself what would happen next. The script is very strong with some outstanding scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei and between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally committed, and obviously Lumet enjoys directing a style he does not normally dive into. Lots of action and excitement to keep the audience for the two hour run, this is a rare movie that does not work. It disappoints for a moment.
