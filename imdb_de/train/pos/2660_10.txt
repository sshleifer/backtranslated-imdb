When I saw The Shining for the first time, I expected a decent movie of what I had heard about it, and I liked a lot of other work by Stanley Kubrick, but when I started watching the movie, he was so much better than me thought. Sometimes I felt seriously uncomfortable and I could not take my eyes off the screen, even though everything in the movie is very disturbing. Well, some people do not like Kubrick's version of The Shining because it does not fully follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion, both Kubrick's version, the miniseries and the book are great. Jack Nicholson is a great performer Look for a good original movie that will make you think after the movie ends, then check out The Shining.
