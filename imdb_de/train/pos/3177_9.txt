Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing that I did not like about this movie. Cross Eyed was shot beautifully. Adam does a great job of developing not just the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives every low-budget movie hope. That you do not have to spend much to create something that's worth seeing. There is something for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. If you've ever picked a dork in high school. if you have ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have any sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the kind of movie that is on the market for a long time and reappears as soon as Adam makes a bigger name. I'm looking forward to Adam's future projects.
