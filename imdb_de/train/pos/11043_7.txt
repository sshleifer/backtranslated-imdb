Malefique has pretty much the viewer from start to finish with its nervous atmosphere. Almost the entire movie takes place in a prison cell that revolves around 4 characters, of which the transvestite Marcus and his little backward boy are the strangest. Soon the inmates find behind a brick a diary of a former inmate dealing with his obsession with occult and black magical issues leading to his escape from the cell. From here on, it's about uncovering the secret of the book and its curses from the prison. This leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I find the story rather bad and the last twist is nice, but for me the ends are pretty loosely connected. Anyway, I was thrilled to the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal cast and cast. The kills are rough and scary ... it does not take a lot of thrills to cool the spine, and the occult themes are also very well done, reminding me of the hellish themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold, dirty feel with greenish tones. Sometimes one wonders if the real or the occult world depicted here is more alien ... if the backward boy loses his fingers and goes to sleep and sucks Marcus' breasts, it seems normal how weird can glowing Goals to freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a very different way than most genre shockers. I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale. Some elements such as the visitor with the camera, the other inmates are obsessed with books and the toy doll, which vaguely points to the end, do not fit into the story. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open to other films by director Valette, though it's a departure to see him make a Hollywood remake of "One missed call", which was already worn out and useless in the Miike version.
