Even though he is over 70 years old, this movie is still a very moving, strong movie. Bette Davis, as the nasty, vicious cockney waitress Mildred, is absolutely believable. Seeing your performance is still fascinating. It makes the observer absolutely despise and at the same time feel sorry for her. Leslie Howard's performance as a weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not that strong, but I do not see how an actor could defend herself against Ms. Davis's performance. She chews the landscape in every scene she's in and steals the show. This is the movie that made her famous and she won the Oscar but lost. It was shocking for the day on which issues like pregnancy without pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and Mildred's vicious language are a bit dated, but still a great movie. Just to see the scene in which Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him ("You Dude, You Dirty Pig ...") is still one of the best acts I've ever seen in the movie.
