Well, again it's a movie that plays with your feelings and you feel very soft, as opposed to a rocking movie. But I'm an idiot for that, so I gave a good score ... The acting was very good and there was a lot of feeling. The violence is reduced to a minimum, which causes a change. I would have given him a 9, if not the greeting in the end would be! All in all a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
