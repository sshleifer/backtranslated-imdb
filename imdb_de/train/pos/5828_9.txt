Micro Phonies is a classic Stooge Short. The boys are unsuitable craftsmen working on a radio station, and during a round in a broadcasting booth, Curly's perfect image of a recording of "Voices of Spring" is confused with reality, resulting in a radio contract and a crazy musical party. Particularly entertaining is the replica of the trio of the quintet of "Lucia de L'Amamore". Undoubtedly, this is indispensable for fans of Stooge. <br /> <br /> Although Curly's health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing and it's probably the last glimpse of the old Curly. Some fans think that "A Bird in the Hand" is the last big Curly short, but his rough voice and his slow movements are just too difficult to watch.
