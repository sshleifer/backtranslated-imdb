It's NEVER a good idea to make a book into a movie by following the story page by page. When people read the book, they automatically start creating their own "mental movie," what the characters look like, where they are, and how the situation develops. And each person's focus is different, so when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out, there's always a clicked part of the movie audience that's disappointed they just do not measure up. <br /> <br /> Everything What a screenwriter and director can expect is whatever his own vision of the film is, and he hopes to get as close to what the audience expects. <br /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than films based on the novels of Stephen King. If filmmakers at least capture the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly scary (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE) or they can be what fans think is a terrible mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING (the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although it's not nearly the perfect adaptation to the king, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of skin and bones that seem to have bled directly from the book to the screen You can forgive the shortcomings pretty well, thanks to music video director Mary Lambert (she has also directed SIESTA, not just a horror movie, but another weird one, as you should see on your list) by one Screenplay of the 'Man-ster' himself and probably one of his better ones. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I will not treat you with too many details in the Sch bring laf. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has relocated his family to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of highway in front of the house and the big animal cemetery in the forest beyond. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son ... Well, even if you have not read the book, do the frickin 'math. It's after all a king's tale, so it's no mystery where this leads. <br /> <br /> The goal is not so important here, but the haunting keeps on the way. Certain scenes so well-known in the book are brought here to a trembling, screaming life: Rachel Creeds (Denise Crosby of STAR TREK) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; Louis' encounters with the fatally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) before and after his death; the journey to the "other" cemetery behind the animal cemetery. And this third act ... if you do not have some nightmares, maybe you should check your heart rate. <br /> <br /> Good performance from everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as a well-meaning neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that puts it all to the point: "Sometimes dead is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis' son Gage (Miko Hughes), knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the performance of a child of that age to deal with it Lambert and his crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes was just too damned at the time. CUTE "sells" his intended role as a nasty, demon-possessed zombie. This will lead you out of the movie whenever he appears, though the scenes in which he is seen are still masterfully staged (especially Gwynne's death scene). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything else is as good as it gets. CARRIE is still the title for the best adaptation to the king, as far as I am concerned; But SEMATARY is at the top of the top five. <br /> <br /> Will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as scary as reading the story? Not BLOODY probably ... for now.
