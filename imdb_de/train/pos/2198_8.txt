The third film by Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It is another adaptation of the play Burlesque, which was apparently popular. <br /> <br /> The original piece Burlesque ran for 372 shows on Broadway during the 1927-1928 season, and this is the role that Carole Lombard plays Barbara Stanwyck was formed on Broadway, which brought her to Hollywood. One version featured Nancy Carroll in the early days of Talkies, and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey built yet another version of When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album from a Radio version made by Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler for the Lux Radio Theater. That's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard are doing well with the old fox, the story is now playing in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray a jazz trumpeter. Notice a beautiful performance of Dorothy Lamour as a Latin vixen who comes between Fred and Carole. Even Anthony Quinn is in one of his first films as Wolf on the brand for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low is doing really well today and I would not be surprised if we had another version of Burlesque for the twenty-first century.
