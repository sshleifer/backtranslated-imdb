The 12th Disney animated classic is a sensible film told through a simple story. Although a bit dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It's not one of Disney's top works, but it's satisfying. One of Disney's "simplest" works, yes, but retains some magic and enchantment (for which the old Disney is known). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a difficult situation. If this were a failure, there are no more animated Disney classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somehow a return to Disney's 1st animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarves") because it returns the fairytale genre. It's not clear where the story is going, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because it's based on a story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many sympathetic characters like Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the fairy fairy (for a fairy she is certainly funny), the birds , the king and the Grand Duke. Jaques is very smart and amusing. I like his voice. Really has this mouse-like quality. Gus may not be so smart, but he is humorous. The king is funny, but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temperament. The Grand Duke is a very cool guy and funny. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and responsible for many of the funniest moments. The prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip was inspired by "Sleeping Beauty" by this prince because they look very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) is not to be sympathetic because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. The stepmother, however, is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and adorable. By the way, I think that her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than that of Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is weirdly vicious. The way he walks, his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish expressions make him weird. Ironically, he is very similar to the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. Nevertheless, nothing bothers him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but enjoyable, even though it's not one of Disney's best. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many well-known, talented speakers, including James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <br /> <br /> Although the film looks simple, it has good artwork as well as beautiful details, although he is never something "out of the world". The Royal Palace, however, is a spectacular masterpiece, truly majestic and colossal.
