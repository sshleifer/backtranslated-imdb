Pierce Brosnan, the latest but not James Bond anymore, is an assassin. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is very good as a pure and thin businessman. Well, when the story starts, the movie shows these two people in their own lives. Then one evening they drink drinks in a bar and start talking. Suddenly you meet these two people who contract during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is first class and the humor is funny. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but he is real and I have to say that this movie is a must.
