This is the cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin. Optically well done and much more entertaining and memorable. Worth seeing only for the music alone! While there are elements that undoubtedly affect the sensibility of some of these days, the caricature needs to be given a bit of perspective. It's over sixty years old and it's just a cartoon after all. I am handicapped, and if I were as hypersensitive as the people who look at and embrace things like that cartoon, I would have been curled up in a fetal position and gone. Sometimes you have to lighten up, put your head back and float! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and almost never flattered. Bing Crosby supposedly hated it when used more than once. *SIGH*
