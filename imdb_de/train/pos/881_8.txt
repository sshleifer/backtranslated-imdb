"Read My Lips" tells of a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple, maladroit office worker (Devos) and her intern at work, a brutal excon (Casel). As the film unfolds this unlikely duo to its ids, it engulfs itself in a refreshing mix of minds, each using the other for its own selfish reasons, with an extraordinary result. Good things for all who make character films with strong psychodramatic currents. French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
