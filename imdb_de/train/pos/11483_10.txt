The thing that makes this movie so scary is the way he portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal guys. These are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers, fooling around in front of the camera, forgetting lines of script, etc. They just make the video as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives have been. Your parents just think the guys are shooting for a family video. By examining other children's attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what they should not do and inform them (usually in a silly way, "This Old House") about possible "Andres and Calvins" who might watch this video Bombs, weapons received and not caught before Zero Day (the day of the attack).
