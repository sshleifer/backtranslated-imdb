I have to say that the events of 9/11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to deal with the devastation. I was the one who changed the station on the radio and the station on TV when talking about the towers. I was tired of hearing about it. When this was televised a year and a day later, I yelled out my eyes. It was the first time I had cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentation. I see it on TV now, 5 years later, and I still cry because of the tragedies. The fact that this is one of the few video footage of the first aircraft that hits the tower is amazing. It was a coincidence and see where they came from. These two brothers make me to have been there to help.
