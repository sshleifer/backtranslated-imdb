I had seen this movie when it was released and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly remember the wonderful scenes in which the hero / heroine escapes each time he faces danger the rogue! I think many so-called action movies have copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And it not only impresses me when I see such a copy, it also increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors did a wonderful job. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry before the hero and the heroine was extremely natural and wonderful. As children, we felt that the love that developed out of them was very natural. :) The way they handle all difficulties and difficulties together is something that can lead to children recognizing the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend everyone to watch this movie if he has a chance !! --Vijay.
