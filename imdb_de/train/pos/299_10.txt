Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really great movies, and THEY ALL LAUGH is one of his best. The cast could not be better for this light but bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly, Bogdonavich, with his witty, light touch, gives the film a disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediately the movie starts with no explanation. There is no soundtrack music that appeals to us. We meet the characters in action and as Bogdonavich glides through the streets of New York, the movie unfolds effortlessly. The camera by Robby Muller captures everything with an unobtrusive simplicity that seems random, but certainly not. The cast is great. A classic in every way.
