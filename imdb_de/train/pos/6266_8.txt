This picture is very good for me as it is a most enjoyable and amusing parody of Alien Invaders taking over a city and many of its men. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are all very well equipped The style of the 50s and the entire film is deliberately cheesy and cheesy. Some of the scenes are funny as with the birth of an alien creature. All the actors give full-blooded and serious performances, which makes the movie even funnier and the special effects and aliens at least seem like it. I purposely added the 3rd prize for amusement. <br /> <br /> These types of films often deserve a cult following: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
