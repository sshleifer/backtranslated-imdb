Guys and Dolls is a movie that itches for a remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. His two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake would now be successful with big movie box-office stars, it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version. Its boundless energy can not be recaptured, nor can the sheer joy that you get when you see something like this, a huge widescreen movie with great entertainment movie. I heard last, plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose cream game, as you can often find it, can be found, is famous for the city. If the only place he has left is $ 1,000, Detroit needs the money fast. He uses Masterson $ 1,000 that he can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana the next day. Guys and Dolls is basically nothing but unappetizing guys who usually sing and dance. like here it's fun. It is obvious that this was a Broadway musical: there were not that many sets and the scenes were long. If I wanted to complain about one thing, the songs were uneven. At times there were two songs in one scene; other times passed without thirty minutes. Boys and dolls are never boring, just a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
