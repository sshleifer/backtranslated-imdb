During the war years there were many films filmed by Hollywood to reinforce our public support for our troops. Today, they may be rejected by some or simply viewed as propaganda - which they are technical but positive and intended to unify the nation. This movie is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre - with a pretty realistic script and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character he has played in MANY other films (the hard-nosed, hard-boiled, but "swelling guy"). Randolph Scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look at a young Robert Ryan as a Bombardier in training). While the story is reminiscent of a few other films about our pilots and crews, the movie is good enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it may be to the end - where the film is a bit over the top, but also very satisfying. The only serious negative, and especially for Nitpicker, is that some of the footage is a bit sloppy, and "nuts" like me, who are history teachers and plane lovers, are likely to notice - everyone else probably will not to notice
