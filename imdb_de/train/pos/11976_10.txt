This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie, and Michelle) Her mother is killed by a drunken driver, so her father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living life. The girls go through the difficulties of life and have lessons for life. They develop bruises, friends and many more. The whole show is basically the same as the river. You do not have to hold a grudge, you just have to let it go. I really like this show and it's fun to see it. I grew up with this show and I still look at it today. I'm glad they still show this show on TV. I see it almost every day. I rate it with 10/10.
