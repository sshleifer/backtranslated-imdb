Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence into the film Black Mask. In this film, Li Tsui, a refugee from a super-soldier program, wants to regain the humanity that had taken the program from him. To do so, Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires that he cleans up problems from his past before he can seek further peace. Other members of the Super Soldier Program had fled at the same time as Tsui, but they want to settle for the world instead of finding inner peace. So Tsui is the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from publishing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This movie screams at a furious pace across the screen and never lets go of its audience. The martial arts are amazing, but as they use wires, they may not be as appreciated as the American audience deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting history and good acting skills because they handle both mental and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I'm glad to see that some of Jet Li's films are finally in mainstream versions in the US. I look forward to seeing how the changes required by this release will affect the movie. This is one of Li's best films. Watch him on May 14 when released in America.
