I was fortunate to see a film screening in Stockholm for this elegant, enjoyable and thought provoking film. With romance as the heaviest weapon in his arsenal, Paris je t'aime bravely plunges into love in Paris and navigates in eighteen different "quartiers" through the various forms, but without pouting Parisiennes and saccharine formulas. The Gold Mine is undoubtedly from the Directors' frustration. Frustration about 5-10 minutes screen time? Only the best and safest direction is presented to you by each party. <br /> <br /> To debate whether to check all 18 segments or not, I came to the conclusion that this would only be superfluous and lengthy. Instead, just make sure each director graces the movie with its eccentric styles and abilities, and you'll surely find your favorite one. Although Gus Van Sant can not resist the temptation to be introspective, his LES MARAIS is one of the better contributions, even if he hides in a well-placed Kurt Cobain reference. The Coen brothers reconstruct one of the more accessible segments in Paris, a scene with a subdued but emotionally transparent Steve Buscemi, dead humor and smart camera shots that certainly rightly caused the most laughter in my theater. <br /> <br /> In this way, all storylines are uniquely unique? filtered through the minds of different directors ?? But most of all, Vincenzo Natali's QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE, a dark horror-gothic love, shows Elijah Wood as a lost tourist in the back streets of Paris at night meeting a vampire. With a black-and-white format, but with a blood-red color contrast that seems seemingly incompatible to bleed out of the screen, it almost becomes a pastiche of Sin City? a refreshing eerie and visual twist in an otherwise quite groundless movie. <br /> <br /> My only favorite segment was FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS by Tom Tykwer, but I think I was conditioned to this call as I went to the theater with him as a favorite and pushed my friend in the side too say "finally, this is my favorite director here". However, it can not be denied that Tykwer provides a beautiful segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - exceptionally not annoyed) that she breaks up with him and thinks about their relationship. As with Tywker, the story is dizzyingly fast, kinetically and repetitively. She offers Lola Rennt and is thus the most adrenaline-charged segment in Paris the most powerful tool? Music. <br /> <br /> Obviously not all directors make such a touching impact as Tywker, Van Sant, Cohens, Coixet and DÃ©pardieu. Sylvain Chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by working out a really disposable segment where a little boy tells the story of how his parents met. They are two lonely mimes. This part is so French and so desperate that it offends international audiences. Suwa also leads a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually hard-looking Juliette Binoche mourning the loss of her son. Otherwise nothing happens. After all, the post-processing and interweaving of the 18 stories feels a bit crowded and half-hearted at the end. <br /> <br /> But Paris really owes you the quality, because all the other stories are well-made with crisp action and funny writing. It is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 (I do not say much) and a very personal film in the sense that it is inevitable to choose a favorite and a least favorite. Highly recommended for both the mainstream of the "pretentious" (heh) audience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
