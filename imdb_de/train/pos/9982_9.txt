I saw this movie last night after waiting for ages until it was released here in Canada (still limited). The wait was worth it and then some more. I am an avid reader of Margaret Laurence and was pleased to see that this novel was turned into a movie. I actually liked the movie better than the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a little less harsh and that there was a love story between Hagar and Bram that made the scenes at the end of Bram's life much more moving. The loss seemed to be stronger. Hagar was not more likeable in the movie than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in that role. She was Hagar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and certainly has many great things ahead of us. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on, a total of 9 out of 10. Fantastic and can not wait for it to appear on DVD, a must for my collection!
