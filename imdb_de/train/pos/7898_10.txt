This movie got terrible reviews, but because it was unusual and because critics usually do not "get" any unusual films, I thought I would try. Unfortunately, they were mostly right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film just feels awkward, which is the most disgusting. The feeling that you can not describe is not good. To further confuse, the script is a boring, aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The immensely talented Thurman simply drifts through this chaos and creates little influence. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance, but the script contains nothing. It might have been less embarrassing for them if they had just decided to drift like Thurman. <br /> <br /> One thing that the "esteemed" movie critics did not mention, however, is that the movie is actually quite funny. Whether it's moments of accurate satire or some outrageously strange moments, when those cowgirls hurt with the smell of their unwashed ... um ... chasing their trousers from their ranch, Chortles were all good, though I would not recommend this movie There's entertainment to be had and even cowgirls get the blues worth it for something else.
