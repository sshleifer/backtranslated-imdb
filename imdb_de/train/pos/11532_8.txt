Well, this was one of those movies I got the chance to do, and it was good enough to record when it came out of the norm next time (ie not just another glut of generic sequels), then I think that You can enjoy this. When the villain finally showed up in person, he was definitely not what I expected! All in all, I would not opt ​​for this path, but if you like the genre, then look at it when it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I think. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.
