"Foxes" is a movie that I remember, because it shows teens in the late 70s. Since I'm exactly the same age as Jodie Foster, I've referred to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of the youth. The soundtrack is great with inspirational rock, eg. "More Than a Feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember, even if it was not huge.
