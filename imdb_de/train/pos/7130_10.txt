When I saw this movie, I was really not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, a true family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new foster-father, this movie shows all the boxes. I did not read the book (maybe that's a good thing and meant that I enjoyed the movie more), but in terms of the story I really can not think of anything bad. Always think that something guarantees top marks!). At the time when William said, "I can not ride my bike, DAD!" I sobbed my heart out (whoever saw it will understand, I'm sure). Really heartwarming and definitely recommended.
