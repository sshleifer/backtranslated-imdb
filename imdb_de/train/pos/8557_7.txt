I have to hand it over to the creative team behind these "American Pie" films. "Direct To DVD" usually stands for cheap, incompetent filming. However, last year I was pleasantly surprised when I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took the opportunity to deliver a slippery but funny little movie. This year they offer the successor "Beta House". That's the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is not an inhibitor, tasteless, sheer fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we will be introduced to the main characters, the new subordinates, get a handful of crunchy gags, hit the bad guys and set the general storyline. With everything out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limit ride. The gags are plentiful and they have NOT held back in this case. I'm talking about male semen, urine, dildos, chicks with tails, sex with sheep, female orgasm sprays and much more. Not to mention the fact that no minute passes without breasts or sex scene. <br /> <br /> Back from "The Naked Mile" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (similar) supporting act as the last films). The entire cast works well. In particular, Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has a great deal of energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film also contains excellent movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh in the movie was the parody "The Deerhunter" for me. Classical. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you feel at home with "Beta House". It really hits the limits of good taste, but in the end it's pretty funny.
