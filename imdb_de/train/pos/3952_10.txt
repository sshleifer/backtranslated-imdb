I feel like I have a rare disease that nobody has heard of, and I finally found a support group on the net! I finally found this title when I asked for an answer on an "expert" page on the Web. I also saw this film in my youth and was impressed by the atmosphere and especially the end. I have never forgotten it and have not seen it since. No one I know saw the movie and I had almost given up on ever finding the title. Unfortunately, even if I know the name, I'll probably never see the movie again because it's not commercially available. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
