When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely focused on the screen. Its size kept my attention to such an extent that I focused on it for the entire duration. I would not just recommend it to fans of anime, but anyone who likes great movies (or really likes strange stuff). The style of the art is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism in it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text in the film, but I think the way it is performed adds to the film's alien style. The self-described description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find and see more works by everyone who did this.
