Rarely do I encounter a movie that is so fulfilling that I have to talk about it immediately. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment and very authentic. I happened to see the dubbed version, but I'm on my way to get the DVD remaster with original Chinese dialogue. Nevertheless, the synchronization did not bother and sometimes brought a seriously funny humor with it: "Poison Clan rocks the world !!!" <br /> <br /> Storytelling remains true to Chinese intrigue, tension, loyalty and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists and turns when the identity of the 5 poisons is revealed and an expert pace. <br /> <br /> The martial arts choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. It's like watching real animals fighting each other, but constructed from their own arcane martial arts forms. Such a degree of ability among the actors is unsurpassed in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture, and I recommend it only because of the movie's sincere intention to tell a fight art history and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to pamper people together with the raw forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
