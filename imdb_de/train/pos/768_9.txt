Filmically, this film stinks. That also does so much. But <br /> <br /> I do not care. If there is a strong representation of how the 80s were <br /> <br /> (for many of us downtown anyway) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation and break dancing was really like. Great music, great <br /> <br /> dancing! It almost seems like a documentary of a time when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see how New York looks like a zero point from a nuclear attack. Some spectators <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that in the 70s and 80s it was a poor, run-down city. This is the best of all hip-hop / break dance films that have emerged at this time. Of course, the <br /> 80s are now a joke with all the bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> movies, but those of us who have lived through it will always <br /> <remember> it was lovely for a time when music, dance and graffiti were fresh, yo!
