Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Oscar winner 'Gandhi' of '83. I did not know about any of his works until I recently came across Cry Freedom, released in 1987. Although it may not have been as popular as its Gandhi, it is just as exciting, if not more, and has been released when South Africa has not yet broken the shackles of apartheid. While most movies appear on social issues after the event took place, I think this was released during the time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film is based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the late 1970s. It shows the origins of the friendship between Woods and the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for the role. Washington radiates a natural charm and a screen presence that predicted Biko's character. While Woods initially opposed what he considered to be black racism spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he was unable to move on in his struggles and ideas. The connection between them is getting stronger and Woods and his family are becoming more aware and sensitive of the situation of the people Biko represents. <br /> <br /> But finally the tragedies strike and Woods must now focus on escaping from the South Africa with his book so he can release it and let the outside world know what's going on. The second half of the film is a gripping story of his escape from South Africa with his family, and will keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> There are also some deliciously humorous dialogues. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I am in favor of a confrontation. Lawyer: Is not that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I have a confrontation now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments when you return to the horrors that permeated the land before a better meaning sets in. The scene in which the army opens fire on a protest from schoolchildren is painless and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must. I would suggest that those unfamiliar with Attenborough's work take their time. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are films that make life. The latter I would prefer every day.
