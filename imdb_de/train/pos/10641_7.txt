This Dolphin Lundgren vehicle is a fun die-hard die, it will not win prizes and it's not very original, but it delivers the goods you would expect from a Delf Lundgren movie. Our Man Dolphin is a former soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner-city high school, and if he is taken over by terrorists, it's up to him to save the day. Sure, the script will not win any Oscars, it's a lot of fun and it has a fair share. Delphin Lundgren does a good job, but he gets livelier in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors, but they keep him good. All in all, the detention is a pleasurable action movie, but you've seen it a million times already.
