The second alternative story of the Gundam Universe (G-Gundam is the first), Gundam Wing is another look at the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found, but Gundam Wing is actually different from its counterparts. The biggest are the Gundams, nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In fact, the series will not become a series about war until Episode 7, but in truth, the real conflicts, the Eve Wars, will not happen until the later episodes. <br /> <br /> The best part of this series are the characters. All the main characters are made concrete throughout the 49-episode run, and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they use. Another great benefit is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs make some of the other Gundam colleagues ashamed. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is how many UC fans claim they would break away from the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when Gundam Seed's more apparent UC clone is on the market is a mystery to me. Of course, there are many moments that have been told in new ways, and there are also significant differences. <br /> <br /> Take for example the usual comparison between Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more of an outsider in the Alliance and, in a sense, OZ, while the Red Comet was the symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs loses many soldiers under his command, hence the other nickname he gave in the early episodes: "Murder of his own men." Char does not get this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the philosophy, but two problems. The first is the reused animation material of the Gundams attacks. Sure, it's fun to see Heavy Arms attacking tanks, MS and planes for the first time. But the fourth reuse scene like this is getting old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series should take place for a whole year. If you really think about all the events in the series, a lot will happen in a single year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily dismiss this fact if you ignore the first few lines of the intro now and then. It is probably the best of the Gundam stories of the Alternate Universe and a great introduction to the Gundam world. After all, this was the first Gundam anime that aired on US television.
