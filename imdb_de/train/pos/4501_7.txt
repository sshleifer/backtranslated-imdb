This group of English professionals is a pleasure to see them. The side occupation could form its own series. It is a love triangle between the head of the surgery, his wife and a new, handsome boy who is in surgery. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and the sexy Robson Greene raise this from the dustbin category to a very enjoyable "game". The only point of criticism is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and marry Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is hardly an international or even British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would light their fire and apologize to the Doors. The guy who almost steals the show with a great "relaxed" performance is Owen's dad David Bradley. Watch him in "The Way We Live Now" in a completely different way to get an idea of ​​his product range. Daniela Nardini is the secretary of the kitchen, sometimes a sex toy, as the spurned lover Kitchen excuses him for ever looking at her great body is hard to forget. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as green buddy buddies, as I said, could have their own series. You are so good. The whole thing is a lot of fun and I heartily recommend it and thank you for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating place.
