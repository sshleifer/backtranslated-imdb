It would not surprise me if Soderbergh were pressured to avoid making Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was before the revolution. Just reciting a few stats will not make it to the younger crowd. However, the first part, which is almost completely shot in the jungle, captures the feeling of this place, especially when crossing the mountainous regions of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of the personality of Che Guevara. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, has done a good job despite all adversities. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is also clear that he will not sue her case at "yanquis" far from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I read. As far as I know, Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to assert itself in the United States were exhausted. But in other ways, he is right, especially with regard to emigration plundering, as the island took control of other rebels. The treasury of the country was left empty.
