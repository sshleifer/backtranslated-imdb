Anarchy and lawlessness reign in the punky village of Elk Hills. The city elders are made up of tough, veteran Vietnam veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance of Kris Kristofferson) and some of his animal mates to clean up the place. The plan gets angry when Aaron and his cruel Elk Hills take over after eliminating all the bad elements. It's Aaron's decent brother Ben (amusing by Jan-Michael Vincent) to stop him before things get out of hand. Author / Director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage whips up a delightful amoral, cynical, and viciously subversive Redneck drive-in exploiter of today's Western winner: he creates and maintains a gritty, unobtrusive tone Fast-paced and immobile throughout the world, it stages rich action sequences with considerable muscle appeal (the rousing explosive climax is particularly strong and rousing). The first-class cast of familiar B-feature faces is a big win: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet hot girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as fluffy saloon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as feckless mayor, David Doyle as slimy bank president Andrew Stevens friendly gas station attendant, John Carpenter director Charles Cyphers as one of 'Nam veterinarians, Anthony Carbone as smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as a folky old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a mean strong arm shakedown bully and Dick Miller as a talentless pianist. Morally: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's glittering cinematography, Gerald Fried's vibrant, harmonious Hillbilly Bluegrass score and lush brute force add to the trashy overall fun of this unjustly neglected little fool.
