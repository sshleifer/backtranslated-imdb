I absolutely love this movie and would like to have it someday. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace. I loved it and would like to see it again! I do not remember too much about it, but that an Indian boy lives with his family in a beautiful village and I can not remember what's going on, but he's supposed to go alone into the wilderness. His sister grabs him with something to eat and he leaves. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you ever see an eagle with a turquoise necklace, it's the boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, especially Native American legends, and I would love to be released on a DVD someday.
