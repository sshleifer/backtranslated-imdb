Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home, but have changed in some ways. In the first story, our former cult member is now in a lunatic asylum and is visited by a registered man who wants to find out what was going on in the cult. Slightly slow the story in flashbacks, while the two sit on chairs and face each other. Reporter is particularly interested, leading to the death of the participants. What seemed pretty boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a startling twist in the story. Things are getting pretty bloody. In the second story, a violent young criminal visits a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have some sort of agenda, but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things slow down a bit and become funny. Then there is a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> The final story deals with spiritual healers who claim to be able to remove the disease from their bodies with their hands. One of the patients is a former cult member, which complicates successful healing. Again we are surprised by a turn. Has a pretty bloody scene. <br /> <br /> For some reason there is some beautiful female nudity as well as male nudity. I found the stories very well written, and the director manages to plot every story with its surprising twist and bloody aftermath. <br /> <br /> Note: Review of the German DVD.
