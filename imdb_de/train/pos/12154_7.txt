Yes, a tap dance horror thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Good Good. This is denial and pugnacious and part of the Guignol cycle of the 60s, which came in the 70s. An intriguing double film starring the Burt Reynolds comedy FUZZ, this crazy fear is so pervasive that it's entertaining through and through. Like a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OTHER, and BABY JANE, I suggest that every potential viewer accept the idea that this is almost an inclination and sits with someone you can scream through. Actually, you get drunk while you watch it ... on cheap champagne. Many of the film ideas of the 30s are also about delusions. the struggle of the times for a better life, which becomes embittered and twisted by killing emotional madness. But this is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA, the De Niro - Winters Shlock Fest, which makes this film positively glorious.
