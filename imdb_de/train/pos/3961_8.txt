This is the opus of the Swedish king Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely has a film of this size been shot in Sweden, and it really is one of the most amazing achievements in Swedish film that has ever existed. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to move to Sweden. However, his plans are ruined by the Russian military, which kidnaps him and informs him that he has arrived in Sweden. This trickery is her way of ensuring that Markov continues his work in atomic physics, which will revolutionize the energy supply for the entire planet. The CIA, however, is determined to bring Markov to the West and send her ninja to liberate him. <br /> <br /> The practice of Swedish actors speaking English has been perfected by Mats-Helge in his later works. The cheap B-movie feeling this creates is probably unequaled for the performance. But apart from that? Well, the action is standard direct-to-video style. Machine guns fire huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People walking around in black ninja suits trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What's really striking is the insanely bad way the fight scenes are choreographed. When you say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts and melee. But in this movie, maybe there are two or three scenes of the current martial arts. And they are funny. It's so bad that I miss the words to describe it. As the ninja moved slower, they stopped. And of course, the entire movie ends with a bang that points to a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonalds coupon. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant classic, of course. Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously consumed with a lot of alcohol. It's the ultimate party movie. Insert in video and laugh. You just have to know that films like these are not made anymore. This is movie history. <br /> <br /> Therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
