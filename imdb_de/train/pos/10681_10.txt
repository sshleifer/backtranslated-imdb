While the British produced some witty and smooth sitcoms in the 1990s - ab fab, males who misbehaved, one foot in the grave, etc. - the 70s were the true golden age of new exploration areas, including the sexual revolution, feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for "sensitivity" that would become political correctness 20 years later. Attempts to deal with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything, from the sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to sitcoms like Man About the House. (In the late '70s, this "grappling" led to more meditative and bittersweet sitcoms like the masterpiece Butterflies.) Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly posh, cheeky, fresh, cheeky, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made observations of the present life. Compare it to a cynical show of the '90s like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe they were born in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 70s, right up there with good neighbors (the good life) and over the house are George and Mildred. Its quality is confirmed by the fact that - as in Good Neighbors - its creators, writers and many of their actors on British television continue to be successful.
