I had low expectations for this movie but was looking for something unassailable for an evening. I'm totally thrilled and a bit surprised when I left the theater. This is a very nice baseball tribute movie and a nice lesson about following your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and his performance touched me. Definitely a full price ticket and a few hours worth your time!
