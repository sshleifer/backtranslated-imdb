Intelligent, dry and exciting, "The Invisible Man" was in the usual line-up of Sci-Fi in 2000, balancing "Farscape"'s fantastic art direction and sometimes melodramatic scripts with tricky, cynical plans and modern noir dialogues. The show was between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility meter, but the fact that the characters of "I-Man" went beyond the cartoon could not be denied. Even characters who remained predictable, such as the Keeper, the Official, and the Eberts, were rejected by the Formulaists. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that developed and moved elegantly, which became even more remarkable with the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects must never overwhelm the plot, and science sometimes bordered on the absolutely incredible. The low points of the show are still entertaining, and I have never seen such tense pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be recommended, and fans have the right to request a full DVD edition of the show. Every time I see a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I rolled my eyes and sighed for the excitement and potential of science-fiction television, the "Invisible Man" and its like being represented, to mourn.
