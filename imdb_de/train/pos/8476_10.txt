*** Spoiler * <br /> <br /> My dad had this movie for me when I was three years old. At the age of five, I had seen him over 400 times. I just saw and saw it. And I still do it today! It has a dark story, the mother of a lamb is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like he does. After years of training, the lamb becomes a really REALLY evil eye. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs no matter how much he wants. In the end, he kills the wolf, but is no longer seen by his former friends as a lamb and can not return to his previous way of life. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are .. Well, okay, and the voice output is better today than some things. <br /> <br /> All in all, you only have * this * movie to watch this movie. It is very hard to find today. <br /> <br />
