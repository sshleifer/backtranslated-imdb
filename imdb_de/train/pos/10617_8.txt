Beautiful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels to Solvang, California with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to host a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have failed and all the hotels in the city are full. So you travel out of town to a secluded place and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Kellers (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). If you do not know, Ernest and gentle Mother Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hides a big secret in her cellar. <br /> <br /> A deliciously crazy Lassick plays the real monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It is slowly but surely building up to an intense confrontation / climax that delivers the horror in small doses until the last half hour. The hotel and the unsuspecting basement - here great echoes of "Psycho" - are great scenery. In the perverted plot mainly incest and patricide are included, so the movie gets a really dark quality. And it also becomes poignant when we realize that Junior is not a one-dimensional evil bogeyman, but also a victim like the girls. The last shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a solid little horror strip to discover. <br /> <br /> 8/10
