I enjoyed this movie. I thought it would be an excellent political thriller about something that has never happened before - an intelligence agent who runs badly and is involved in an assassination. For Michael Douglas' character "Pete Garrison" they unfortunately think that he is the mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady! Since he does that, he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph test, and that makes him a suspect number one, when it became known that there is a plot to kill the president but at the same time he still tries to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I do not always care about the people he plays, but he is a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is (at least here) as good as the SS boss chasing Douglas until he's convinced he's told the truth. When he does that, they work together in the finale to discover the plot and then stop it if they can. By the way, the crooks are also interesting. I have never seen a first lady who looks just as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> This is simply a smooth action strip that entertains from start to finish. Are there holes? Of course; probably a number of them and a reason why you see so many critical comments. However, it is struck here wrongly. It just is not smart enough for the geniuses here on this site. My tip: chill, just ride along and enjoy the action and intrigue. Yes, it will be a bit Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it will get good grades for the entertainment ... what is this what movies are about.
