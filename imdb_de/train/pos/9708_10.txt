I never really looked at this program, even though it was highly recommended by members of my family. Funnily, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the filming location) and she mentioned some sights on my first visit. <br /> <br /> That caught my interest, so I bought the first series on video and sat down. In addition to recognizing some locations, I was not surprised in the least. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG is probably the best place with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say, I'm excited about the program now. The characters are great and show an unusual depth while retaining an incredibly realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect, reflecting the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no disrespect to Hadfield, which I found very inviting and warm). I just hope it stays that way throughout the run (based on the 2nd series, which finished its replay in the UK last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Well done the BBC !!
