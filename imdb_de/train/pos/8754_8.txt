I saw this movie 11 years ago with my best friend. I got my judgment teeth pulled out, so I did not feel very well. <br /> <br /> I really liked it very much. It's a tough guard, considering that it's friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking and the extremely difficult situation that relates to living in a foreign prison at the highest level. Two of the women I craved the most and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as sweet and charming as ever while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and performs excellently. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many changes of action to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. It also shows the difficult times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie. Not many films like this have been made in recent history. It should make you think about many things ...
