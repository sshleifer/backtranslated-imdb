Stoic and Laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance of the ever-reliable Kurt Russell) is thrown onto a desolate, remote planet after being played by the unscrupulous and arrogant Colonel Mekum (who Isaac Isaacs has played deliciously on the slimy grip) Todd is considered outdated and his comrades replaced a new generation of genetically modified fighters. Todd joins a peaceful, collapsed community of confidants and must defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, who is working on an intelligent and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, shows a daunting vision of a bleak, cold and harsh environment that will be possible in the near future, while maintaining a pervading pace and a harsh, dark tone throughout , In addition, Anderson masters the moving moments of humanity (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously suppressed emotions is truly poignant) and stages the rousing action scenes with rushing enthusiasm. Russell gives a strong and impressive, almost pantomime depiction of Todd; He conveys a lot of emotion without saying much, and instead, the bulk of his actions make his body movements and facial expression. The support of Jason Scott Lee as brutal rival Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as friendly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty, seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the happy one Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensitive Mayor Hawkins. Better yet, this film gives a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical power. David Tattersall's sophisticated cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing orchestral score and world-class special effects further enhance the overall quality of this superior science fiction / action hybrid game.
