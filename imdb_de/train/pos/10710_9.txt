I really do not have to agree with Guy-Yardley-Rees, who (had he seen the entire movie) saw some stunning Scottish scenery (some of the best ever shot in Skye) and found a movie that had a difficult start really moving whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. It's more like a movie that gives a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can not say how much "standard" movies bore me - the same polished stuff over and over again. Seachd does not seem to care about it at all. It really seems like an attempt to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any other Scottish movie. <br /> <br /> OK, so the drama is not in the style of a blockbuster. That's because the actors seem to be real people. I actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really takes a second look, as there are many threads that become clearer the second time - that really fits in the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) stunning visuals as well as a collaborative approach to the acting and non-normal structure has made Seachd an unmistakable and distinctive character. Memorable movie More of it please!
