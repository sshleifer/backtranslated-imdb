After seeing this movie for the third time, I think it's almost Adam's worst movie. PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS ARM By comparison, I have to say, in the end, when Dickie is thrown off the boat, it's so funny (the hair is different from his and I like it when he drops everyone off.) This movie should just be brought along, if you're a true Adam Sandler fan.The characters are bad compared to his funny movies like the Waterboy, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante), who is one of the assassins trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This film lacks depth and a decent storyline and deserves to be among the last 100
