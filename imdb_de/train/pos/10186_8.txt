Okay, I know that does not make India look good. The main theme of the film is not India, but Shakti. The power of a warlord and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go horribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the changes in their lives are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a pure cameo compared to the credible desperation of Karisma Kapoor. It is easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of life in this movie and sigh at the height of relief and sadness. The musical deposits are strengths, believable and well done.
