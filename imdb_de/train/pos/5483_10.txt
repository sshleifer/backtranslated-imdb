I really enjoyed "the revolution will not be televised". It gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that in Venezuela, the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when her coup failed; After the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court and the Constitution, as well as the Ombudsman and the electoral boards and all civil rights, nobody took out the conspirators somewhere behind a barn and shot them. They did not even go to jail. The main conspirators live in Florida and carry on. And the protection they had was the "Bolivian constitution," which was adopted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just the story that bites. Democracy can give you a damned sip if you let it go. And in Venezuela it is easy.
