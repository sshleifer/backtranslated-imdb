This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I've saved you a lot of time to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, you do not like this movie. If the case is the other one, you will most likely like it. It is so easy. <br /> <br /> If you read this now, then I expect you to be like Arnold. Good for you! He is pretty good, right? The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. It has the usual retro future that we know so well from the B-Sci Fi of the 80s, it has a lot of horrible one-liners, loads of violence and explosions and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <In this case, the vicious opponent is the 1984 controlling, all-controlling government that uses television as effective crowd control in gladiator game shows. Of course, Arnold lands in one of those shows and turns everything upside down, with the help of his two Confederates and the handsome Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets that would help. It's hopeless 80's, but I find that lovely. The acting is different, Arnold makes his usual grunts and screams, with a touch of stone faces. Heroine Amber is, to put it mildly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Lady Killian is a typical vicious TV man. Despite all the shortcomings, the film shows its message very clearly; Television is an opium of the masses, a great way to control people. It also has some futuristic digital video editing at that time, allowing the bad guys to switch faces in a video to deceive their audience. This does not seem to be futuristic today, which is a bit alarming. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen Arnold films, you know when you will see this movie. Enjoy.
