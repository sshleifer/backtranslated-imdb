I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I had read and seen many classics before, and I believed that most of the classics were boring, over-formulated and over-rated stories with at best best practices. This mini series by Jane Eyre has fundamentally changed my mind. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a great actress, and she gives a wonderful performance of Jane Eyre. Her accent is sexy and her calm but firm style fits the character of the young governess. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me believe he was born to play the brooding master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after seeing this miniseries. The plot is both insistent and inspiring. The characters are performed masterfully and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, check out the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
