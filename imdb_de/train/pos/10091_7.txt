I first saw "Elephant Walk" for about 30 years and was surprised how similar the story of the superior "Rebecca" is. As others have said, you have torn the sweet, young thing from the alternately charming and brooding gentlemen of the mansion, only to see their marriage threatened by the inevitable memory of a larger-than-life but deeply broken relative. They have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that either holds the couple together or irrevocably tears them apart, through the fiery destruction of the lavish farmstead. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Elephant Walk also owes some from its ghastly jungle atmosphere to "The Letter," the love triangle of Bette Davis, which is more on a Singapore rubber plantation than a tea plantation in Sri Lanka. Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars and IMDb readers are not much friendlier, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked nicer and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man who can not shake off the influence of his arrogant father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The Best Year of our Life" - is wasted as a frustrated admirer of Elizabeth. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors sets in film history.
