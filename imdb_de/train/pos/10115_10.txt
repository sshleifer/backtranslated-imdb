This film looks at the atrocity in Derry 30 years ago, commonly known as Bloody Sunday. The film is well researched, played and staged. It is as close to the truth as we will come to the conclusion of the Saville investigation. The film puts the cruelty in a temporal context. It also shows the cruelty of the soldiers on the day of cruelty. The shameful white wash that was the Widgery Tribunal is also treated. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an excellent drama that moves and shocks. When the Saville report comes out, watch this movie again to see how close it is to the truth.
