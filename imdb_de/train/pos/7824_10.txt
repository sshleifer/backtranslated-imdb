As everyone knows, South Africa has suffered for a long time from the heinous, racist repression of apartheid that completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the murder, reporter Donald Woods tried to bring Biko's message into the world. In "Cry Freedom," Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before he's arrested Charges As Woods tries to spread Boto's word, he and his family live under threat of assault and eventually leave the country. The last scene shows the police firing on demonstrators. <br /> <br /> As one of two films (along with "A World Apart") that helped launch the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" may well be the best work of all involved.
