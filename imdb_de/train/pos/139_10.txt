Above all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and thriller at the same time. Nice combination of strange "dogma" style where the story is told along with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no end. That's unacceptable to me. I have considered how it will be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse. ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should do something different for RIGET III. I am sure that the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So here is my suggestion. Mayble a bit stupid, maybe not. I know that Lars likes to experiment. So why not do a little experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution is to create puppet animations (such as Trey Parker's team America) or even 3D animations. I know it's not the same as real actors, but basically I think it could work ... That's the only way to bring actors back to life. For Riget fans this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done in a good way, the average "watcher" is considered normal after the first movie shoot. The most important thing is history now. It is completely understandable that it is not possible today to create Riget 3 with the actors. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the possibilities it offers you! Even a marketing! Great director ends his trilogy after 10 years with puppet animation. Only dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 someday ... or even just watch the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and I expect everyone here is hospital "by Stephen King ;-)
