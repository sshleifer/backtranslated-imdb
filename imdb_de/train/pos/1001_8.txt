Kind of a funny and handsome action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as an ill-fated, fast-talking rascal picked by an overly demanding US Treasury Secretary (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York picky computer thief to find. Hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the Treasury and shot two guards. <br /> <br /> "Bait" marks the second feature for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and it does the job quite well, even if it does not surpass its first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which perform very well. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is initially annoying, but throughout the movie I started to catch. Hutchinson is wonderful as a mastermind who as John Malkovich can be reckless and patient when the late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as an agent who has the ingenious plan to get at any price at any cost.
