This movie is nothing less than a dark, gritty masterpiece. I can be biased because the apartheid era is an area that I have always felt. But I would say it belongs to Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately I had never heard of this movie until a few days ago. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company. I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his deceitful role well. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is none. It's real, wild, and gloomy to the very end, and I'd say I'd say bring a box of handkerchiefs with you. But movies as great as these let you ask, why are the biggest movies never to be heard?
