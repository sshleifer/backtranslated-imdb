Four macho boys and three sexy girls venture into a remote forest area in search of a bear. The eclectic group meets crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (a downright scary rendition of Alberto Mejia Baron) who does not surprisingly run out of strangers entering his compound. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III tells the gripping story at a steady pace, generating a lot of nerve-racking tensions and delivering a lot of graphics with the brutal assassinations (a nasty throat slash and a hand thing) blown at a shotgun rate than the definitive gruesome splatter highlights ). The capable performers give solid performances, with particularly praiseworthy works by Pedro Fernandez as the cute, humane Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as the Feisty Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the lovable Charly and Tono Mauri as the antagonistic Jerk Mauricio. Better still, both the delicious blonde Marisol Santacruz and the pretty brunette Adriana Vega provide some delicious eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits. Antonio de Anda's sleek, agile cinematography, breathtaking woodland scenery, Pedro Plascencia's sturdy, soul-stirring, rousing score, well-developed characters, and pleasantly neat 76-minute runtime enhance the overall sound quality of this blast. Horror / action hybrid winner.
