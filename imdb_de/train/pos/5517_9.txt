Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment that not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different with the biopic genre. Chee: Part Two is the excellent highlight of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the features of the first, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant approach, without forgetting the intent to break the traditional rules of Biopics admire Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they are mostly successful. <br /> <br /> The last message of this film is perfect and contains everything we have about the life of Che Guervara has just been reported. The only mistake I found on Che: part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant. First, it is a bold and fascinating experience that challenges the viewer and makes us think.
