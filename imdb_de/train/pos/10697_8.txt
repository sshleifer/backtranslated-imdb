Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good acting by both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a good job of imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring employee. For the men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very personable. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected twists in the story are good for the suspense. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was a surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
