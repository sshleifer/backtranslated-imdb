Brilliant movie, the next best movie to The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and have not seen this movie in 15 years, but still as good as it was then. The acting was horrible and the dubbing was even worse, but it was the features that make this movie (and many other Chinese kung fu films) great. The choreography is great and the plot is simple. I've never seen the 36th Chamber of Shaolin, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr. Return to the 36th Chamber is played by another character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu.
