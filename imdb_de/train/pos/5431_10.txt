I've seen this movie many times and every time I look at it, I can not help but talk about it. Gunga Din is one of those classic films filmed in Hollywood's Golden Age, when the actors themselves had to involve the audience in a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man-made "monsters" to carry a scene. The charisma and on-screen camaraderie demonstrated by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is extremely entertaining and entertaining. The tongue and cheek posture in which the three actors play their roles looks impeccable and immaculate. Some may consider it "stupid", but I think it is "classic" filming and acting. In this film you have to remember that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and the public went to the movies to escape the horrors of war and talk and be taken to a place where people were bigger than Good would do the life and their exploits Good would always defeat the evil. Gunga Din perfectly achieves this by making the audience laugh at the actors and their actors during their hectic escapades. In short, it's a classic movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the audience.
