It's a very tough movie that combines scenes between insane people in an asylum and the blending of images and vague, intertwined narratives. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) takes on a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife and possibly save her. But she is obviously angry, crouching on the ground and has the rest of the time a blank expression and fear, misery and confusion on her face. The filmmaker sometimes switches positions and we see vague pictures of her at a pond drowning a baby or clutching a drowned child. She is tormented by something. When the point of view shifts to her or to other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorted lenses and the like to show what crazy people see and how they react. And the place is teeming with madmen, laughing, hiding and dancing frenetically day and night. Once the man tries to bring his wife out, but the night outside the door scares her and she runs back to her cell. Gradually, the man gets into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to steal them, and he kills the doctor and many companions, and all the while the madmen are laughing and applauding. When he wakes up, he is relieved and wipes the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japanese life, the streets and buildings of the 1920s.
