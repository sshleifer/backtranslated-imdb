I almost did not rent it because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the darkness that I liked too. The only part I hated at the dental ferry was the two red neck brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but this was not a comedy. It ruined the movie for me a bit because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was what a horror or suspense movie should be like. The make-up was good and I have seen far worse movies than this one. It was a simple story with credible acting. It's not the scariest or greedy movie, but I was not clicked or wanted a refund after seeing it. There were previews of other films on the DVD, which all look good and I will watch them.
