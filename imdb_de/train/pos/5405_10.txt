My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We have seen it a few times and it was the best. Too bad that a new Pokemon has not spoken this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> The iron masked Marauder was pretty mean when he captured Celebi with his dark ball. Good thing Ash and Sam managed to pull him out of his control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the endpoints called Cele-Brate Has been a hit since the previous three movies and people always love this movie.
