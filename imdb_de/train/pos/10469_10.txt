I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 years old then, and now, at 22 years old, it feels weird that this cult show has seen its beginning and end and looks back on it so far, what a great decade. Anyway, I've seen MonsterVision all the time because I'm a huge fan of monster movies and horror movies. It was like the 90s version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not Joe Bob's show, MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many comments and information from Joe Bob about the movies were just funny. Most of the films shown on the show were B- or C-quality, but there were many A-House films as well as Hammer movies from England that are first-rate, as well as many with the stop-motion Majesty of Ray Harryhausen. Many were strange movies that you would not see anywhere else like the Japanese sci-fi movies, apart from Godzilla, which is known to almost everyone, and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of film conservation and more independent directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC as they already have a hit at the IFC Grind House Show. I am sure that this show will one day be picked up again for nostalgic reasons. I think I have to wait. Until then "this is great TV"!
