Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the wife of a major entrepreneur who inherits $ 1 million in life insurance when her husband dies in a plane crash during a business trip. At first, she is suspected of being responsible, as her husbands recently did. She has changed, and so she has an insurance broker Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her tail, just to make sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece, to collect her inheritance, but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, whose identity Baumer is now known for, tries to protect her against a lover of her husband Lara Florakis, who, however, along with her henchman Sharif, tries to kill both of them for a share of the money she considers legitimate. And here begins our masked murderer with his brutal murders. Lynch, as is usual with our hero, is initially suspected by the Greek police and is warned by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli a familiar face in Giallo and spaghetti) from leaving Athens. Lynch is then supported by the great Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings. If you say that more can ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it, it's enough to find that there are enough red herrings of them, it's plausible to mystery / thriller fans in this story-driven Giallo close. The DVD No Shame has an excellent transfer with both English and Italian soundtrack. It's also a very catchy score for Bruno Nicolai, who will stay in your head for a while. All in all a first class giallo.
