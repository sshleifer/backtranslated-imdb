Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at his best, and for fans of Maggie it's great to see them in their early days and find Ustinov every step of the way to timing. For English people in their fifties (and I'm in that brace) it's always entertaining to see and hear glances at the swinging sixties, and though this movie spends a lot of time in offices, it has a lot of nostalgia for the sixties, including red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu, and a delicious shot into the microrock of a waitress she's never seen before in England. As I.T. Engineer, I know the computer hacking tricks are ridiculous but should not be taken seriously. Even the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans are not.
