This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer. I had tuned in and expected only a decent TV movie, but I was drawn to the intriguing way the story was told. As others have said, there is much to admire here, which unfortunately is missing in many major theatrical releases. <br /> <br /> Much of the merit must go to Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent script and direction attract the audience it is impossible not to feel emotional. The spectacle of the entire cast is also excellent, especially that of the two main roles Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing portrayals give credibility to their characters, and the scene in which they hold their first committee meeting after perestroika is truly touching. <br /> <br /> If you prefer crime films with a bit more depth and a better setting, a little less gloss, I strongly recommend that you look for "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
