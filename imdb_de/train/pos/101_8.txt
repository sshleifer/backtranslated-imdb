IMDb lists this for some reason as 1972, but the other sources I've seen, including the outstanding program notes, mark it as '68. It does not matter, except that it's interesting to see this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art they seemingly merge) within the 2001 Star Gate sequence, which was released the same year , Pure abstraction is not really my cup of tea, but I can take it in small doses, and the oversaturated, optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, reed blots, birds, etc., are pretty captivating and pretty pretty. Of course, this has paved the way for many other emerging video artists in the '70s and deserves to be known.
