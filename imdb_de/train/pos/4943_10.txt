This is the easiest and the best filming. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because although Freeman is a great actor, he sometimes gets involved in bad projects. This is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> It's a little story that takes a little over an hour and fifteen at a time when we're getting used to the fact that movies are getting longer and not necessarily better. The director takes advantage of the short time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the beginning (by the way, great portrayals of Freeman and Vega) that the little bit of background information on them seems real, Morgan himself is himself The name is not mentioned He has not been to the cinema for several years because he was steeped in business and was afraid to get involved in a script, and does research for a character in an indie film in which he plays a store / supermarket manager. The story begins with passing into a supermarket in a harsh area where he meets the cashier of the 10 or less items (Vega) and has to drive with her because "the production" has forgotten to pick him up. <In many ways it's a road movie. Morgan's unbeatable smile and positive outlook make him laugh and talk. He is an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to define everyone he sees in a figure he could play, and Paz (incidentally, an extraordinarily beautiful woman who is even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25- year old separated woman working harder than anyone else without getting any credit end job in a crappy supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a talkie, there are many dialogues, but the balance between light and fun and seriousness and Sad is well preserved, the characters are immediately so adorable that you spend the last 20 minutes and beg It's a weird couple more screen time, but the brevity lies in the nature of the story, so it was a good call for the director not to give in.
