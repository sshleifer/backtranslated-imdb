Kate Beckinsale is outstanding as a manipulative yet irresistibly charming Emma in this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I was sometimes rather doubtful that the protagonist really deserved to be considered a heroine of the story. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation saves Emma from herself, so to speak: she is portrayed with the innocence and generosity of her character in mind, and one can not help but give in and love her (not to love) despite her less endearing qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main reason, but not the only reason why this TV series is so appealing. Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, who fully expresses the personal magnetism of this character (which is all the more conspicuous since this role of Ewan McGregor in the 1996 film adaptation of Emma was not handled very well) and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. In short, this production is a great achievement that you can often see with increasing pleasure.
