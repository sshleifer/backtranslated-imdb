Titanic is a long but well-made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the unfortunate journey on the unsinkable ship. Writer and director James Cameron has done a great job turning this film into a fictitious love story between two very different people, combining them with the real Titanic event that set on iceberg on April 15, 1912, and thousands of human life demanded perished in the frozen waters of the North Atlantic. The two main roles in the film are great in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good couple on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had real chemistry together, which makes the romance that finally blossoms between them much more believable. Both showed real talent when it came out, and both have shown this in their latest films. The rest of the minor cast, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role, is just as impressive as their characters that bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, the suspense and the special effects are great especially for this time. The horror of the characters' situation felt so real because it really happened that most of them wanted to survive this life and death situation. The pace was a bit slow at times and it was a bit long, but the rest of the movie made up for the few mistakes. The Titanic is a great date movie that will make any girl cry. The fact that this really happened has definitely contributed to the film, which pities you for all the lost lives when the Titanic sank into the Atlantic after an iceberg. All in all, Titanic is a tragic story in which two people fall in love while falling in love with the ill-fated ship brought to life by the extraordinary performances of the cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, who are definitely worth the movie.
