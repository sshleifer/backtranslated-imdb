"Sexploitation" of children is one of the most serious problems our world faces today, and I feared that any film on the subject would jump directly to scenes of explicitly sexual nature to shock and disturb the audience. After watching both 'Trade' and 'Holly', a movie caused me to change international laws. The other felt like a feeble attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a useful or necessary strategy to turn this topic into a Hollywood tears wreath and I have to recommend the "Holly" brands for being subtle but powerful to deal with the terrible conditions of these children are unfortunately forced to endure. 'Trade' fluctuated between serious and stupid, with scenes depicting the death of a cat after pictures of children forcing children to do horrible deeds. I found this incoherent and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I had a cheap laugh, I would not have signed up for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to see a strong movie that really means something, I would suggest saving the movie ticket money for releasing 'Holly'.
