I first saw it on a German television channel in 1975 and was immediately enthusiastic, after that I've seen this movie in cinemas about 12 times and nowadays I have a videotape that I see at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every way (Direction drama, editing, score ...). The sets are outstanding and very impressive. The idea of ​​a devastating world war, which began in the late 1930s, seems like a prophecy for a 1936 film. The dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just charming, believable and ideally as "the hero". The positive tone in terms of technology and progress is refreshing for today's most pessimistic standards - especially the final scene, which brings tears to my eyes again and again, even after I've seen the movie so often. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV, but it was made for the big screen, so if you have the chance to see it in a movie theater. please do, it is overwhelming.
