Like other people who commented on "Miss Doctor," I accidentally stumbled upon this little gem on late-night television without first hearing about it. The strange mixture of a mushy fiction story about a sexy, but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched depiction of the war in the trenches on the other hand fascinated me from the beginning /> For me this is one of the top five films about the First World War (the others are "All Quiet On The Western Front"), "Paths Of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the post-war period "La vie et rien d'autre". ). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really cool. The horses and men appear with their gas masks as riders of the Apocalypse. I just wish I had the movie.
