A wonderful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. After all, cinema is a visual medium and Igor has used his full potential. A young restless man gets on a train without a destination. In one of the compartments he meets a girl. No words are exchanged, but the laundry is washed and from there we are taken with other characters and situations. The two leads are perfectly matched, as their unique features tell a story that requires no words.
