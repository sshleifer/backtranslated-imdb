It's interesting how the research train can flow. I read an article about Cristo's "The Gates" in Central Park. The article states that the Maysles have been Cristo's filmographers for years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their work. I think one of them went on, but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Gray Gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station in Boulder, CO, is the place to look for the dark or unusual look, and of course they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and what a glorious past it was. Edith was wealthy when Bouvier was born, married, had some wonderful relationships, and became a singer when she was forty. Her daughter Edie was a debutant, a model and had many beaus. She never got married and came home in her thirties to recover. She seems to have some nervous disorder. Too many worries about things. However, it is only a shadow of the world they live in, for Jackie O. has come and reared the flat so her aunt and cousin would not be driven out. It is a 28 bedroom villa that is worn and worn. But in the movie you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings you will see that it was very dirty. Edie's outfits are very clever and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to go naked, but not in the film. Edith was really beautiful and you can still see the shadow of her beauty singing "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's portait, she says, "At least someone does what he wants"!
