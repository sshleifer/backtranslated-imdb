I have just completed this finely designed and beautiful-looking movie. It was not clear if I was wasting my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the awfully distracting commercials. Reading the previous comments convinced me to give it a try. The worst thing that could happen is that I could fall asleep during one of the boring but lengthy bug spray ads. Why did I see it? Mainly because if IMDB gives a movie a "WEIGHTED AVERAGE" of 5.8, the STATISTICAL AVERAGE OF VALUES was 7.3. It has to be a sure success. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled that I took the time to watch this movie, commercial smallpox and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze her ability to take on tough roles by adapting her core person to each role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this movie by the tough but intrusive human police officer was beautifully done. If the scene demands fast, witty and timely verbal traffic, she can handle any actor. However, she is very adept at delivering emotional responses without uttering a word based solely on facial expression and body language. Without the commercials that kill the continuity of a good movie, this would have been a real eye-catcher. I gave a 9.0
