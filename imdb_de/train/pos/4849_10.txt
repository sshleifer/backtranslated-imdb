The Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate the typical humor of the 1940s. It involves World War II in the plot, but not as much as I initially believed, and the characters are a unique mix that plays their roles pretty well. Askey plays the role of Tommy Gander and picks up the story for the parts that could be portrayed as boring or "sluggish" daily standards. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is fantastic to revive the mystery of The Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members, while the rest gets along quite well. It is always in the center of attention and can be described as "annoying", but that's of those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes seeing sweet. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Askey / Gander, then this movie would be shorter in action, enjoyment and results would not be as effective as my opinion.
