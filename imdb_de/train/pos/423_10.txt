I've just read the storyline and it's the worst I've ever read. This incredible movie will not do it justice. An example of a good summary can be found in the list under "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a kid. My sister and I could not wait to see it on TV every April. It is one of the best horse movies of its time. It's one of those great classics that the whole family can see. The romance is clean and adorable. The plot is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies anymore. Good acting and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are best along with many other great character actors.
