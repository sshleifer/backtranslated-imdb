Director Samuel Fuller creates a brilliant visual outfit: the heated pickpocket inadvertently lifts a microfilm out of a woman's purse; it turns out that she is a courier for the Communists, and now she and the grapple are being watched by the police. The Film Noir formula is all its glory - before the ingredients became clich√©s - including waterfront locations, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and a hell of a fierce pugilistic fistfight. The ideas of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are just on the right track, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the knockout supporting role as a "professional stool". Exciting, atmospheric and tough. *** from ****
