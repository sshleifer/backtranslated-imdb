The film begins with a group of children in the Reform School and focuses on a child named Gabe, who seems to have worked hard to earn his probation. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start, and soon Gabe meets the Dead End Kids. The children in this film are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than in previous films and in depth they are well-meaning punks. However, in this area there are also some criminals who commit fraud by arson and see Gabe as a comfortable scapegoat - after all, he had reformed the school and nobody would believe that he was innocent after being in a frame. So if Gabe is ready to be sent back to The Big House, it's up to the rest of the gang to rescue him and expose the real crooks. <br /> <br /> The "Dead End Kids" appeared In several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s, the films were generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the boys' contracts expired, they went to Monogram Studios and the films were, to put it in charitable terms, very weak and formulaic - Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were pretty much the entire show, and the group became "The Bowery Boys ". Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had the excellent writing and production values, AND Hall and Gorcey were not constantly in front of the camera, this is a pretty good movie - and almost scores 7 (it's a real approximation). The movie is not exactly a great movie aesthetically, but it sure will be fun to watch it, so I'll give it a 7! Sure, it was a bit hokey - especially towards the end when the kids took the law and Reagan ignored the Bill of Rights - but it was also very entertaining. The Dead End Kids do their best and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still funny and quite charming - so if you can put up unbelief, that works fine.
