I saw this movie again after 37 years. I was eleven years old and caught this strip in South Beach at the Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it is! was a very good movie. Well, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old war between the generations. However, it has found a place in time that is just a memory. It's really interesting to see the mod fashions, the old Vegas, a slender Don Rickles, chain smoking, and a hip opening song. The acting was decent, the script a bit dated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is can not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a nice and entertaining journey into the past.
