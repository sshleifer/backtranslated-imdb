This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, better yet, you could buy it because you're likely to watch it over and over again. I remember seeing this movie as a kid, and it was great at the time. But after reviewing it yesterday, I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (though not as great as "Mr Magoo" - one of the favorites) and action. This earns 10/10 and I hope that they will soon continue (thumbs crossed). If you need babysitting or taking care of small children, I would recommend renting this movie since it will entertain them for hours :).
