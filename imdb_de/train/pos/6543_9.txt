I read Nancy Drew as a kid and collect the books as adults. I loved the effect that was used at the end (and a little bit at the beginning) of the film, where line drawings in the style of books turned into scenes from the movie. It was a nice way to show connections between the situations in the film and the books. For example, the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer reminded me of many scenarios that I remember from the books. I thought Ned was perfectly staffed, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st-century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
