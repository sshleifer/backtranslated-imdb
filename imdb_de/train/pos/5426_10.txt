It is time that Gunga Din appears on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I've seen this beautiful movie, but I never get tired. The leading actors have worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can not overcome her successes in India. Your first look at the Sergeants Three is when you see them fighting a so-called treasure map with other soldiers. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communication line, and they enter a mostly deserted city - or think it. <br /> <br /> They make the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" hiding. Soon after they are attacked by a group of lunatics, they can hardly return to base. Later, they are sent on another mission that gives Sgt Cutter the chance to search for gold with Din. They find the temple made of gold and are enclosed by the evil Kali followers. Din is sent to get help, and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive at Din, and they are too trapped. <br /> <br /> In the face of the killing, they watch helplessly as their regiment saves them. The evil doers look on and are about to surprise when a wounded Din climbs the golden dome and blows his bugle, which then alerts the English to the ambush. Din is shot dead. <br /> <br /> The soldiers attack the bad guys and soon defeat them. In the end, Din is honored when he was named corporal of the British Army.
