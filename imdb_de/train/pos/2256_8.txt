Did not know what to expect from Van Damme's partner & friend / coach / and his fight choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him performing as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer" and other Van Damme movies. Now he is alone. He and his wife form a great team. In this team, Qissi is the action director and villain good, really amazing, his wife was the author, producer and director of most scenes that did not require action. She has also done a good job cutting the film. Together they did a great job well done, the leads were real fighters and looked good - the story came together well and if you can believe it ... no bad language, no sex, just action. A new thing for me.
