Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is somewhat predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH, because the theme and the framework are obvious). That's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It essentially means that the filmmakers will not end up as they might have done in an American version of this story. THE BOOTH is inexorably moving toward its (anticipated) conclusion, but at each level is so beautifully designed that you can enjoy the ride as you might do on a well-known cruise along a busy (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky short story, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost tangible. Worth a nice long look
