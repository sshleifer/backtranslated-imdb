Thinking about this movie, I can imagine two others helping him to put him in perspective. A relatively forgotten place, but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon, the others thousands of miles away and much larger is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a film that produced some of the great foundations of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the dignity of Potee and his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and his white bosses. I was also impressed by the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. The latter gives the film its driving force, the latter combines this film with Indochine. <br /> <br /> One is never sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters need a memory of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that binds her to Coup de Torchon. Their story is more scandalous, perhaps even more interesting in a corrupt way, but Denis reminds us of all the tensions and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American giving France a ride at the beginning and end of the film gives another interesting side to the confusion we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says when he came he wanted to call every brother. He came home, but they just thought he was a fool. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but both are not sure what it is, though they can remember what it was like. <br /> <br />
