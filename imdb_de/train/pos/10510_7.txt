This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally okay, but I found Jeremy Northam pretty wet as Mr. Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is pretty good, but I preferred the Kate Beckinsale Emma. There are excellent support services from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often played too much, it makes you laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set pieces and the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely missing. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenery. It is way too abundant. England has never been so. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do it that way. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, I enjoyed this movie, but would recommend the TV adaptation more.
