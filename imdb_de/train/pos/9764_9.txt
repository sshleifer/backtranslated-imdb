I saw this movie in cinemas when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then and recently purchased a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and kept asking to see it. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed seeing it too. Although I have to admit that it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I have no older children so I do not know what they think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter sings her again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope that helps.
