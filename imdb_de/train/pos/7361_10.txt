This movie would normally be rated as the worst movie production ever. Ever. But in my opinion it is perhaps the funniest. The terrible direction and the script make this movie priceless. I bought the movie when I searched the cheap DVD's in my local pound shop. Me and some friends then looked at it, even though they were pretty drunk. It soon turned out that this was not a normal movie. Instead, a priceless relic of James Cahill's latest film. At first we were confused and shouting that the DVD player should be turned off, but in our abnormal condition no one could bother us. Instead, we have the film directly reviewed. In the end we realized that we had found some dreamer, something that you can laugh for hours while laughing for wrong reasons. We soon showed all the other friends and also they agreed, this was not an abysmal movie. This was a movie that you can really wet when you laugh. This was a movie that everyone can enjoy. That was awesome.
