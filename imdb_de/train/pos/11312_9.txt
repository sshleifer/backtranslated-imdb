Ossessione is in very poor condition, but is being fully restored at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a "master-positive" 2nd generation, originally from the print that Visconti was able to hide from the fascists. It was scanned on the Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed with the DaVinci Revival recovery software. After that, the rest is handmade and we do not expect it to end before early spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully on HD-DVD. This movie is beautiful and we hope the restoration efforts will please many generations.
