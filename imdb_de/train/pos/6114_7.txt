A really sweet film that has some similarities to 2001's hit "My Sassy Girl", but which can enchant the most time. The biggest applause should go to the two leads. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and quirky, Kwon Sang-woo is attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim used CG inserts to refresh the visuals and offers impressive battle scenes in which Kwon Sang-woo can shine. I liked him a lot better than in the highly overvalued "Volcano High" here. And this boy has a future - these looks, these fighting techniques and a romantic track. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can make it short: nice movie. My rating: 7/10
