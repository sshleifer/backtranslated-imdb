I think the reason for all the rousing diarrhea in this movie is that most people have it for Sharon Stone, who is about 50 years old and shows herself naked while he plays sexy. Nobody cared when the Golden Girls Cheesecake sat and talked about their first orgasm. But if someone wants to be digitally happy after menopause, it's probably too much to handle. Let's face it, it looks good, it's light years hotter than my mom, who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but since the turn of the century, all moviegoers seem to be expecting: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be too. It's an erotic thriller that's both erotic and exciting, a sequel to a brilliant character we all hate. It is the character of Catherine Trammell who has helped to give in to this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more of this icy ice queen. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and artistic direction were lush and extravagant, and I wanted to switch to Britian. The score is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Sure, some characters have exaggerated a bit, but there are brilliant works by David Morrissey that are virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> The script has a setback practically the same as the first movie, which only included a psychiatrist instead of the policeman. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to reduce the film even further, which takes away from the shabby amusement for which the story is known. <br /> <br /> At least it's entertaining and fun to watch, and that's the only intention of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, you may want to SEE the movie and make your own conclusions before throwing up your projectile.
