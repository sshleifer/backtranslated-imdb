"The Enchanted World by Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the life of the man who brought us films like "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster" and of course "Plan 9 from Outer Space". This exquisite film goes far beyond what other documentary films such as "Look back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion" failed. It sums up its surviving entourage, many of whom have died since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that he looks back to the darker corner of past Hollywood, sentimental in his treatment of the director (except for the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must for anyone who loves the director who can not make it day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively unite Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. Best of all at 3 o'clock in the morning in an angora sweater.
