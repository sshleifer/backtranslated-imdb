Of the three remakes of this plot I like them all, I have all three on VHS and also a copy of it on DVD. There are just enough variations in the scripts to make all three entertaining and revealing. In addition, was another movie recreated three times with such star casts in each movie? Of course the main stars in this movie are great, but also the supporting actors are great. I like William Tracy especially as Pepi. He was such a scene thief that I searched for other films in which he is located. He appeared in many, but most are not available. Like the other comments, I say too - buy these.
