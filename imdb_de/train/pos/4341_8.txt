Who has no unsolved problems with the parents? And which parents do not have unsolved problems with each other? I know that sounds hard. But this is laughed in the movie, which improves both the comedy and the drama. I always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk and although I was worried that their star qualities would be too big for a little movie, I was thrilled from the first scene were the discoveries the son made about his father as a person. And Peter Falk's soliloquy of being a diligent, self-sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balance. Without this scene, the movie would be much less nuanced and the character less interesting. <br /> <br /> Nicely done, Paul and Peter!
