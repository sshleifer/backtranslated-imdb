This is the first review I wrote for IMDb, so nude with me, but I caught this movie on HBO and was certainly glad I saw it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as a passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great and there's never a boring scene slowing down the movie. Some parts of the movie that deal with crazy sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a thriller like Se7en, you can handle the scenes well. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie has received in the IMDb and definitely look at it.
