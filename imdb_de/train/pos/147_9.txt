The stories in this video are very entertaining and it's definitely worth a look! The first one is a young couple who are abused by two rednecks in the woods, with a big but inexplicable turn at the end. <br /> <br /> The second is best of all and worth watching. - A man is attacked by a dog he fears will be rabid - He finds refuge in a hospital, but he finds out that the employees there are not exactly what they seem to be ...... Great shoot in the end, and this episode alone is rated 10/10! If the others were equal to this, it would be 10/10! <br /> <br /> The third is the weakest of the group - A girl meets some guys and has wild sex! It seems to have no sense of history, to the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the terrible first part! Nonetheless, this is a great movie that does not work, you're wrong! Worth a rental!
