This is a collection of documentaries that take 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 image from artists around the world. The documentations are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts. The only thing shared is 9/11 as a topic (in some cases very minor). Some segments are weak while others are very strong. some are political, others are not; Some refer only to 9/11, others simply use September 11 as a theme to touch human emotions, emotions and tragedies that are universal. Some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic. No one has censored this movie in any way, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments could tick off the far right (one from Egypt, where one dead American soldier and one dead Palestinian bomber are returning as ghosts), another from Britain, who tells the US-backed overthrow of Chile on September 11, 1973 in 50,000 Deaths and terrible cruelties). The segment from Mexico was the strongest and reported the fall of the towers and the resulting death in a vivid way (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Even if the final product is uneven Because some segments are almost "pointless", I still recommend it. It is very difficult to rate this film as the segments vary widely (some weak, some very strong;). I rated this with 9 out of 10, just because some segments were excellent and covered issues that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
