Youth, sexuality and the French countryside - one of the more unique films you'll ever see. If you can see it, it's no trifle, considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it is erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A little boring also in the middle, but all in all, one can not call oneself a lover of bizarre films, if one has seen this at least once.
