I thought that Hugh O'Conor, as a young Christy Brown, was amazing and really deserved more recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant too. My favorite scene is where the boys play football and Christy uses his head to stop the gates and then beat the punishment! Amazing performances of the two Christys (and others).
