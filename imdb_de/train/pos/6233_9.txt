Musically, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another perfect musical to Top Hat, if that was possible. Although in this case, like this Jerome Kern confectioner Roberta, in which they were, Randolph Scott persisted with another singer, this time was Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire ex-Vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now the two are on shore leave. Fred and Ginger pick up right where they left off, and Randy accidentally hits Ginger's limp sister Harriet, who turns out to be a real beauty. But Randy is a typical love and leaves her. <br /> <br /> Once again, Irving Berlin wrote a hit score, strictly supervising the production. With Let Yourself Go, Ginger can really make excellent vocalization to which she and Fred later dance. But the real hit of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, a number made at a navy show. First sung by Astaire and later danced by the couple, Let's Face the Music & Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Her dance on this is absolutely magical. <br /> <br /> I am sure that if I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who that is. But you will know immediately when I mention her in connection with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's right, Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet did not sing anymore when she just turned into David and Ricky's mother on TV. Then she did not even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on TV. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet really could carry a tune. She sings behind me Satan and The Moon and I'm here, but where are you, both with real feeling and class. I recommend following Follow the Fleet if for no other reason is a dimension heard from Harriet Hilliard that has been incredibly forgotten today.
