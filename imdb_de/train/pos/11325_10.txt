When I heard about this series for the first time on AnimeTV, I have to say that this show surpasses anything I've seen in any show I've seen. I had to watch this show, and I really did. When I got the first band of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the fighting scenes were fantastic. I have to say that my favorite characters on the show were Saber, and Archer and of course I like Illya too. And of course, all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others), who plays the voice of Berserker. He has a cool character. I even reviewed the entire series before seeing the final issue. So if you see something good, then watch this show, it's the best.
