This is the biggest movie I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is rich and makes of these 11 short films a beautiful artistic act. According to the technical information (the elected directors) I was afraid it would have an anti-American base, but ... it's kind of (11 times) personal tribute. <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: He does not manage to "swallow his pride" and considers this event a well-deserved punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the movie, but that testifies a true freedom of speech for the entire piece. The strangest comes from the Mexican film of almost conceptual art ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu means. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and have either made me smile or make you cry or even startled. I still do not know if S. Imamura's fable is really related to the September 11th disaster or not, but it is so pretty that its final location is "profound".
