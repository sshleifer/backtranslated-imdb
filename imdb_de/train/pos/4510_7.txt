In the effort that Martin Luther King's spirit is not only in the bourgeois freedoms of the United States, but in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, the Danish helper Niels Arden Oplev transplanted this belief in a Danish middle school from 1969. More specifically, he works Join in the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his repressive rigid and abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted to a true story, the performances are performed with some sovereignty, and a refreshing command over the various characters keeps it up. A clash of ideologies between 13-year-old and insane discipline gives way to inherent humor, but unfavorable shifts in mood disorders, even though he is more than a "Matilda" in the same vein as a "Dead Poets Society." It's a familiar path, but a continuous and precise service for his young protagonist, including a personal subplot that rounds Frits down as a young man, manages to turn the movie into a rousing family movie whose nose lies on the money.
