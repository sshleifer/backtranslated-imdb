I have not read the Kurt Vonnegut book it was adapted from, but I know some of his other work and wondered how it would be translated to the screen. Overall, I think that this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It is the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to empower senior Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans through his weekly radio program. But when the war is over, he is denounced as a war criminal, but flees to New York, where various strange twists await the plot. But for the most part of the movie, the Schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange action is performed with skill and serenity. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three extreme right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a high-ranking Nazi in a jail cell. We recommend.
