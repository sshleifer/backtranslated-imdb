You know? Our spirit is based on this revolution, it sleeps ... I can explain, I think !! Well, until this happened on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we got them in the revolution, the Portuguese people seem to have lost their mind, we use our not free speech! This is all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear! ... About the movie ... I think it has some flaws in the acting style of some characters, but by the way I watch Portuguese movies that's pretty good !! It like it very much!
