"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure movie with a certain charm, although it is not one of the best Disney works. It has a generally good story, beautiful songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and charming landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and animation very well. The animation itself is of course pretty good. The animation is similar to that of the animated film "Robin Hood" from 1973 and the same applies to the animated characters: There are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others, as in "Robin Hood" " King (a lion) being a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins" with one Both combine live action and animation with similar artwork, both of which have similar settings in London, both with their own magic and a magical woman, and the kids (Carrie, Charlie, and cute little Paul) are a bit like the bankers. Children: Both films were cast by Robert Stevenson and David Tomlinson, but instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a happier and more magical man - Professor Emelius Browne - with his magic also some slight but significant similarities with the stories of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> The majority of songs are good. "The Age of Non-Belief" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is nice too. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is great again in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great because Miss Price and the three little actors are all right: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a boy in the "non-believing age") and Roy Snart as his youngest brother Paul br /> <br /> I like the black cat. It's pretty cool. It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch". I think it's cute when one of the movie's characters turns into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love her! It is even funnier when Professor Emelius Browne is turned into a white rabbit, because when he transforms into a human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really funny, combined with its funny character and mustache. Overall, this is an okayer movie, but its ending is pretty bad. The first minutes of the film are nothing special, but they improve considerably. The end, however, is weak. This is my main criticism, for the most part, because the animated knights are a bit too much for me and also because of the feeling of war.
