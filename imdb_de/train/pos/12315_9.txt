There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list, and there is little criticism. This is because this movie offers great entertainment and has something of everything. <br /> <br /> Younger children may find it a bit scary, but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic action, humor and even beautiful music in every way. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they are watched regularly and now that it's finally available in the UK, I'll certainly do it to add to my collection.
