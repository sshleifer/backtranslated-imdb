Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. Instead of the enigmatic thematic structures that may be conspiracies or no more than vivid nightmares, this time Lynch offers a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal themes of aging and the family and finds affirmation in both. The simple, true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) driving a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, battered brother, there are still many unique and original visual dreamscapes (some pretty eye-catching aerial photographs of the heart, filmed by The experienced cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an indisputable lynching effort and characterization that are some of his most memorable. Farnsworth is outstanding in a stoic but friendly way. He lets the stories he hears on his journey become part of his life, and Sissy Spacek puts some of her best work into a smaller role than his mentally challenged but attentive daughter (her painful daughter). The mystery turns to a poignant one Sage revealed by a gentle twist in the sensitive writing of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast provides an indelible performance to a person, one of the most notable is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both intrusive and sad. But this is the vintage Lynch with its ability to motivate and unsettle you in the best possible way. For those who are unfamiliar with Lynch or know it only through its violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent starting point. For those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.
