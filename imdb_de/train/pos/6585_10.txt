After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should be so uninspiring as to imagine he could approximate Mr. Brett's account of a "most interesting character in the literature." Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no one else. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a mere second, but still the second. One could argue that Mr Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the absolutely first-rate productions that Mr Brett offered, and I would agree with that. But when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only actor to become "real" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject, and we, the public, have enjoyed the unique performances of Mr. Brett. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
