This is definitely NOT an intellectual film with a profound mission, so I really do not think it's too much to not understand if you're not a Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, pretty funny and sometimes morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), according to the authors. But no matter, the genre is really different and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to teach you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh, and there is a chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> Not bad movie, not the genius, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
