I did not research the movie before my first look because it was part of a Welles box set that I had recently purchased. A boxing set that I got mainly because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and also wanted to re-evaluate Waterloo. So I put Orson and Rita in the player and I'm treated equally classes and confusion. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the story seemed simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and rescues her from a couple of thugs they immediately click and man gets offer on a cruise with wife and her famous husband, and then ............. <br /> <br /> ..well it becomes a murder mystery of plotted demons and many shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not really know what's going on, he's just as confused as the viewer, and that's wonderful to see, since he gets taken by pretty much everyone in the movie. Obviously being dragged off the heart by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but all you know is that things turn pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> So many wonderful things In the film, Welles visual style is ubiquitous, it's a wonderful scene to see in an aquarium, and the end sequences in a fun house are majestic to the eye. The story of O'Hara is cheerfully mocking and we get it Good Light Relief through a lawsuit with Everett Sloane that illuminates the procedures considerably. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is a curiosity, and in fact it is a choppy viewing experience, because {as I later learned} studio bosses cut the movie down for an entire hour, and that's not for us viewers just frustrating, but unfair to Welles' vision. I am convinced that a complete original cut of this film would have been highly praised and revered, as it is a very good and fascinating film that unfortunately only resembles size, but remains a viciously fascinating film that I have I'm glad that I continue to visit. 8.5 / 10
