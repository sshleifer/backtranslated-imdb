This is one of my favorite movies ever and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, ghost), only movies such as The Lord of the Rings Series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home are at their height. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a weird background and has many more friends, the boys are girls. She really sucks you in her life. I certainly can not fault the acting of the protagonist or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting even to someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The movie never gets boring. The romance is really cute and did not make me blush too hard! One thing that really made it was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and throughout the movie there are many colorful Indian conventions that offer a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indians are also funny! Essentially, this is an old-age movie about choosing the right path and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Good comedies become my favorite movie genre thanks to this movie. They are fun, refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
