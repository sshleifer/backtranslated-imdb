There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can not I really? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I'm serious. Do not look at this movie if it's easily offended by obscenity, sex, nudity, homosexuality, and anything connected to nature. Being a woman and maybe not even a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. I think baseketball is the winner along with all the other debuts. I laugh now when I just think about some stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I'll say. It's hard for me to leave that comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse in almost every line that gushes out of her mouth as they speak. So I think it's professional. Best movie. Crap yes !!
