10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a british-indian doctor, currently in india. The word Beckham scared me off because I'm a diehard Liverpool fan and personally think that Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was sure that DEAD would not see the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had a flight in the early morning, so thought, "what the hell, let's take a look at this movie", because it was a late-night show. <br /> <br /> What an idiot I was. I should have seen this movie the day it was published. I guess with Beckham's name you should pull the pull of the audience (which had fallen behind in my case !!!), but I really can not imagine a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (dead gorgeous) and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football and you do not like Manchester United (or England) then this is definitely the movie for you. In fact, I am just 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a child at heart. This movie has pushed "Star Wars" from my # 1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not many comments from Indian Brits like me on this movie. I ask myself why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
