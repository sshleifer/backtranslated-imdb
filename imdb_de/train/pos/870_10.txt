"Read My Lips" (which probably has another idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a sophisticated, curvaceous contemporary history of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a thriller as the oddly matching characters move up and down more ethically , slippery slope. <br /> <br /> The two main points are magnetic: Emmanuelle Devos (whom I have never seen before in spite of their long CV in French films) and even more than ordinary Vincent Cassel (who has brought one) sexy and / or threatening Look and vote in some US movies). <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is in a competitive real estate office, and he's the newcomer. The second half is as ex-cheater on the lawn and their hideous adaptation to this environment. <br /> <br /> The author / director Jacques Audiard cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing impairment as an appetizer for her perceptions. Turn the sound for us the way it hears (even more annoying than usual when the audience is talking), and use visual elements as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters behave as expected (it is not like this pliable victim of "In the Company of Humans"), not in individual interactions, not in scenes and not in the overall arc of unpredictable action (well until the last shot, but the hell the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco for romantic and criminal stakes. There is a side story that is thematically superfluous and unnecessary, but that only gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 28.07.2002)
