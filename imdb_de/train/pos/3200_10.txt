This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the show's chief author and his buddies Rickie and Bubbles play it in a truly satirical view of trailer settlements and the inhabitants of the stained garbage cans. In the movie, you'll learn why Rickie and Julian begin their more advanced thrusts into the world of crime. WHY and the reasons for everything would be spoilers, so I will not name the real reasons for their more brilliant escapades. Your friend and often partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and the absence of the movie does not affect the way you see the Sit-Com. It's a comedy with a big C and a brilliant satire for a trailer park and little crooks with little timelines but big dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to see this program - to buy - to steal, attack it. You'll be glad you did. And to my American friends --- It will destroy you too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV as TV should be.
