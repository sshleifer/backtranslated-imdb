I know that many people have a penchant for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens's story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I have a copy of this film on VHS, and we look at it together each Christmas Eve. I often find that we could see it on Halloween as well, because it is a very scary ghost story. Scott - type Scrooge - is shuddering mean and evil, which makes his transformation all the more miraculous. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The ghosts are all effective, each one is scarier than the last one. When I observe the dark, floating, skeletal form of the spirit of Christmas Yet To Come, every year a shiver passes over my back. And what a side occupation! In particular, David Warner is in top form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I remember that this version of the original story is closer than most of the others - but I'm wrong because I've read it for several years. Anyway, this is a terrific Christmas classic.
