This is a wonderful movie that makes the 50s look stylish. Kim Novak is fascinating and fascinating as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are great, from Jack Lemmon as their bother Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico, who works on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the daredevil and funny Aunt Queenie. And then there's the cat. I have no idea how many witches (except me) called a cat Pyewacket, but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only as much as his character in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending that we believe in, because this year's films have this happy ending. Gillian and Shep are almost as lucky as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie).
