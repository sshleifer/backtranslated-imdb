(No spoilers, only plot details) I can not understand such hatred for this episode. You want to see a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there is a sack of crap. Tom Welling performs well (I do not say that very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but most of the time he is. The scenario of an alternative universe seems incredibly realistic. Martian Manhunter, previously on Static, returns and tells Clark that the doctor, head of the lunatic asylum where they are being held, is in fact a Phantom Zone phantom, and whether Clark wants to return to his universe, he has to kill him. An overall great episode with good acting and good tempo.
