18 directors had the same task: Tell love stories in Paris. Of course, some of them were better than others, but the whole mosaic is very charming - would not it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? To arrange the segments (which may change on a second viewing): <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors, the My favorite segment ever was the always impressive Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Funny and adorable. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") of a little boy whose parents are mimes ; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Children of Men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6th "14th Arrondissement", Alexander Paynes ("Choice", "About Schmidt") a wonderful look for the miserable side of life is here, feat. the underrated character actress Margo Martindale (mother of Hilary Swank in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run") - hectic style acts in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchior Beslon) falling in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise" by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious Cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving story of the talented Brazilian directors, starring Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Enfants Rouges lodging", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais" by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15th "Bastille" by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre" by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18th "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, starring Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I've been able to classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but none of them are just bad. By and large, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" a 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic about love and other things in between.
