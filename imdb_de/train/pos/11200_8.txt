This early film has its faults - a predictable storyline and a few overlong scenes of dubious relevance - but it clearly shows that Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images is clear. It is also stylistically one of the most expressionistic of his films; Consider, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party series and the frequent echoes of title and plot in the pictures. <br /> <br /> However, its core remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Although you know that the hero must win, it becomes quite believable that he loses, and his wife's move from the champion's corner to his, which motivates the final plot, is very well linked to the hero's progress game. The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; You can almost hear the ticking (even if it's a silent movie, the visuals often have a surprisingly hearing feel). The pace is amazingly fast and the viewer is sucked into the excitement and brutality of the game and the sexual jealousy that underlie it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I know of is Laserlight. a public domain company. As with any Hitchcock mute they have released, they have added various music selections, mostly orchestras, to the action. The soundtrack is often sluggish and the sound quality varies a lot, but most decisions seem to be done with care, and the music that accompanies the endgame works great. It is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive movie than its current darkness suggests. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of rewarding boxing films.
