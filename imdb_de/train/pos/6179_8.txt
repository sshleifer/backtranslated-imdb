It's nice to see Vintage Film Buff classify their excellent DVD release as "Musical". This is what this movie is, pure and simple. Like his unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1941), the murder plan is only an excuse for a lavish girlie show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of highly ornamental girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace and Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry, and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also available to give "Cocktails for Two" his strong voice. Undoubtedly the film's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with her "Sweet Marijauna" performance, but also with her strong performance as a rejected girlfriend of the hero. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon Toby Wing. To give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is over-excited and overused, the super stupid Inspector McLaglen simply can not put his hands on the killer, though in this case you would believe is the person you most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen actually endeavors to enlighten the killer himself to the dumbest cinema audience by showing the affected player after the close-up in close-up.
