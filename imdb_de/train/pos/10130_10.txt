The pilot is very well done. It shows how the characters connect in future episodes. I do not think anyone could have made a better pilot for this show. It shows remarkable creativity among the authors. Although not everything was cleaned up, because it was the first episode, the pilot was shown many events that will occur in future seasons. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachel. Although the nervousness of a first episode popped up, she was overwhelmed by an astounding storyline and a stellar cast.
