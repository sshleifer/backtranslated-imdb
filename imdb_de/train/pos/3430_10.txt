I saw this at a film screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was in Awe about the absolute power this movie has. It is a study of the psychological impact on our brave soldiers joining the military in the hope that they will honorably protect and serve our country and be looked after by our government. The film describes the psychological changes that are taking place in the training camp as the soldiers are turned into "killers for their land" and taken to war and the aftermath of returning home. It also shows the impact that killing has on the human psyche. It pays homage to the soldiers and never criticizes the soldiers unlike other films, instead it criticizes a system that is unwilling and does not care about all the physical and psychological needs of the returning vets. This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought-provoking. It is a call to arms to not only support our troops by buying stickers and parades, but by actually listening to them and helping to improve their health and well-being after killing. <br /> <br /> The best film ever, **** / ****
