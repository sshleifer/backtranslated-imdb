Very interesting. The big turnaround was not as big a shock as they might have hoped, and it was very old-fashioned, but it got my thoughts going. That really made me think of a world without vegetation or livestock and to appreciate the world I live in. Charlton Heston does a good job, as do all minor characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. It sometimes lacked direction and many attitudes and backgrounds needed further explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main flaw I could find was that I did not want the movie to end, I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
