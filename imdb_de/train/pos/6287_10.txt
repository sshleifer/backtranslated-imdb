Going in 60 Seconds is a very good action comedy movie that brought in over $ 100 million, but was blown up by most critics. Personally, I thought that was a great movie. The story was credible and probably has the greatest cast of all time for this kind of movie, including 3 Oscar winners Nicolas KÃ¤fig, Robert Duvall and the very hot Anjolina Jolie. Apart from the lame stunt at the end, this is a perfect mix of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (out of ****)
