I saw this movie in pure joy. <br /> <br /> This may be one of the best movies ever. It has a timeless value, you can make so much out of it, it's amazing. There are parts that move, funny and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are perfect, the depiction of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% authentic, even small Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high strokes offers two great views of Cristy (pay attention). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is incredible. I have never seen an actor It is really amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's so great to look at, it's flowing so well, it's probably what you can most likely do with the real experience. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. No doubt, there is something for everyone.
