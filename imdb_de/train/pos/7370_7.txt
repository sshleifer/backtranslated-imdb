Some have compared this movie to liberation. I believe that mice and men are more appropriate. Our lead man, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and irrelevant if this is a sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as the only connection to humanity. The shot, the scenario and the minimal cast make a fine movie. Honestly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But it was important to me what the filmmaker did to them. He has done well with them. I wondered for some time what the end of mice and men would look like. The soundtrack and the cinematography were captivating and fascinating.
