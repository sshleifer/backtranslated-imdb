The Booth gives your typical J horror movie a whole new twist. This film puts you in the footsteps of the protagonist of history. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about the perception of the people who work, live and love, about our protagonist and how he perceives the people who surround him an antiquated radio station DJ booth. The story cuts off the layers of the main character like an onion in flashbacks as the movie takes its course, and we've learned that things are not always what it seems. The film mainly took place in a small, outdated studio of a radio station with a very bad story in which the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show as the radio station was re-locating itself. From this narrow space thrives this film and you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At the time, our protagonist can not tell that the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by a spirit or conspiracy of his colleagues, or that everything came to mind. What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers let you see through the main character's eyes and make you as paranoid as the protagonist. This movie is a very smart, pretty short 76 minute movie.
