I loved this movie very much. It left me guessing what would happen until just before the end. One of the better movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is beautiful, too. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on the wall. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar and it's really an emotional rollercoaster ride where you start with an opinion about what's going on and step on the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood cuisine, but an art house movie. The best thing about this movie is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict by focusing on another's story. It is not guilty or castrated, but lets you draw your own conclusions about things.
