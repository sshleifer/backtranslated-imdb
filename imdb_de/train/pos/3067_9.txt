What a surprising pleasure on late television. Had I only read a short story on television before I saw the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a hit-man-seeing - a shrink-want-leaving the business-losing and falling in love ... sounds banal. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word. The look and feel of the movie is perfect. dark, but not repulsive. <br /> <br /> Apart from the hit-man family aspect, which offers a touch of surrealism, Macy's character deals with his marriage and his father's control. Macy shows a suppressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his little son are amazing. The boy shows acting skills beyond his years and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and I can not believe I happened to come across it on late night television.
