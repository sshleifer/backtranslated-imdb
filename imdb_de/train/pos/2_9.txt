Bromwell High is just brilliant. This scorching parody of students and teachers at a South London Public School literally makes you laugh. It is vulgar, provocative, funny and sharp. The characters are an excellently caricatured cross section of British society (or more precisely a society). After the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for lack of a better term, the show does not shy away from parodying every conceivable topic. Political correctness jumps out of the window in every episode. If you enjoy shows that are not afraid to make fun of every conceivable taboo topic, Bromwell High will not disappoint you!
