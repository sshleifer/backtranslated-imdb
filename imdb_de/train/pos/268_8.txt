I loved Dedee Pfeiffer in Cybil. I have not seen her for a while and forget how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job. The side cast was pretty good too. In some ways, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty scary and the story generally had some good twists. The young friend was a hot friend. I thought the man definitely had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> I just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. Keep my interest and I'll see it again if they repeat it. Can someone else recommend similar films? You can post on the board or send me a private e-mail if you want. Thank you in advance.
