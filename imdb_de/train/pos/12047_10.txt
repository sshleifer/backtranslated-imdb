The first and only time I saw the woman in black was, I think, the only time I appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve, and my father and I saw it just before our visit to the parlor midnight service in the village church. I was still quite young then, but I'm not sure who was more scared when I or my dad walked through the churchyard to the church entrance. <br /> <br /> There are many film factors that make it so scary, but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much in the way of a soundtrack played in almost every Hollywood movie, so that every squeaking, hitting and banging stronger in your head is amplified as there is no distraction. Another factor that differentiates it from other ghost stories is not a jump factor, like things hopped out of the closet. Therefore, it is not necessarily what you see, but what you hear and what you think. This is a smart medium, because nothing scares you more than your own trains of thought, thinking what's around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A great ghost story. I've never seen anything that fits that I can not believe the BBC erased just one show with all the scratches that are repeated on TV over and over again (to my knowledge)!
