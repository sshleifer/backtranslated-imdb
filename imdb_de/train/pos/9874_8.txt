In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is not prepared for the big time by the man who loves her - Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supportive Oscar win the previous year in "Johnny Eager". <br /> <br /> Was not Spring Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of five children with four of them looking like their grandchildren? <br /> <br /> Singing and dancing is just wonderfully staged, but the way the flowering romance between Heflin and Garland was portrayed left something to be desired. It was a Gigi-like, in which a young girl is finally ripped off by a charmer.
