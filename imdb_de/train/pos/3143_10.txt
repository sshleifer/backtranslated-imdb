If a show has earned a 10 in the last decade, it's this rare gem. It allows us to return to a time when it was easier and funnier. Filled with heart and laughter, this show laughs at the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful and even the drugs were bearable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller skates, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place." Take a journey into the most beautiful time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the well-being of the small town, where people were friendlier to one another. This classic is just as much on TV as "Full House". Do not miss it and always remember to "shake your wits !!!"
