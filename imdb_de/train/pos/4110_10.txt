This and "Hidden Fortress" are the Kurosawa's that matter most to me. I do not distribute tens like sweets, but it definitely deserves it, if that. Although it is quite long (as almost all Kurosawa's are), it was consistent with the problem that bothers me in most of his films; The plot is often too loose and is slowly evolving. It contains scenes that are unnecessary or simply too long without the plot or character description being based on any real purpose. Dodesukaden has had the same experience with me, for example, making "Hidden Fortress"; Despite its length, there was not a single minute that I would cut out. <br /> <br /> In a way, this is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie. He has no plot, but many little independent stories based more on music. To character description as an action, like no other Kurosawa movie I've seen so far. She also relies heavily on the dialogue he uses excellently (especially in the story between the father and the son planning their "new house"). <br /> <br /> Yet, what makes this masterpiece a masterpiece is that the subject is as tragic as it is described as human and sympathetic without touching anyone's fingers. From beginning to end it offers the entire emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
