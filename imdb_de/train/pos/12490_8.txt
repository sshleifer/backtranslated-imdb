Allen and Julie move to a cabin in the mountains after their daughter was murdered one night. Nobody knows who killed the little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and is followed by people who killed themselves there, and nobody in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of scary stuff and a lot of parts that made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but sometimes there is a part that I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the end because it let the viewer decide what he looks like ending. It's also a kind of sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
