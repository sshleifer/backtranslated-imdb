I came across this movie on TV and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely guy who falls in love with an extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who would not?). The way Goldie's character holds from the beginning of the film to the end is still uncommon today. This film has given me a different perspective on human relationships and I found it very funny too. Peter Sellers role was a difficult sale, but I think he is doing well.
