A linear motion within a nonlinear structure. It is a fact that the time of 12 monkeys in this back and forth flows between present, future and past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative. What underlies the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little freedom. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, we have been informed about the prophecy of a schizophrenic, according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997. The few survivors are forced to live in the underground - the only place that is not affected by the virus. The mission of Cole (Willis) is clear: Return to the mid-'90s to investigate what and with whomever virus is to be done. There is no way to change the past. All that can be done is to gather information that can help the contemporary scientists (who are the future for us viewers) find the cure. Do not change what happened (the past is inevitable), but improve the present. <br /> <br /> In his "return" in time, Cole is gradually approaching a striking dilemma: his past life is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing and is controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (that word is ironic) to go on a journey back in time. <br /> The scientists are still alive not achieving the highest achievements in time travel, and Cole lands on false dates - this will later serve as evidence of his mind for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe) in the storyline. <br /> <br /> We can see through the evolution of history that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than a moment in which the scene is the first and will almost be the last - and certainly the climax - to appear. It changes according to the memory of Cole's memories that appear in his dreams. In one airport, one man is shot dead while he is gunning for another. A blond woman runs after the murdered man. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (where Cole is a child visiting the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the story). and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the story, Cole feels that he has already lived the reality he is experiencing. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or escape what has happened. The agents who kill him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Doctor Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> What could not be changed. And in Cole's case, that was what's going to happen. Forever. <br /> <br /> A movie that many do not understand properly. Nothing less than a masterpiece for me. <br /> <br /> Other good movies with similar theme: The Back to the Future trilogy (which has a different perspective on the character of the "crazy scientist"), and although it has the atmosphere of decay - especially in the second film - is it much more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that's a strange Hollywood picture. <br /> <br /> Another tab contains "Wild Strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces. This means an exciting and enlightening journey into the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I have never seen "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
