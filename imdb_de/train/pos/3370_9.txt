Just after completing Cronicles of the Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, I'm thrilled, but questions are still in front of me. While it seems that the first 7 episodes are actually a retelling of the events of the first Records of Lodoss War, the truth is that they really are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different idea of ​​how the original ended (and that might be the reason why the first 7 episodes occur), but I do not think so. CotHK says it begins 5 years after the war of the heroes to which Parn belonged. I think the director made the first five episodes look like a recapitulation of the original, just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds, since after the series began in Sparks story seem much less. Once the series has entered Sparks area, we will be in the next 10 years (15 years after the Heroes' War). Spark and his crew are in some cases similar to Parn and his crew as the journey sets in, especially the love story that emerges between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times in CotHK that I threw in the original series. If Spark had not been for long blue hair, I would have pressed Stop more than once to make sure the right disk was in place. However, in the face of these big setbacks, the authors have done a good job creating believable characters and a remarkable storyline , The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ??? Do not get me wrong, both are great villains, though Ashram's only evil quality is that he supports Marmo. Maybe I missed something when I explained this part in the series. As for sequels, I warmly recommend CotHK. I place both CotHK and the original record of the Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.
