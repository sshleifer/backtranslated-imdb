Right. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just a lot better. This film shows Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I obviously have not seen Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd yet.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about that in my commentary on the miniseries. But I missed a few. The film is shot in a better location than where the mini-series was filmed. And the REDRUM scenes are scarier than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But expect nightmares every night for 3 weeks
