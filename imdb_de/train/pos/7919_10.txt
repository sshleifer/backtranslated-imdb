"Full Moon High" is undoubtedly meant as a total joke and portrays the teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) from the 50s, who accompanied his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony gets bitten and gets fur and fangs at full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this film is that he can not age as long as he has the curse of the werewolves and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is just funny when it starts. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing Yahoo (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars' coach / principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most spectacular cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the change of presidents; then Gerald Ford really got him together! Anyway, it's a real treat. Considering that Alan Arkin - a crazy psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanks his sons, I wonder if he remembers being part of this movie with two of them (except for Adam, his son Anthony also a small role). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: Director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killer baby movie "It's Alive".
