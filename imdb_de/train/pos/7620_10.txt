Lost is the best TV series out there. First of all, it has GREAT actors and a wonderful direction. The writing is a very controversial topic, because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after season 3, the writing was very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people believe the authors are lost and have raised many questions and secrets. I think these people are wrong. I trust the writers. I think if the secrets are revealed from now on, all the charm of the show will be gone. In any case, the biggest TV series is lost and it will take a long time.
