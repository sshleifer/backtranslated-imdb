I know that this movie was not originally a blockbuster, but in light of recent Hollywood releases (most of them were decidedly formal, plotting less, meaningless, "Save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter"). What "idiot", the feast of All Saints' Day, certainly deserves a second opinion in this sad context. The film, like the book, loses its grounding in the historical background, but reveals a unique American dilemma that is directed against the only dreadful American institution of human slavery and some of its tragic (and funny and touching) consequences. <br /> <br /> And noteworthy is the young Robert Ri'chard, who is considered the leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets off at the beginning of his "growing up". Just to be cruelly disappointed with what turns out to be his true education on the paths of the southern plantation world of Louisiana, at the apex of the Antebellum period. When I saw the previews with the (dreaded) blond Ri'chard, I expected a buffoon, a nonsense, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, The Last Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy convey vivid imagery and impressive acting skills in the wings of Placage, Voodoo, Creole "aristocracy" and Haitian Insurrection woven into this history of human passion, hatred, love, family and racial perplexity in a society that has supposedly disappeared, yet somehow still with us.
