James Stewart plays a classic western revenge story related to the fate of the other stars of the Winchester Rifle. Of course, Stewart is an excellent choice when he adds a cold, hard obsession to his ordinary, reserved cowboy. The story tells of the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after it was won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he hunts. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of gamblers, guns and Indian merchants and bank robbers as we follow the path of rifles through Indian battles, bank robberies, etc. The side squad is set, with Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean, the live wire fighter with a itchy trigger finger. Also as a trivia note a very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian chief. <br /> <br /> The showdown is a classic, a thrilling rifle fight fought long and hard in and around a ledge. Take some good western actions, fist fights, shootouts and horse-drawn chases for a great western adventure. 8.10
