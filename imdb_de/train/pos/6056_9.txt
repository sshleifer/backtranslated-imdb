Super Speedway is a great demo of your new DVD / Bigscreen / 5.1-channel sound system. The IMAX camera takes you straight into the race car, where you drive at high speed through various circuits that are reminiscent of the driving sequences in the Grand Prix (if only that would appear on DVD!). I keep looking at it. <br /> <br /> The only downside, and why I did not award 10, is that some of the driving sequences look suspicious, as if the movie were sped up. The soundtrack also requires a bit of discomfort - everything you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes when you go under bridges.
