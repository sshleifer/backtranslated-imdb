Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled across this movie version in the late '90s, I was thrilled! This is the best and most complete version of the book about the movie! This version is a bit long to sit through in a session, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I was glad that they occupied a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to watch !!! For those who are interested, I have just found this version on DVD. I almost saw my VHS copy break, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
