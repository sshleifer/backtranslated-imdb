Say what you want about Schmaltz. One beauty of this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a moral that some Americans are called to high ends and how they came to this opportunity. It's inspirational because it's about people with noble intentions. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We were shaken out of the magnolias." In today's political climate, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and exposed the worst of 9/11 characteristics of the people, we sank to the level of 9/11 killers to seek bloodthirsty revenge. It's not all to blame Mr. Bush, because eventually we allowed him to lead us in that direction, and even chose him again after his lies had been exposed. Well, with all justification, we are being abused by Americans all over the world. Today we see this film with a new awareness: that the rise of the Nazis in Germany is not due to a mistake in the US German character, but a mistake in humans, which allows us to rationalize everything, what our immoral and vile acts justifies. I do not compare George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But I point out how a leader can seduce us into an insanity of terror, hate, and hypnationalism to do despicable things. For his own agriculture, no matter how immoral, it is most likely with the leaders of our country, the ones they do and those who put their heads so deep in the sand that they do not even have to worry about the election. </ br> <br /> A film like "Watch on the Rhine" reminds us of what we once wanted - a power to improve humanity - and that we have it within us to aim at ambitious goals once again. <br /> Geoff
