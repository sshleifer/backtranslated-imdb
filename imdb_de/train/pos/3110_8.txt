The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is missing something in the story section, but covers extensive action scenes! Especially Twi takes a lot of time and makes this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and the star (Damon) themselves agreed that it's hard to find a story for the last part because the end is over The second movie was pretty ... advanced in terms on the story. How could you handle this? The action scenes once, but they also did something else that I can not reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you see the movie, you will notice it! Luckily, I read that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films. If that means something to you: o)
