BATMAN: DEAD END I really liked. I thought it had a theatrical feel and the chance that Collora could make a good movie. This trailer did not quite make me that way. The storyline or potential plot was pretty good, but due to the acting and special effects, I felt that this would have resulted in a good TV movie or television program. First, Michael O'Hearn is not a superman so well. I actually thought he made a decent Clark Kent in his brief appearance. I'm sorry, I just do not like SuperMan. The suit Kent wore was masked. Batman may have the bodybuilder's body, but not Superman. Supes is undoubtedly tinted but not massive. Anyway, I did not care about all his poses and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed friendly. Well, this may not just be O'Hearns fault, Collora may have to put up with the bad scripting and the right direction. Second, the special effects for flying were Cheezy. Superman flies through the sky. It was obvious that this Superman was flying near the ground and the telephone wires and buildings above were visible. I do not think there were Superman flying pictures. Obviously, the strap and rigging that O'Hearn supported had been found on his lower torso. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good fan. I would probably pay for a movie if it was ever filmed and would surely watch it on TV. The plot, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Lois' attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface defeating Superman, and the coming together of Batman and Superman is a good one. I'm sure that with a bigger budget and approval for a full movie, Collora and his company could even provide O'Hearn with a decent movie. Surely a better than most comics that come from Hollywood lately.
