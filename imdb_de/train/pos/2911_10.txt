This is one of the best music concerts anyone can ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was brand new, and today to hear from the original artist again is a measure of Sir P. Mc's power to seduce people of all ages. This Doco goes far behind the scenes and shows us the life on the road, not only for the band, but also for everyone who goes up to the roadies. I saw this guy live in Aussie in 1975 and can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that lives up to this claim and can recommend it to anyone, especially a Beatles fan. This is the closest you'll come to a Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just awesome. There are few entertainers who can stand alone with an instrument and hold the crowd in their hands. If you want to watch perfect music, buy a studio CD. If you want to hear raw music as intended and spontaneous for the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
