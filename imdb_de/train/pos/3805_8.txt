After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never hit theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time watching and I have to say that this movie is better than a few other animated films. Of course it has its shortcomings, but I can really recommend it anyway. The animation is well done, very entertaining and unique, and history has made me watch it to the very end. Some of the scenery is just stunning and you can tell the French talent behind it. I thought the performance of Forest Whitaker feels a bit lifeless, but that's the character of Lian-Chu in this movie. All in all, thumbs up, I really liked it and I hope it is successful enough for all involved studios to continue making great movies like this one. I would recommend giving him a chance and being surprised how great a movie with such a small budget can be. Hector alone is worth watching the movie as some of his moments are just funny.
