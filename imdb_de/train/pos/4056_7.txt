I saw this in SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was called "Laputa: Castle in the Sky". I had subtitles enabled, and I think SBS provided their own, which as usual was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> I simply looked at "Laputa" in Wikipedia and it confirmed what I suspected ... The floating island of this fairytale comes from the classic novel by Jonathan Swift "Gulliver's Travels", which dates back to the early to middle 1700s was published. <br /> <br /> However, this is a fascinating Japanese fairy tale that shows an English speaking voice. I think it's suitable for small children, but it takes about two hours, so for some it's too long, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two children looking for a legendary floating island with a castle on it. The kids are not just looking for this island. They have pirates, the army, and spies who are also looking for the island and want to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, Anna Paquin and Pazu, the boy, James Van Der Beek) to help them with the search it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are great ... sometimes photorealistic, especially the torch-lit stonework or pretty scenes on bright, sunny days with white clouds. or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
