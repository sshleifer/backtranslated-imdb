Rarely do I see a movie in which I am totally in love; that was one of them. It had good acting, dialogues, plot and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed out loud many times, especially in the scene about the kitchen robbery. The slapstick comedy that was performed by the Lunkhead Hand had me on the ground, but I admit that I'm a slapstick weakness. The story was about a group of people in their thirties returning to a summer camp they visited 20 years ago. It was a farewell week of camping, because the place was closed permanently at the end of the season. As an adult, the camp looked different and they felt different about it and each other. I recommend this funny, moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
