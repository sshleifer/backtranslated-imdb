Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I waited for it, but when I finally made it, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's weird, but that only gives it an exciting taste. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films by Gackt and Hyde. They did not do a lot of them, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. Give them some recognition. We all know Adam Sandler was not the best at first. I do believe that they are throwing some weird situations in it, but I'm looking at it to find the best points of this movie, the emotions shown, and so on. That's why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 points and will always be there.
