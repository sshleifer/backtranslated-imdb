I was speechless and devastated after seeing this for the first time - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - a documentation of not. This really gives Fellini or David Lynch a chance for their money in the Weirdsville Sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how those women (who clinically go far beyond eccentrics) reveal their own humanity in a most surprising way, and I wonder if the withdrawal from the world was triggered by something beyond the obstruction of life in the unreal blue blood maybe an abuse or maybe just a consequence of defiance and rebellion that has escaped their control and taken on a life of their own. This could be one of the greatest films that come dangerously close to exploitation without going overboard - while the Edies do their thing, I've always noticed things like the empty gin bottles in the debris-strewn bedroom, and cats Raccoon urinating on the toilet, raccoons emerged from holes in the walls, and the final scene was incredibly sad - like a kid's birthday party that went seriously wrong. Definitely worth a visit and search - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
