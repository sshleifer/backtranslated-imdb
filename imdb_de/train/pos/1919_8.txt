I did not read the book on the basis of which / was inspired. Since these are some of the last roles of John Ritter (RIP) (the others are film roles), it's hoped that it's hilarious. And it is. Almost every time he is actually there. Most of the cast, both supportive and regular, are performing well and the material is usually great. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy of that age, Kerry, the depressed middle-class child fighting for causes and consciousness, and Bridget, the fashion-obsessed, beloved Ditz. Sagal returns to be the female lead in a sit-com, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed slightly after Mr. Three's Company passed away, and for a while they did not seem to be able to decide if they wanted to make a laugh or act poignantly and respectfully. One may wonder how or why it took so long thereafter: It could still be good, some additions were happy (if you like David Spade, his part is, for the most part, that he does his fuss) and had a lot to say say . My personal favorite episode is in the last season. The humor is a nice mix of "stupid" jokes (mainly related to the high school students), stupidity, dark comedy and rough material. It was about sex and other adult topics, but never in a graphic way. The language is mild and occasionally moderately strong. I recommend that to any fan of those who did it. 8.10
