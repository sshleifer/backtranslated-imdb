The story was pretty interesting, but the characters were rather shallow and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behaviors. More extreme than necessary. I also believe that something went wrong during the casting. John Turtorro does not really satisfy me as a semi-autistic chess player, let alone the Italian player. The motives were also not very sketched. <br /> <br />
