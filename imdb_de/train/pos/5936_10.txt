I just saw it ... for those who do not know what it is, I suggest downloading the entire feature and enjoying it. It's an amateur trailer with the same producer of the famous short Batman Dead end, but this time around there's Superman as well as the Black Knight ... It would be wonderful if they did the entire movie ... but I'm afraid it would is almost impossible, especially before the official Batman 5 movie. <Br /> <br /> - There is no greater crime against peace than refusing to fight for it. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo 'Purifier' Pinto
