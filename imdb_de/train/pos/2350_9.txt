I have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and hope that the writers' strike does not brutally end the beginning of a very good show. Ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his own peculiar quirks such as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the once deceased but no longer friendly childhood and solar status of Ned's life. Olive is the jealous but good-natured waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narrative of the show. Chuck, Ned, and Emmerson, along with Olive and occasionally the dog, solve several murder secrets with the help of Ned's special gift of bringing the dead back to life. The show is fun, clean and romantic in a very nice and kind-hearted way and I would recommend it to anyone.
