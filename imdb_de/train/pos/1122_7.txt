Four teenage girlfriends are going to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately, they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant low-budget surprise. The cast is sympathetic enough, the direction is stable and the violence is especially vicious and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is pretty dark. The Murderous Sheriff Is Not A One-Dimensional Character In some scenes, it seems he feels remorse for what he has done. The subplot where the two boys meet in the diner is nowhere to go, but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.
