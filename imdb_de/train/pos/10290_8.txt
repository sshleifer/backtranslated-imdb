Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since the Truman Show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his latest "Hey Hollywood - see how well I can act!" Disappointments at the box office. It's great to see how Jim recognizes and embraces his strengths. He will not be awarded an Oscar, but the film itself will take longer than many Academy Awards. He is at the top of his form in his latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. Carrey, Freeman and Aniston are doing a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, super comic timing and obviously having fun together, but without the kind of "comedy how funny I am". A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's Nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show Fame), who brought some of the best and funniest scenes of the film. I have laughed more about Carell in the last three years than anyone else. I can foresee that the religious nuts in the US will embrace the treatment of God, but the bottom line The film is true to all the great theological beliefs - we are a mass of protoplasm trying to make our short lives by exercising our free will overcome. Without married people with children to complain about, this will probably become a target for people with inappropriate priorities (who know the types - men who decorate golden watches and late television on Sunday mornings and sell prayers to God). And again about 0.5% of the country will take care of it, and 80% of the media will report about it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is a purely entertaining film in which every viewer laughingly asks what he would do. and a good feeling when closing the film. A walk through one of the main streets in America must confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor. What a better comic genius to remember than Jim Carry. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - it's great to have you back !!
