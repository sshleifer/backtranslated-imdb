Fresh in color, Kurosawa loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa strives for a style that I think was his antithesis - that is, I feel like Kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture. Bad, poorly thought out, this movie is a rare guy in this body of excellent work. While Ikiru was worldly and depressing, it was still interesting and lively, and while Stray Dog portrayed the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too cumbersome or boring, Desu ka has all the fatigue one would expect with his Content, with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa images. <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a movie Kurosawa should be judged on.
