I'm surprised how much I love this movie, although I do not really like dogs. Fox, Field, and Ameche do wonderful work with the voices of Chance, Sassy, ​​and Shadow, and the acting by the animals themselves is just incredible. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times already (I know that sounds weird, but it's true!), and every time I get the final scenes. I recommend it to all people of all ages and especially animal lovers. It is indeed my absolute favorite movie!
