Cage and Hopper have met with their supposedly lucky readers, and fortunately not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is way better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a third-rate actor, the porcelain baby is a substitute femme-fatal, only daddy hopper is as mean as ever. RED ROCK WEST is one of my favorite American thrillers despite my mundane cast; In short, a thriller with a few twists. <br /> <br /> Above all you notice the excitement, the unbelievable speed, the thrill, the nice excitement, the cute, tight ass of Lara Flynn Boyle, Cage's enviable physical form (though undeniable) ugly, with sharp, birdlike Facial features, thick eyebrows and thin, rare hair, Cage showed a fine overall shape), Hopper's consummate routine, some moderate but really funny moments, Cage's play with his intended person, Hopper's rigid psychopathic charm. Lara's vulgarity, Cage seems to be a Roamer, the archetypal dark roamer of Noir cinema, hungry, tough, if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle acts as a cold, seductive seductress, Walsh as her heartless husband and Hopper as the Lynchian hit man he's made before. Cage looks rather dazed or dizzy or confused and has a serious hangover. But that could be his normal look.
