This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known dEUS group, is not favored by all. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or conspiracy. This film shows only 24 hours in "one city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to see the dialogue, the direction, the humor (Dario !, the osteopath Bruno! ...) and the tragedy (Windman, Paul.) and really enjoy Garcin, ...) Characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS fan, Windman visiting the Osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, some have other viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no story, etc. But it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and pulling you into the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen him yet, you should listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary, as is Tom Barman and his group dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©". (do not tell anyone)
