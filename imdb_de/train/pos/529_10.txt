This is one of the most overlooked jewels Hollywood has ever produced. - A British WWII fighter whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young American consoling the brave pilot and knows he will be dead within minutes. For some reason, the man who should definitely be dead leaves the wreck and eventually learns that he should report to Heaven. When a news station is sent to ask the pilot to escort him to heaven, the man refuses and demands his "day in court" to represent his case. The man argues that his situation had changed in the last moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and had therefore become another person who deserved to live on it. <br /> <br /> The "Heavenly Court" is a cinematic experience! The "announcement of the peer jury" is an absolute highlight. The story, as fantastic as it seems, is captivating and will fascinate you for almost two hours. The last scene is just beautiful and requires a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my personal top 10 ever, it has my highest recommendation!
