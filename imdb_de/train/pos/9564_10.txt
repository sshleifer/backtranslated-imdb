This must be the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine stunning cinematography with breathtaking drama and a gripping storyline, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog During some scenes, I had clung to the edge of my seat while others cringed in horror, drowning in my own tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film left a deep impression on me. These are shockingly violent scenes, in sharp contrast to the poignant and tender love scenes. The film is not appropriate for its Cat III (Nudity) rating; There are no nude scenes at all, and the love scenes do not even involve kissing or making out. <br /> <br /> The message that this movie presented to me? All people, no matter how violent or cruel they may appear, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a great job as a murderous pang. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie at 10/10. It is a must.
