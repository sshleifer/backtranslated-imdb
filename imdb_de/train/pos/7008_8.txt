IMPRESSIVE! What a movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors at all. Usually I do not like drama. I'm not a super fan of Will Smith and even think he's a very good actor ... but this movie! It's such a great movie with such an original script, and so good direction, and it works so well ... wow ... it's awesome. This movie caught my attention on a minute-by-minute basis and I did not even like "The Pursuit of Happiness" (maybe also because I do not like the acting of Will's son, who is a very bad actor while children are usually all born actors) last night in "The day stood the earth still" and I confirmed my feeling that Jaden can not act. I do not want to write spoilers and that's why I do not talk about the story, but I can say that this movie talks about love, death and other feelings that I do not like to see in movies ... but THIS FILM is such a super great movie , If you have a minimum of heart, you will not regret seeing it
