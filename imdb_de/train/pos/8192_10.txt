This two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. Certain parts of the story have been stolen from previous films, but what televisions do not do these days. What we got here was a good science fiction story. A big, really terrifying monster trapped at the base of a deep pit, some great aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens that spawned the revived series, a series of basically sympathetic and believable human characters (complete with a few unnamed "expendable" security men in true Star Trek fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some top-drawer special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
