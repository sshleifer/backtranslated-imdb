I rented the domino on a whim, not even knowing it was inspired by a true story, and although this is the most likely and likely biopic you'll likely see. I found it pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly he writes a lot of action and narration in 2 hours of pure entertainment together. And if you've seen it more than once, get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a less subtle or perfect career. Director Tony Scott offers a fancy, sour trip style. With fast music and fast editing, it provides a visual excitement to get your attention. With smooth performances and unexpected comedy, the movie is well done and fun and should reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained for two hours at a time.
