Although I played the role of Sheriff Hodges in this film, I still managed to jump in several places and believe that I'm NOT that easy. You could say that I'm biased towards the movie and OK, I am, but I only saw the finished product on 27.12.2006 and was extremely satisfied. I'm not a horror movie fan as such, but I love the old "B" movies and black-and-white sci-fi movies. This movie will make you think if something happens, not then. It will bring you completely out of balance. I would suggest watching the movie first, then the notes and features of the director. It's so well written, staged and filmed and I can tell you personally that working with this cast and crew was a real pleasure. I sincerely hope to be part of the future projects of Brian and Laurence.
