I saw this movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood. Considering that <br /> <br /> can not be shown much on screen at the time [is not that there's much in the novel], the character's obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is the audience very well mediated. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen in love with another person and the other side tried to use him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started in the studio, he began to cry and could not finish more than a few lines, and the whole project was abandoned. It can be said that the novel was written from the heart, and the film is a good <br /> <br /> adaptation of some of it.
