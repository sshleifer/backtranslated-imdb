I read Schneebaum's book (of the same title as this movie) when it was first published, and was deeply touched by his ability to understand the many ways of "being different" (of his own and the people of the Amazon he lived and worked with loved) to see through a way to live a decent life. His subsequent books were not so powerful, but showed his continued search. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was far ahead of his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. This film miraculously conveys both the bizarre and generous nature of man, but also gives an insight into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which in this case is not a morally positive term) that occurs when "civilized" men enter traditional societies penetration. Nevertheless, Snow Tree itself has fallen into a kind of higher innocence, suggesting the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructive power.
