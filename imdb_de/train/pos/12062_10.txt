This movie scares me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother had seen him when he was on TV in '92. I remember being wakened by their weeping wobbles in the middle of the night when my dad helped her up the stairs. She said something like "Do not let her fetch me" or anything like that. I asked her what upset her, and she told me she saw The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> So of course I had to see it and even though I was only eleven, she let me. It scared the shit out of me. I'm immune to horror movies since watching!
