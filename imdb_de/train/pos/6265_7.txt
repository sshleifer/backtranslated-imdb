Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and form a good couple. Nick likes to drink, smoke, and play with people, but Nick suddenly gives up that kind of fun. Sex is the one thing he loves because he wants a child. We find out that an alien race is dying and has to connect with women on Earth to save its people. It is becoming a struggle for survival between humans and foreigners, in which the dog population is also involved. A nice film.
