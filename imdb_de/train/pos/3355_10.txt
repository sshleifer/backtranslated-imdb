May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparing for a historic appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classic victim. A story about loneliness and silence. About the form of life nods and cravings like the form of combat. The Great Character - a book given on a spring afternoon. This film is a poem notable for the arts to describe the shades of shared loneliness. A plea for an unspeakable relationship to reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, the awkwardness of Antonietta, the patience and fragile excitement of Gabriele, the art of the director, which gives the feeling of the scriptwriting grace of two great actors, make this film sublime, a taste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful one Film about hypocrisy and arbitrary judgment on the nature of life and the repulsion of a tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a great intelligent acting. A clear masterpiece.
