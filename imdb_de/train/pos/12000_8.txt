I think the movie is educational. However, it does not address the problem that has sparked so much controversy: plural marriage. Also, the film does not reveal what the LDS Church advocates. A great opportunity has been missed to tell the world what they really believe. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what LDS views are about key issues of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many Latter-day Saint friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view the controversial statements of their Prophet. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would have been nice to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's really interesting life. After all, there is insight into the American religious thought in the 18th century. I hope they make some documentation on this intriguing subject and allow historians to comment on Smith's life. We could one day have a Mormon President. After all, Smith ran for the president.
