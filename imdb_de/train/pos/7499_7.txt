But it's kind of weird, at least if you grew up with Weird Al, just like me. It's a mockumentary about his life and career, from superstardom to origins. It is partly patchy, but some segments are still very funny, especially when it comes to Japan. Although not quite as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he does not find love so fleeting as he is, he captures the utterly bizarre cultural mix of Tokyo's street life. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al is not recognized as an insightful cultural commentator that he is; maybe a rose with another name smelled just as sweet. Nevertheless, this is a funny movie.
