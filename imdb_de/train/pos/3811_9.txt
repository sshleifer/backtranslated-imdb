I have not seen such nice animations for a long time. With good respect for Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other movie they have made is not comparable to it. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the background environment is overwhelming, almost every object in each frame is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I felt a tingling on my back - so much so that I loved what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the animated movie action can be. The characters are adorable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit he owns, pawns, stones and rules! The other characters are also very nice. The humor is first class. <br /> <br /> In general, it seemed that the creators had not put much effort into this. I mean, it looked like it was not too much for the people of Pixar & Dreamworks, who are always trying to think about something new. And I am very glad that a product of the European animation studio turned out to be so great. They made a great touching film, a treat for the eyes and the heart. <br /> <br /> The only minus is the stupid beginning and that's why it's 9 out of 10 instead of 10/10
