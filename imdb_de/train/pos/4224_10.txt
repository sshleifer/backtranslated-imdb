I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is there and she is wonderful as a wonderful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is a delicious sight as the naughty, lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died of a drowning accident. She accuses the husband of her niece, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police left her. I would have loved it if someone other than Mariette played Hartley Veronica. I never like Hartley personally. And with Columbo, of course, there are some laughs when he asks Veronica in a belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a clever joke herself and she goes well with Columbo, who is always played wonderfully by Peter Falk.
