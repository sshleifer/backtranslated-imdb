The only reason I wanted to see that was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. It is not bad, but it is really not very good. The processing is good; The movie is in a good mood. The direction is competent and secure. The story is heavy. The film is played on average by Ledger, Bloom and the usually big Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you come from the US. Just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film I was neither bored nor moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I have to say that I did not care that much. Really, the only reason I can recommend that is that Orlando Bloom shows some kind of allusion to reach (though the "I'm pretty and confused" (prominent gaze) is prominent), so it may be worth the matinee price fangirls. Besides, you just can not see it. It's neither good nor bad enough to be entertaining.
