Okay, this movie is good, as I said, but you have to look at it as worth seeing. It's about two guys, Mac and Sam, who are good friends and work as fashion photographers. Laughter begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) leaves with three stewardesses at the same time and his wife remains suspicious. Sam gets lucky and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks so and starts meeting with stewardesses. There is Garam Masala at every step of the film, songs rock, but something is missing. The comedy has not grown to the point and deserves an award. It's nice, but not so great. Some people laughed until their abdominal pain hurt, but so many laughs did not deserve it. But of course, all opinions are different. So if you want to watch the movie, you are welcome to do so.
