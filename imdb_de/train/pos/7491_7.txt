Years ago, I found a copy of this movie for a dollar or two. In many ways, this is quite fitting, because when it was made in 1933, it was really a cheap-produced film by the "poverty row" studio Majestic. Although the film is rather distracted, it is still worth seeing and offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very familiar, as in some Germanic cities, people are angry because of some people The recent deaths seem to be vampires! Add to this familiarity Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - although he plays a much more harmless spinner. In this case, he is obsessed with his bats and people are beginning to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of providing some "red pegs" (ie, false hints), and while Frye may not necessarily be a genius, the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make VERY different average horror movie. The production had little money to offer, but it still had some of the good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and Universal Studios sets were also used (if filmed for the day). , As a result, the movie looks pretty good overall, although I also thought Fay Wray would be awful as usual - thought it would not affect the movie noticeably. I've seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I've found that her characters have no depth - she always seems to be cast as the "Screaming Lady" and offers little new in every movie. Overall this is great for fans of old horror movies and worth seeing. For people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skippable.
