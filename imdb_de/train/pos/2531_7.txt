Really good horror movie with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa to find an old meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by his radiation. Everything he touches dies and the dark side of Rukh makes him a selfish murderer. His friend Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited solution to the problem and at the same time notes that radiation can be harnessed by curing diseases for the benefit of mankind. The two friends are fighting for the broadcasting possibilities. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
