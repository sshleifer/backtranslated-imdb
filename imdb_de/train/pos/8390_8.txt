My first Cooper was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait while the rolls of film were changed) fit together perfectly. <br /> <br /> Many clich√©s were used in the movie, but Fassbinder presented them so skillfully that I found them really amusing. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes it was louder than a dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved how the post-war period was presented. Real fun! <br /> <br />
