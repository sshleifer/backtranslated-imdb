I just saw an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict, who turned into a drug-addicted life on the street after his cycling career broke up as fast as it started. I have to say that the story of his cycling career was more heartbreaking than his drug addiction. Here's this young man who wins bike races left and right, and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks. Upon his arrival, he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally unfeeling and unkind to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but I wanted to know what was wrong with him to make his act such an ass? Anyway, I was confused about putting together the show because it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see shots of him handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did not know that was legal, but why would a camera crew just follow and film it? Are you doing this in the hope that this guy will turn his life around and give them material for a good TV episode? In any case, it's an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to see, because you can really see how much the families and friends are suffering from the addict's indifference, though I have to admit that it all seems a bit too clean in the end. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn against ruin. Everything has a bit too much happy feeling in the end and I have a feeling that is a very unusual event in real life. But it's still a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about it.
