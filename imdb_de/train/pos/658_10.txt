It's not a simple movie to watch - it's over three and a half hours long and consists entirely of conversations. However, it is so unbelievably convincing and inconsiderate how the human character is to be observed that in my humble opinion it is one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating made around the same time). It shows that the idealism of the late 1960s does not differ from the society he tried to change. <br /> <br /> It is an allegedly exempted ménage-à-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Yet Alexandre is as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as willing submissive and define their femininity through the male look. <br /> <br /> The film is an icy end of the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and profoundly influenced cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the main characters of the New Wave. He played in the influential "Les Quatres Cent Coups" (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well-known as other New Wave directors, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike similar films by John Cassavetes in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is linked to Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, and the person on whom Marie founded her personality also did so. Anger and bitterness culminated in a shattering monologue by Veronika, delivered directly to the audience, breaking off the cold, objective nature of the rest of the film. This intriguing, personal and honest cinematic statement is still one of the most insightful films of human nature.
