I happened to come across this movie and really enjoyed it. Timothy Busfield's character is devoid of redeeming qualities, and at some point Busfield and Star Meloni stretch the women as they pass. Janel Maloney is great ... She looks very similar to Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel actually ACT. Some very nice things in this movie and it's well worth your attention if it's on the wire.
