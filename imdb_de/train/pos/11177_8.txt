***** Spoiler here ***** <br /> <br /> What are you really scared of? Killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a chainsaw with a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears are not even comparable to a horror that people dare not even dare to think about - and that is the death of their own child. "Pet Sematary" taps on that basis, the anxiety of adults, and then leads them to places most could not miss. <br /> <br /> I've read comments on this movie, the bad drama and stupid characters involve decisions, etc. I disagree. The drama is really first-rate for a movie like this one. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair of such a scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, they can be absolutely unavoidable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and humans come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate that he is committed to committing the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite the warning or even the past. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who are ready to go into the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector who is trying to make up for the inability to protect. And the results are scary. If the movie ends up in Slasher territory, it's almost a flop, though I think it's perfectly logical how it got there. I'm a real horror fanatic, and I claim that this is the case is one of the scariest horror films ever made. If you do not believe it, look for children again.
