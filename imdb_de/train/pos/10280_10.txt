House of Games is spelled out. It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect. There are few films that I have seen that can take you so quickly. From the opening scene, this movie will simply pick you up. <br /> <br /> I really try hard not to give too much away to those who have not seen it yet, but there will be a few spoilers that are so little READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW , <br /> <br /> I would say House of Games is not just a great movie, but the best comic film I've ever seen. From the moment the film is over, he asks for a repeat. Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is just perfection. From her manners to the bending of her voice, she instantly gets into the role. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this film has an informal, almost undescribed quality, and these two people communicate in both eyes and voices. I also loved how the movie was filmed in this grainy, surreal way. He was a perfect fit and helped make the movie what it was. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of films I've seen and loved that reminded me to include The Grifters and The usual Suspects, but House of Games is different in its way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most exciting characters I've seen on the big screen, and they not only have strong and tangible screen chemistry from the moment they meet, but also the build-up that starts from the moment in which they see the eyes others are electrifying. You know something is going to happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you guessed the "something", you realize that you did not even scratch the surface. <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those films in a particular genre of film type, but is essentially a film about human nature. The character study is not just about the minds of the cheaters, but about the victim as well. As the movie progresses and we learn more and more about the main characters, we learn not only what they say but also how they say it. It's a great character study and flawless in the way it comes to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would rank this 10 out of 10, call it (though not my absolute favorite movie, pretty high on the list), definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say that it is one of the presents some of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've ever seen. Although I love all kinds and genres of movies when it comes to films of the human psyche, it really does not get much better. Watch this movie.
