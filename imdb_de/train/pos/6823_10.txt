I watched John Cassavete's films last week - from "A Woman Under the Influence" to the "Opening Night". I am totally and totally excited, especially from these two films. From the first minute to the last minute in the "opening night" I was completely and completely excited. I have only experienced it a few times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect has been holding up from about two-thirds to the credits. all about this movie, the way it was shot, the incredible power of Gena Rowlands, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the sense of depth, the tempo, the tenderness, the originality, the characters, the skill little moments .... for me is truly sublime. I can not agree with the previous comment about bringing it to a lonely island, as the sheer depth of this film is something special. If you're unhappy enough to have a house fire, I guarantee that instead of making one final digging attempt to save that cash pool under your bed, instead you'll save your copy of that movie.
