Hopefully, the score has since changed due to my brilliant and stunning review that gets you all looking at the movie and generating an instant refrain of "8," the true score of this movie. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is the King! Before I saw this movie, I was not exaggerating about it, but now I'm knocking on the doors of Chris Rock's website and asking him to take me as his protégé. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this movie funny, you REALLY need a therapy and its humor targets all areas of society, including race (predictable), grading, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand-up comedy , The list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, there was a slight disappointment for me. When I went into this movie, I did not realize that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait," another pretty good movie shot in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised to see this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel and resemble an older movie I saw on TV a few weeks ago. Regardless, this movie is, in my opinion, the better version of the movie Two of them are just because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier every second and every week of the year than Warren Beatty. You get a picture. <br /> <br /> Well, to the actual plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil the experience yourself! Do not read the story! Just watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb that have been annoying. Watch the movie because it's the funniest thing you've seen in a while. Go to a Cinema Experience That does not make you nagging at the expense of movie tickets. Look at it, because it's a good movie!
