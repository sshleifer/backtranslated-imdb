It could have been better if it were led by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great work of art. <br /> <br /> But it's a beautiful movie. I've loved it since local channels showed it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol," but I'm not among them.) I think I've seen "Brighton Rock" many years ago and liked it, but I'm just thinking of the novel.) This is a great cast. Charles Boyer is not Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, careful, caring. Lauren Bacall is a British girl who falls in love with him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a bit Grand Guignol, but I attribute that to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She appears as a precocious teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She is doing her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservation. The caveat, first and foremost, is that it's a bit rigid. But the story and the drama can hardly be improved.
