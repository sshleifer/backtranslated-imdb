Vince Lombardi High School has a new headmaster - the evil woman Togar (Mary Voronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music together. She clashes with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles), who loves the Ramones. Even the headmaster of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) seems to connect with any girl - without realizing that the cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was widely publicized and almost immediately bombarded - but as a midnight movie, it was a huge hit and continued to play in the eighties. I remember that I visited more than a few of them when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughed at each joke and generally just had fun. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I can not imagine why I loved it so much. The script is youthful and full of moans that I could not believe I heard. The characters change randomly and the movie jumps everywhere. What saves this are some really funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who are REALLY having fun). Also everyone is full of energy and plays his roles as exaggerated (as it should). As far as the Ramones are concerned ... I've never been a fan. I like the theme song, but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you could give this a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mainly for kids (it has a PG rating), which will probably find it stupid, but fun. I think especially that they will like the end when high school is blown up! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you fancy a stupid midnight movie from the 80s, you might like it. Otherwise stay away. I give a 7.
