This is simply the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it was just another documentation, but it's really something else. It does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life in nature works. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about the quality of the pictures, since you obviously know from other comments that it is unequaled. <br /> <br /> The earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you regret the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and with what treasure we were blessed, though we do not value it a bit. " br /> This film should be shown compulsory in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you'll ever see. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we see our planet like that ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would appreciate it more if possible.
