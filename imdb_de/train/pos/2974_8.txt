This movie is of excellent tempo, you never have to wait more than a minute for a belly laugh, and it's way more busy than the original premise of the movie. There are mockery everywhere about the traditional, slender natives who are exploited by well-overcoming adversities and whose parodies are. Do not let anyone tell you that he's trying to get cheap laughter by using obscenities - sure, there are a lot of them, but everything is contextual and not in vain. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD for entertainment value, this was the best movie I've seen this year.
