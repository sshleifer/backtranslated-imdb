This is a real eye candy. A world of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to throw cathedrals at their opponents ... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero. Yes, we have heard this song before. But you'll forget that when you look at the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun as long as it lasts. But after you leave the cinema, you are longing for something more history. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year circle? What made the knight crazy? Who built all these amazing monuments, castles and cities ... and why do they fall apart? And aside from this one bunch of farmers, where are the people? This picture really looks so fascinating, but it is not a Lord of the Rings.
