Well, what can I say, this movie has really impressed me, it's not as bad as many say, I really loved it, even if the idea seems so simple and rather boring. I really enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really fits the movie. Second, the simple story, and the drama of Spirit awakens your attention. What I like most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses. This makes the movie more realistic. Not many animations seem realistic, right? Knowing to make animals talk is just so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest animations of the year 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not only to the children :), because it is very relaxing
