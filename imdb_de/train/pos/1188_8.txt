I was initially dubious about this movie (just for the theme), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it worthwhile to look at it. I initially had difficulty distinguishing the two buffalo hunters, but as the movie progressed, they became increasingly different. I'm still being followed by the final scene.
