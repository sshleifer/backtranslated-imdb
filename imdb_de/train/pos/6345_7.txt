The costumes and make-up were great, there were exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey has done as good a job as possible given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure, this was mainly a children's movie, but if you spend so much money on a movie, you should at least give the story enough body to talk about. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth a visit, but lacks the necessary qualities to become a great classic in every way.
