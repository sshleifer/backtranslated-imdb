Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: a "red scarve" film without hysteria, in which the communist menace is none other than the McGuffin who triggers the conspiracy. Pickpocket Richard Widmark frees the easy-going woman Jean Peters from her wallet with a strip of microfilm; Without knowing anything, it holds important secrets for the Cold War. Peters was under the supervision of FBI agents as dissatisfied with the theft as the man who leads them, the cowardly Comsymp Richard Kiley. In an effort to reclaim the precious film, both sides seek the help of Thelma Ritter, an old Street Jane who is always ready to sell what she hears. Fuller draws from an opulent array of tempo and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the time of escalating brutality. From the subways to the waterfront, its midsummer Manhattan gets a sweaty glow that's almost spicy. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of turmoil and tenderness, and they are rated "Again", a song introduced by Ida Lupino in the Road House, in which Widmark also plays the lead role. The tempo slows down for Riter's beautifully written and played death scene - among the most poignant vignettes in Noir and a sort of fataillon oasis in a sentimental film. This is the only work of the writer / director Fuller in the strictest limits of the Noir cycle. His later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld USA) never led to as satisfying a synthesis as Pickup on South Street.
