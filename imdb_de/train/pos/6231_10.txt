This is just a great, funny, beautiful movie. It captures the true essence of the decade and the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this movie may only be in black and white, it is definitely not being tackled today. The main purpose of the film is timeless. This movie features great plays, beautiful song and dance numbers, as well as great design and filming. Follow the Fleet is also weird, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other moments when acting gets you so involved in the plot. It's amazing how this movie can be shot in a certain decade and how it can affect it today. If you want to see something big, look at it.
