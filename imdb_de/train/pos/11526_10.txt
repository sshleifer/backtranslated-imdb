I rented this movie out of a blockbuster on a whim ... I like Alan Arkin and the cover was catching ... I read the back and knew immediately that it would be either the best or the worst movie I've ever seen ... I think I was lucky. I laughed from beginning to end. Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. I have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and have been watching all the time. I've recommended this movie to a lot of people and everyone enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints about the menus and the DVD features ... but it does not take the movie away .. the record was written exculsivley for blockbuster, so they did it do not let you pass the previews. Apart from that, you should use the functions of the DVD to keep you from watching the excellent movie.
