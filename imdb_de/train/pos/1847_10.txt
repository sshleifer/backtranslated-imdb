Whatever you become in your life, you must never forget that you have roots. This is the story of the true facts that has been turned into a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this movie is well underestimated. This shows us a reality of life ... The more evil surrounds you, the better you will become. Trust in your instincts and make sure the ideal of life is to live happily ... without resentment, without living "under a rock". The film concept is more than interesting. It combines storytelling with the events of real life and keeps us aware of everything. From facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about how you live your life!
