It's not bad for a movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie. The best we could be with either Charlie Chan, Moto, the Hawk, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint. In other words, you are experiencing the opportunity to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from simple to urban, to murder and to be murdered - in my book it is always a pleasure. Barrie is a hardened lady who wants to take revenge for her framed and dead father, a policeman who plans and executes a series of attacks from the underworld with her group. What would have had the opposite effect! Sanders is just having fun by dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time and putting the right lighting on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And kills him. <Br /> <br /> The story and the acting are alright, the only criticism I have is, in the end, with the hurried and almost ridiculous discovery of who the evil genius (Waldeman) was - they almost have his Forget relevance in the plot? That is, a solid entry into the series.
