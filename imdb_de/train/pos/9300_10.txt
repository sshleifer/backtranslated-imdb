I do not know much about the Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self-confident. So when I call one of my all-time favorites, it has nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another critic says, Mad Dog Time is symbolism, not realism. It's kafkaesque (too bad that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was as good as Josef K), he's stylish, knowing, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum navigates around a variety of characters, does not try to get shot, and behaves skillfully instead of stupid, trying to keep up with what he knows and not others he can outsmart and who he can not can. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and the side squad looks perfect. The imagery, the attitudes (the only outside shot of Jeff Goldblum going down the stairs seems really weird after so much lounge lizard), the dialogue (style, not expediency is the order of the day), the interaction of Characters do not really gangsterism. To see fun must have been fun. What the critics were up to is really a mystery ...
