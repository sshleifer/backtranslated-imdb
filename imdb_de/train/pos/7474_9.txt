This is one of those films that are hard to verify without revealing the plot. Suffice it to say that there are weird things and unexpected twists, beyond the initial superficial "Tom Cruise tie-up with several women". The quality of the cast raises this film beyond the norm and the cast are well tailored to their parts: Cruise as irritating smug Playboy, who has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as an attractive, but somewhat disturbed lover, Cruz as an exotic new girl and Russell as a fatherly psychologist. The story includes elements of romance, morality, murder mystery, suspense and science fiction, and is generally an entertaining journey. <br /> <br /> I should add that the photography is also consistently outstanding and various visual metaphors are inserted is beautiful, if you know what's going on. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy good-performing movies with twists and turns and are willing to accept a slightly awesome Philip K Dick style resolution, this is a must. <br /> <br /> 9/10
