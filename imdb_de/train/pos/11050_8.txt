Well, magic works mysteriously. This movie about four prisoners escaped by spells and written by another prisoner centuries ago was a great occult thriller with a surprising ending and a lot of suspense. Even if there was a play (almost everything happens in the cell), it never got boring and it was played very well. In the tradition of "Cube," you felt trapped with the characters, and even if they were criminal, you had some sympathy with some of them, just to change your mind through the twists of the story. Some events have surprised you and there has always been a touch of madness in the air. Overall, intense and entertaining and since I expected nothing (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
