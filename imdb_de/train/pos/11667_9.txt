The Secret of Kells is a movie I've been waiting for years after seeing a couple of early recordings at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I am here to tell you that it was worth the wait. The cartoons are highly stylized, but not annoying, as I had feared. The whole movie is a thing of beauty and great imagination. I especially love the animated book in which the little characters on the page are brought to life. The characterization is excellent, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as a stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well executed, a mix of facts and fantasy. and really attracts the viewer to cheer Brendan on his search for the perfect material for the book. I'm a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway, so the topic is close to my heart, but all the people I know, who saw it, and who are not fans of the craft, agree that it's a nice little movie. I'll definitely buy the DVD when it's released, and I want to say, a well-done cartoon saloon and everyone involved in this mammoth project. May there be much more. :) If I come back here to say that I bought several DVD copies as soon as I could, and released them for Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the good luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nomination.
