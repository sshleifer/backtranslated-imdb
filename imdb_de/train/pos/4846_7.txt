This is a classic British comedy thriller that I've always wanted to try, but there's been no opportunity to do so. It is based on a popular play that has been shot several times before (especially in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version does not seem to be completely preserved!); The plot was adapted to the war situation at the time for the remake to be checked. Anyway, I mainly knew the early British comedians in Will Hay's films: given that in this movie a similar plot of legendary ghosts, smugglers, and enemy agents, it's very much in that direction (It was actually written by Hays regular writing team of Marriott Edgar, Val Guest, and JOC Orton); The stranded traveler element was an equally proven formula. The star this time is Arthur Askey (supported by Richard Murdoch) - not one of his films I've seen before - who is unlikely to be a hero like Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as annoying, but you're warming soon and Askey certainly has a series of witty lines and amusing business parts to justify the fact that the main character of the drama (and the 1931 film version) was split in half here, with Murdoch acting as director star's straight partner. <br /> <br /> The remote single shot (most of the movie's events take place during a stormy night) creates a wonderful atmosphere. The last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers), and finally the arrival of the title car itself - is particularly enthralling and well made. Also worth mentioning in the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as a stereotypical, timid spinner whose parrot is her constant companion and driven by all the excitement of having her first drink.
