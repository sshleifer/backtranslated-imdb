One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum Thrillers is that when you get the impression that you've figured it out, it's going in a different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this movie that I have a sore neck from the sight. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can do it. We then hung on to having a good story and in this case (with his brother Rick). <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT to Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest alive even when they play characters, all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and that will keep you interested and advised until the very end.
