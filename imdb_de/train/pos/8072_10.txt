Great and unforgettable, breathtakingly atmospheric and brilliantly played by all. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand what kind of people paste this masterpiece and overcome the weight of 8 (and nine) voices! > <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's biggest movie. I'd say Long Voyage Home is next in line, albeit far behind. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. It deserves a 12.
