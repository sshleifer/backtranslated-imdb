I was attracted to this movie when I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was addicted. We Americans are an idiot for a comeback kid. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a big draw in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate about the reason. Maybe it's the provocative joke that the Lena character makes at the beginning of the film and other social commentary, but perhaps it's the central message that I think attracts everywhere in affluent societies everywhere. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie is the same as the movie Titanic for me. Life is small and as far as anyone knows, that's all we have. It can be taken away at any time. Is not it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls that separate us from other people because we are afraid of being hurt? The tearing of the walls is painful, but the feeling of being alive is on the other side of these wretched walls. Feeling alive is worth the risk. Give and you will receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for lack of characterization and other shortcomings. I say, you are all pseudo-refined. Get people under control, it's a parable, a fable for wealthy Westerners who are materially wealthy but whose souls are in dire poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a choir or band, or help make them less happy than you when building houses or eating food. Spread some joy and make the world a better place as you get out and communicate with your fellow human beings. Writing a check is not enough. Incidentally, we are a social species. Even the smallest of your fellow human beings can influence you in ways you never thought possible. The robust individualism has its place, but is overrated.
