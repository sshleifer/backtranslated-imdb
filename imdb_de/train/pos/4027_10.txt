A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai did their best. <br /> <br /> There's a natural flair in the movie and I felt it through. It looked as if Bollywood had finally given away its glamor and some quality artists appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> The content of the film showed a lot of what exactly happened during the partition, showing the suffering of a particular family and also shows. This trust in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> Best of all, they did not make it a drama with a lot of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
