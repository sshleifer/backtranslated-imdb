Kurt Russell, whose career began when he entered the REAL Elvis in It Happened at the World's Fair, is unlikely to ever surpass his performance as a king in this biopic created by Slash and Shockmaster Carpenter. There are times when you feel like you're watching Elvis until you hear about reality. Maybe memories of a hapless Don Johnson in Elvis and the beauty queen? All appearances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right mix of nerves and hysteria to her portrayal of Momma Presley. Kurt's father Bing plays Elvis 'father Vernon here, and there's a subtle, unobtrusive performance by Robert Gray as Elvis' buddy and Bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> A must for rock'n'roll fans.
