Also in 2008, this film is an audience familiar only with modern overproduced sound and computer aided techniques. The experience of the 1922 cinema-goer, who could only see this in a cinema with others on her big screen, must have been a truly profound and satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One has to wonder if a filmmaker can make a two-hour silent movie today and make it interesting and that can achieve the same structural tempo and balance as this movie. Silent film production was pure art, it had to maintain the attention through its structure, direction and acting - there was no padding with more words or computer generated distractions. A badly made or uninteresting silent movie is unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> This film needs to be contextualized for those who may be irritated by mentioning Christian themes. This is not a 'Christiany' movie, it does not sell anything. These issues relating to current moral standards often occur in this era - even the Sunday running of the church was a national past, Christianity was a matter of course in most households, so the film is just the normal life as it was then , The topics would have been true and deep at this time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange given the good support of the good Christian thinking of this film (and it is not anyone who preaches religion, but only the difference (between hypocrites and honest) that a pastor in 1922 in an open Debate with a representative of the film industry condemning a large amount of Pickford as an example of immorality, along with several other people he named NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have watched this movie, too The pastor complained that the film industry had started since the church was founded. Participation had dropped by 500,000, but the film's representative in the debate made the following Remarks: this salon visit had also declined, there were far more pastors in prison than actors (fact), and the selection of some examples from the many was unrepresented tative for the whole. <br /> <br /> So there was a running process of struggle between church and film industry in the early days of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie about honest and loyal to family friends and the willingness to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, lively, full of happiness and joy, loyal, humorous and quietly self-sacrificing - though poor and uneducated, she was the perfect character. However, this is not crowded in the neck, but gradually revealed by the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese movies, in which the characters are slowly and slowly revealed in the course of a movie, tempo that creates a stronger connection to the character. <br /> <br /> It has a quiet, even pace for the first half, which forms all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are great, and it has to be acknowledged that the sound is without dialogue - this was achieved through skilful action and good direction. It is sometimes surprising to realize that you did not hear a word at the end of the movie, but you feel you have heard everything. <br /> <br /> The understudy did a great job, especially Gloria Hope. Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are typical for Pickford. She goes under the pretext of sweeping the snow, a near-perfect balance and an end. This is a special kind of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin frequently used this device and copied some from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation to be made about silent movies and especially about Pickford movies is that the star often has to hold the camera for most of the film without the device. The audience gets jass or boring that overexposes actors. That Pickford is usually the center of attention in most of her films, but people still do not get enough of her, is proof of her good acting skills.
