In the best outdoor adventure movie of all time, four city people confront the wrath of nature in a survival story. The scenery is backwoods Georgia with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> Director John Boorman chose to portray secondary characters with locals rather than actors. These locals give the film a characteristic that is second to none in film history. No central casting "actor" could ever come close to the remarkable faces, voices, or actions of these people. I can not remember a movie in which the minor characters are so realistic and colorful. Like everything else, it's this grim realism that makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the theme of the film. Nature can be violent in nature. How appropriate that the attitude should be in the American South. Very few places in the US are or were as violent as the country of the male. In a story about Darwin's survival of the fittest, the film expresses the idea that humans are part of nature and not separate from it. <br /> <br /> "Liberation" is essentially a product of its time, as opposed to today, Americans expressed their concerns about a vanishing wilderness. The film's grand backdrop, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the sound of rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, convey an environmental message. And that's another strength of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the entertainment level, the tension gradually increases as the story progresses. Not even in the middle of the film does the tension become extreme and never lose until the credits are reached. Very few films can sustain this intensity over such a long period of time. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is first class. Direction and processing are impeccable. The cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the spectacle is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly staffed and doing a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If the film has a weak link, it's the music that seems shy to me. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Deliverance" will almost certainly appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventures. Even for those who do not, the characterization, the acting and the excitement of the plot are enough reasons to watch this movie, one of the best in cinema history.
