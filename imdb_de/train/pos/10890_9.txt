Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... Wealthy people have done crazy things. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy being entertained, fleeing the pressure of the world for a short time and not taking anything too seriously. This movie fits exactly for this purpose. I rate a movie for its own merit and do not want to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I saw that completely dysfunctional people grew into loving, lovable people who could easily live the street from home. It will stay on my list of "favorites ... who have to pay attention to the holiday season". If you just want to have 90 minutes of fun, look at them.
