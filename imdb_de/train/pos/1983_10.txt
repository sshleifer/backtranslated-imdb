I have recently seen this on a cable channel. The movie is great; It's one of the few musicals I've seen that does not shy away from light and darkness. It shows something of the splendor of this time along with much misery. Some of the set-piece sequences run so much that I did not know where to look next. One day I'll see that on the big screen, just to see what happens. But what really takes this to another level is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a thoroughly mean and threatening man, but there is something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if the Sykes character was on the verge of madness, waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room.
