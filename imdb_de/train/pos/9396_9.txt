In a series of films, Nicholas Cage is seen as a strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a murderer, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp and the late, lamenting J.T. Walsh like gravity. These are the types of roles that these four can play in their sleep, and they've done it often enough to see them playing again, bordering on clich√©. So, what a relief it was that John Dahl, a master who brought a lot of humor out of a little action, directed this nuanced noir thriller. Hopper does not excel, Cage shows a bit more depth than his normally superficial action heroes. Boyle is alternately sultry, innocent and scheming, and you get a feel for the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction conveys a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country in which the story is set, yet intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can handle a radical change in the storyline. The twists of the plot are first-rate, and one of the other major twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually pretend they have a brain. It's not often that smaller characters like deputy sheriffs have more sense than their bosses. But with such an intelligent director as Dahl, you should not be surprised at the intelligence of anything related to this film. An excellent movie.
