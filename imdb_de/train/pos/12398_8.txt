What was always missing in the Matrix story was how things developed in the real world. Do not say more, because this part of the story has covered most of the basics. The really interesting thing was, how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that could be thought of in the fight against the robot horde, which was meant only as a servant of humanity. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We humans tend to fall into this trap many times and let the lack of logic and thought catch up with us because people can not believe the opposite. Well presented and compiled, this is a true proof of how illogical man can be.
