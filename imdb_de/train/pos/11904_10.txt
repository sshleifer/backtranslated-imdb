I gave him a 10, as it seemed to everyone else, and it would have been terrible not to do it. The reason I'm worrying you is to add a personal observation of Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the clever color sequence where everything except the blood is a couple of times in black and white) and "The House On Haunted Hill" several times. <br /> <br /> Even if I'm not old enough to have seen her when Castle has grown to its showman tricks, I can appreciate her for her own merit. And while most spend it as second-rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., I believe they are doing him a disservice. <br /> <br /> The ending sequence of "Homicidal" is really shocking and works today - and it works The premise of "The Tingler" was silly, but highly original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. After this Frank Lloyd Wright house, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, good score and production values ​​- when I saw it for the first time in a packed show in the late sixties, there was an audience reaction I had Never seen it before and never seen it since. <br /> <br /> It was the play where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we're waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall , <br /> <br /> Without a telegraph coming from what comes, the camera slowly pulls back and forces the AUDIENCE to look up ... I say no more (my "spoiler" declaration covers only THIS) Movie off). <br /> <br /> The point is, I think this trick was DELIBERATE - not accidental - and when it happened, the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED (including most) men became!) It took the audience over TEN MINUTES to to calm down. <br /> <br /> Well, that's superior filmmaking. He might have been an extravagant showman, but "House" and the other two movies I mentioned were GOOD MOVIES. Castle might not be a Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's quirks and forget to examine their TALENT. So I hope that this documentary has confirmed that. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
