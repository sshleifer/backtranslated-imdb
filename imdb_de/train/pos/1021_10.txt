The first and second seasons started wobbly, with good episodes between the intermissions and sometimes with clich√© stories. But when it began to build the universe in which it exists and its characters began to evolve, it became much funnier and more entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this show is the episode of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor makes it so much easier to show, Peter's direction is excellent, making each episode so much more entertaining, and Joe and Paul always miss a fun, interesting episode. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, I doubt you do not like the show. For those who want to get on the show, I suggest the episodes "The Other Side," a good serious episode and "Window of Opportunity," a classic comic relief episode.
