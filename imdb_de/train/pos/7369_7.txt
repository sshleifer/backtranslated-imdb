Personally, I could not deal with this is not a love song, it's a brilliant movie and it has a great story. I've just noticed that every two minutes I check the time on my phone to see how much of it is left film. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton because they need each other to get along in life. At the same time, I wish that the relationship was more than what she is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike Ibsen is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. The betrayal in both parts has a big impact on the two men. Both are devastated by the fact that the other ran away and left them at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
