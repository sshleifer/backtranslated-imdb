This movie is called comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. As in any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama that showed the commonality of social injustice and hypocrisy. But it was very funny. much brighter than the director's dark and serious The Circle (my favorite movie in Iran). The ingenuity of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers were both absolutely credible (as if it were a documentary) and totally weird. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the actual match and episodes was amazing. It added a realism, much like the Australian Kenny, of course a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors? Soldiers and girls? were very believable. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Who in this country thinks that Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their own daughters should see this movie? It becomes a true eye opener. <br /> <br /> The soldiers represented the current paradigm for me. They started with official standard answers to all requests of the girls. As the movie progressed, it became increasingly difficult to maintain that attitude. When everything that seems to be like Tehran breaks out into wild celebration, everyone is involved, and the ridiculousness of current politics is obvious to all. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected ending, giving the movie a really nice mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it's an adult movie theater, I think that mature kids from the age of about seven really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that a repressive country like Iran can produce films of such quality from Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints there force the directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a leaf out of their book.
