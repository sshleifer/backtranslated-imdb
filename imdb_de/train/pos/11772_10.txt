In another of Bugs Bunny's bunny-hating crazy shorts, the famous Leporid * works in a department store display case when owner Gildersleeve decides to stuff him. Of course, this is nearly impossible, since Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when he needs to be dressed). As always, they keep everything in full swing, and you have to wonder how funny this cartoon must have been when it debuted for the first time! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a fine example of what the Looney Tunes looked like in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace fans cleaned them. But do not get me wrong, the cartoons were still good after the nifty shapes arrived. Anyway, this is a great one. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and rabbits.
