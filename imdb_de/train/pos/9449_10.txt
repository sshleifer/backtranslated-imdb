I saw this movie early in the morning when I should have slept. This in itself was a testimony that Deliverance was a movie that committed the spells. I think Boorman did a wonderful job directing this movie. How skilfully the early scene was made with the hill tribe and the dueling banjos. It turned out so well and early, as inherently restrained and simple were the people of the area. A typical example: toward the end of the "duel", the banjo-playing boy smiled (he loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel," the boy was too reluctant to answer. The river cruise never let you get bored. The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show what the group had in the backwoods of Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterwards was well done. Some have said that he is rather untouched by the ordeal. I disagree - if you were really paying attention, he did not react during the whole following action, when Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and drove the toothless guy out. It was confusing when Ed later killed the other man on top of the cliff. It almost seemed like the arrow had been shot when Ed rolled it up and expected it to die, but then he realized that the arrow he had shot earlier had finally made an impact. I staggered between 8 and 9 my vote, but after reading a message from an angry voter who gave him a "1", I gave him a "10". The reasoning of this individual seemed to be based more on personal bias than on an objective point of view, and his vote was obviously a non-correlative attempt to lower the rating.
