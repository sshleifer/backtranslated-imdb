This film depicts life in North Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the French colonial government and whose family is one of the few white families in the area. It gives a sense of what life was like for both the colonists and the natives with whom they were associated. It's a feeling that is in line with another film I've seen of Africa in a similar time (Nowhere in Africa (2001)), but I do not know how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - something happens in the movie - but the plot is unremarkable. It is up to the viewer to draw his own conclusions rather than being forced by the filmmakers, though the story's presentation as a review of the woman's visit to southwestern Cameroon as an adult provides perspective.
