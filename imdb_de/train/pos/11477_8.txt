In my opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. It really put things in the right perspective when I watched it. Although it was fictional, this movie is something that could happen to your kids. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred of the school and their plans to murder innocent students. This movie would not have worked in any other format. They took off the handheld camera perfectly. <br /> <br /> It commemorates April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then himself. It also reminds us of the subsequent media tower. Everyone wanted to watch the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We see the kid behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this film is that it did not work well in the market and only a few people know it existed. If there had been a single preview of a single blockbuster movie, everyone would ask Zero Day what the big deal is about. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best filming of a school shooting of the few who have really tried. The filming itself only takes about ten minutes of an hour and a half, since it's mostly about Cal and Andre, and what they've done up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, lend it and look at it. I guarantee you, when you are done, you will be speechless.
