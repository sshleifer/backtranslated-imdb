I love this movie! The animation is great (for a Pokémon movie), the CGI looks so great. I love the music in the movie. So great that they have kept the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for history, it's great. It has a great sense of friendship. Celebi is a very sweet and powerful Pokémon. Ash is really great in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like was Suicune's appearance. He suddenly appears, helps Ash & Co a bit and leaves. They could have made his part in the movie a bit bigger. <br /> <br /> But a great movie overall! I can not wait to own the USA version on DVD!
