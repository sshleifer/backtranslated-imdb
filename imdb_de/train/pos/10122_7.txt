I found this a bit difficult to follow to the extent that it seemed to be in the middle, as I tried to form the head or tail of those who fought against who and why. One of the problems is the cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know very little about, and because we are simply reading English subtitles, some of the subtleties are inevitably lost. Another problem is that it seems too many that only half of the twists and turns are explained. Still, it seems unlikely that there is a completely bad Miiki movie, and certainly not. Many stylish and brutal acts of violence, a window that allows less than orthodox sexual activity, as well as the family aspect. All in all a decent ride, but perhaps it may be helpful to look at the story before you see it.
