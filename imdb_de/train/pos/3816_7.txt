"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. Representing superreligious Korean Christians in a Korean provincial town and the experiences of the main characters who interact with them after a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves with her small son from Seoul to the city of Milyang (in China "Secret Sunshine"). She chose Milyang because her deceased husband (who was killed in a car accident) was born there and she thinks she needs to start a new start in a new place. It does not respond well to the offerings of local Christian zealots, one of whose members is trying to persuade them to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and turns away these people as politely as possible. In fact, it wipes out just about everyone in Milyang from the beginning, but some of them are persistently trying to invade their world, and the consequences are often hilarious. More to say would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is amazing. After reading that she had won the Best Actress Award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to get a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is intriguing and it's impossible to take her eyes off her when she's on the screen. The film is a kind of harrowing Evelyn Waugh-esquire work that shows how Fate can feel as insane as it is insane.
