I really like this movie. I can see it regularly and never get tired. I think that's one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 signs; Everyone has a unique kung fu style that is very secretive and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identity is kept secret. The Dying Master sends the sixth poison, his last disciple, and tries to correct the wrong that some of his disciples have suspected. How will the last student find the other poisons? How should he know which of them is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also see that the poisons fight each other in every combination. It's fun to see how their styles work together. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. It is not better.
