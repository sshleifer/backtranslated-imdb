A beautiful and dark war film, which deals with the inner torment of the blinded Marine Al Schmid. Although it is hard and unpleasant, in the end it is heroic - Schmid triumphs over disability and depression. The fight scene was great. But to pick a bone. No matter how many .50 bullets they fired, I have never seen water or dirt carried away by the impacts! It hurt realism, but I can live with it. Good performance by Eleanor Parker, again as his girlfriend.
