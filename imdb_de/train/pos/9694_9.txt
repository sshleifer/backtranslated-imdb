I was fascinated by this touching and hilarious movie, not to mention the surprise. I was also surprised to learn that Paulie's voice was played by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, neither swaying under the grime nor too hard under the New Jersey Swagger, that I thought this must be some unsung old pro, not Mr. Mohr's baby face. A very impressive performance, and it's gratifying to see his talents taken seriously in a series of whimsical indie films.
