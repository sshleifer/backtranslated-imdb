This Raggedy Ann and Andy movie is so adorable. We love to see Ann and Andy singing and dancing, along with the camel with the wrinkled knees. This movie has made the camel with crumpled knees so popular that he sings his song "I am Nobodies I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you'll see why it's a movie kids love and adults!
