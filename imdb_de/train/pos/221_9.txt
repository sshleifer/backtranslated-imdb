I remember that I originally saw this movie in Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I did not really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau earned the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing given that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first-class. ("Do you know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when he spoke to the Spanish-speaking man at the reception, "No, no, no, no enchilada !!") Absolutely funny! <br /> <br Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played in front of Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was on DVD because my VHS recording is getting a bit old. <br /> <br /> I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen because it definitely can not match the original.
