It is tempting to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as an "event of thought" modeled after Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal plot is a certain Bart Klever's tormenting search for that short-lived substance that constitutes the essence of the personality. The script for his new movie takes shape on his computer and in his own imagination. This film monologue was written in response to Fellini's "8 Â½" and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. It plays excitedly with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience and reveals the strange connection between reality and the imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: von Guttenberg and MacLhuen. We've been tempted for some time to stand by the scriptwriter, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the bloody stereotypes of mass mentality ("man," "Catholic," "window cleaner"). And together with him we fall into a trap when the author and author is finally confronted with the insoluble dilemma: how to remove him from the future film? Bart Klever? Only five minutes before the finale, thanks to the usual small reproaches of the Creator's wife, who has sunk deep into the work, we find that we have been "framed" along with the main character. What is the price of art, for which it is acceptable to renounce the own name and the daily care of the little daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this beard? Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone who, like Frenhoffer, is obsessed with Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter, the scriptwriter at the end erases from computer memory what has written everything)? Gert de Graaff suggests answering this question yourself. <br /> <br />
