It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will happily end up like most other American movies, and then be amazed if it does not. I like a happy ending as much as the next, but sometimes it's better to make things more realistic, and I thought Brokedown Palace did that very well. <br /> <br /> The end, basically with a friend It was very moving to sacrifice oneself for the other, thus compensating for her earlier bad behavior that brought her into the situation. I could have got along without the last line, which proved that she did not actually do the act she confessed, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls rather than the crime. Whether she did or not was not that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself was a clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention with their outstanding performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points.
