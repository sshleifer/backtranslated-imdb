This movie is an excellent military movie. It's not an excellent Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that's not the case with this movie. Other reviewers found this movie too slow for their liking, but ?? as a retired soldier? I appreciate the speed with which the film crew intentionally told their story as fully as possible, given two hours and nine minutes. The story itself was narrated and repeated several times, but it remains for a professional soldier. and an African American? to tell the story of how the film crew presents it and how it introduces the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work as a Navy Diver and his life as a Navy Diver after graduation is not the only story to be presented. There, I also related how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday disagreed with his chief officer's illegal order that the Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear fail in his test dive, no matter how well he did, and pay the price for a Stripe loss a change of assignment. It also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic off the Spanish coast in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was in the line of torn tether that he would have torn in two if Brashear had not pushed him out of the way and taken the shot himself. This was a complex story worth telling, and I have to admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew Endeavored to tell a story as fully as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to have so grandly told such a great story and to see the traditions and honor of the Navy so naturally and completely preserved.
