This is definitely one of the best Disney movies ever made. It is a real treat for everyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will get you in suspense. <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is basically about having three pets on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on and desperately want to go home, escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last movies that shows Don Ameche starring. He gave the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly Golden Retriever. In this movie, Sally Field also played the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Expressed by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor of all time), Chance is basically everything you expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and dumb, and every time I watch this movie, it's a coincidence; it's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes very sad too. It sometimes reminds people of the times when they were alone or when they lose their pets. One scene that always keeps my spirits up is the scene in which the trio tries to escape the pound; I am particularly shocked by the part where Chance lets his collar hang in the fence and almost does not make it. The film had other exciting moments, but no one seems more exciting than this. Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you will probably enjoy the sequel as well. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 points!
