This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey did not have his usual face in this movie. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter called Bruce Nolan. Nolan accuses God (Morgan Freeman) of everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said, Carrey did an excellent job. I also found that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great at supporting actors / actors. The plot was good because it had many subheadings in the main point. This movie can be both funny (Bruce's dog) and sad (the "break"). The script worked well too. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie at 9/10.
