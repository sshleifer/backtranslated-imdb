Netflix should mention this short feature in the info for Silk Stockings. Superior in every way to overproduced fluff. This had much better Cole Porter songs and much more energy. Silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred got too old for these things, though the dances and Cyd are lovely. I'll be on guard for the Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre in the production of silk stockings sick - he seems to be very passive with more active numbers and fewer lines? Very glad that I met Paree - Paree by chance. The whole experience became much more pleasant. Bob Hope is a pure "song and dance man" pure joy.
