A stupid young man is possessed by a woman - so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. An evil sorcerer comes to him and informs him that he can give him a great fortune to win the lady's heart IF he agrees to give him everything he wants in his room , The fool agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection from the mirror - and as a result, bad things happen, of course. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been made just a decade later, I would not be sure. It was not so charitable to review and rate this film. After all, the plot of the film in the places is a bit vague and the acting is sometimes a bit stilted. Considering that 1913 "full-length" movies were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! Besides, the idea of ​​a complex story, as you get it in this movie, is very unusual - because the stories were played very short and wide. Given the time limitations, this movie is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films.
