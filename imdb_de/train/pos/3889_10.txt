Eddie Izzard is nothing less than a comedic genius, and Eddie is at his best. His material is extremely funny and hilarious, and his delivery is among the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the intelligence of the audience, he relies on it to draw humor from his clothing preferences, Hitler, the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs one can not help repeating some of his lines. More and more: "Do you have a flag?" should be considered as one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every fan of first-class stand-up comedy has to see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard fought for success on the live stage. His lack of commercial success in the film, however, should not indicate how talented he really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure that fortunately has found its way to the home video and can and should be enjoyed time and time again.
