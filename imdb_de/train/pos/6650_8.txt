I do not want to comment on how good the movie was or what the shortcomings were because I am not a professional film critic and do not have sufficient filmmaking skills. What I know is that it's a great achievement to make that kind of film in your very first shot, and I want to congratulate the director on that. However, in some of the reviews I read, critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely deleted from the story. Now, I really want to address a point here that, as the movie name says, is not a film about Hiralal's brothers, but a film about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less. If we start complaining that some characters in the movie are being disabled, it would be a bit unfair, as these characters do not fit into the picture, no matter how relevant they were in real life. I think it would be better if we stick to the basic idea and stop satisfying a critic within us. <br /> <br /> Have fun !!!!
