After watching the A Perfect Spy miniseries in one go, all you have to do is take off your hat - a pure masterpiece that has quite different qualities than Smile's other Le Carré minis. <br /> <br /> In the minis about Smiley, it's Alex Guiness's how Smiley steals the show - the rest of the actors only support him, you can say. <br /> <br /> Ensemble and history are important here The leading actor Peter Egan played brilliantly in recent episodes is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan only plays a man named Magnus Pym, who is beloved by all, big and small, by his lies, cunning and what he likes to hear. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> The machine behind a spy and / or traitor was never better said! After we have followed his life from a very young age, we fully know what makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything makes him a "perfect spy", as his Czech handler calls him. <br /> <br /> And as we follow his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to reach the straight and narrow path once you have left it. He stumbles on, though he never gets anything out of the blue, except for being promoted by his MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy as long as the flow of fake information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a no-good-con-man who always dreams up to free people from their money. In later years, his son has to rescue him again and again. Through the example of his father and uncle, who acts as guardian, when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent to asylum, Magnus quickly learns that lying is the way of survival rather than the truth. At first he exaggerates it a bit, but quickly learns to tell the right lies and be consistent, never changing the stories from time to time, telling them to those who want to hear about himself and his father. <br /> <br His Czech handler Alex, who is expertly played by Rüdiger Weigang, uses Magnus to build up a network of non-existent informants who provide British MI5 with fake information for years, just like the British did with the German spies who were working in the UK before and during the war - they kept sending fake information to the homeland, long after the agents themselves were evicted, liquidated, or simply replaced by MI5 men. Young boys playing Magnus at a younger age. Do this wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, slightly cynical and tired Pym, played by Egan. But you easily buy the difference, as it is often the way we change our lives, from enthusiasm to grief or indifference. <br /> <br /> Actually worth the money!
