As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes for a solid outing. Dennis Quaid, the most judicious jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect when the science teacher became baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never dumbed down for the kids, as one would expect from a G-rated movie. As a sports movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Any Given Sunday.
