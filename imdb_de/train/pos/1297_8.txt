Faithful adaptation of a witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed software developer of middle age (or so), which relies heavily on the first-person narrative, but not bad either. Downbeat (in a petty-bourgeois way), philosophical and black humorous, I could best describe both the movie and the novel because he is something of a rather intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disregard for the intended CB). An extremely funny, but also dismal, analysis of social and sexual relationships. The great achievement of the film is that it so clearly reflects the real life that you are asked: Why are not other films like that? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
