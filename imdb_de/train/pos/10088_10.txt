Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an early Peter Finch as squire on a godforsaken plantation, where there is always a danger that elephants or crazy Englishmen will stay out in the midday sun and get mad. Well, after course, after the typhus or cholera outbreak, of course, and there is too much chaos. Taylor replaced a sick Vivien Leigh in this cauldron / adventure strip. If the elephants storm the house and catch Liz on the big stairs, I still get goose bumps. Luckily, Dana Andrews saves the day. One of my most guilty favorite pleasures. Also in color!
