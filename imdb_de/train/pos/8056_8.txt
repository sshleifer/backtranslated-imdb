This image in 1935 was continued with all sorts of Ocars as Best Director John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines" (42), did a great job as an Irish rebel who was one tough and tough group, all fighting for one thing while getting poorer with a lot of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a terrible mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend to travel to America with his wife and live a new life. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary" (43), played a great supporting role as leader of the Irish Rebellion and wanted to capture the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan is persecuted by his betrayal of his friend and feels like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful drama by McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the movie.
