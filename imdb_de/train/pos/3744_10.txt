This may be the best short drama I've ever seen. The acting is outstanding, especially Amanda Burton, whose character is from creepy to sweet and disconcerting to sad and then some ... She does a great job balancing Rachel's / Carla's feelings and the pain of someone who's lost a child has expressed, it is so believable it feels more like a real life story than a drama. Of course, the other actors are also great, which is what they are usually on British television / film. The end that I will not reveal is fantastic, especially because you do not really get one ... (you get what I mean after you've seen it). It pays to buy it and see it over and over again and if you are not touched by it, you are a cold-hearted person.
