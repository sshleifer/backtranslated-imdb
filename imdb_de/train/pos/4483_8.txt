Everything that should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) does not miss a step and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) does not notice. Scenes with them are very good and show how much talent can contribute to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's "I fall in love too easily" is an indication of his future and future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is adorable. Kelly earned his nomination for Best Actor. And there's a bushel of really funny lines like: "Do you think the Navy will take dope?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; and: "We got a bit of trouble, we took a small child with us." A thoroughly enjoyable film, just the thing to shake off the dust of a recent World War II.
