I saw this movie when I was almost a very small child and of course was moved to tears by this story of a fox family. The fantastic scenery of Hokkaid√¥, the excellent storytelling and not least the wonderful soundtrack convey a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers it may be useful to know that only the DEFA synchronization pays off. I have both recorded (DEFA and BR), but I always only see the first one.
