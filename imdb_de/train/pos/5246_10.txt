This movie deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as a Playboy experiences. While I found the world morally repugnant, the movie was best at storytelling and that leads us through an experience we would never otherwise do. Tim Meadows portrayed Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story dragged me into the reckless world of Leon so that for a moment I forgot that I was watching a parody of the Playboy world, and felt compelled to rebel against it. Therein lies the downfall of the film, for its great and bold storytelling performance goes hand in hand with its own success. I understand that the vast majority of moviegoers will only respond to the surface story of this movie and reject that story. I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved them. I loved it not only for its intriguing insights into the playboy's deceived mind, not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive, but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what lies in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
