An exciting drama written by William Mastrosimone after his stage play in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie in her car attacked by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to escape, but the police inform her that they can do nothing. She realizes, however, that Joe got her wallet and knows where she lives. When their roommates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) work, Joe visits them to finish what he started. After humiliating and demoting her in various ways, Joe has a chance to beat him back and detain him. She knows for certain that she is in a different situation of "his word against yours" and that technically no rape has taken place. She has no intention of making it easy for him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what he intended to do. <br /> <br /> The movie is ultimately a showdown between its two opponents. Later, Marjorie shows such recklessness that one has to wonder if she has not gotten out of hand like her nemesis. Fawcett does enough work while Russo is really the spoiled thug doing his best to manipulate the situation. With just two characters on screen, the movie remains intimate for much of the runtime, suggesting it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the uglier and exploitative elements of the situation; The movie sometimes gets uncomfortable. And when Marjorie gets the upper hand, things change enough that it's not so easy to encourage them to seek blood, and it's hoped that Pat can get them to see the reason. <br /> <br /> Extremities, "I felt, was a pretty good movie that at least kept up the interest and a pretty high intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both good at support (Scarwid has a great moment in which Terry reveals himself as a rape victim), and the tempo is constant, admittedly, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material convinces every step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
