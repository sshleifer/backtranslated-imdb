That's a great game! Okay, maybe it did not have the features you wanted, but Digital Anvil has still thought up a good game. There is some resemblance to Elite (you can trade, collect weapons and cargo from destroyed ships and complete missions), but this game offers a heavily scripted mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! Basically you fly your spaceship around a system and work your way up! The game offers some good graphics, even though it was created in 2003. It should also run well on a modest PC. The story contains some great voice rolls by John Rhys Davies, George Takei and Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stay with the story, it keeps getting better and better. There is even a racing section in which you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course (you have to drive through rings). This section took a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active fashion scene on the net. Take a few mods to expand the game. I have not played any mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a continuation of it was canceled, too bad!
