One of the first OVAs ("original video animation") I've ever bought is still one of my favorite tracks. A cyberpunk science fiction action comedy against an unlikely background (for a comedy) in a dystopian society. The "heroes" of Dominion are the tank police with the philosophy "If we can not defeat crime, we will become bigger weapons" and who, as the name implies, patrols the city in tanks rather than patrol cars, which are actually far more dangerous are trying to catch as all the other criminals. Most, if not all, of these cops are border psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the term "loose cannon". Equally colorful and amusing are their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his Hench (where) men, the twin cat sisters, whose existence always means giving the tank police a hard time. <br /> <br /> The animation is not state of the art, but otherwise it is very nice; The colorful and caricature look of the characters and the Mecha goes well with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> The English dubbing is a lot of fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they've ever made a soundtrack album of it ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It's a Japanese cyberpunk SF with a lot of comedy filled with overly exaggerated characters and situations that make sure it never gets serious. Highly recommended.
