I saw this pilot when he was shown for the first time, and I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans hate him because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., he took the character in the direction of "Camp". But apparently I never got enough of Batman because I thought it was entertaining, in a way like this show. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner was mortally wounded and he makes a dramatic speech about how he has always stood up for the law and obeyed the letter. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" This is his way of telling Denny that he should become Vigilante instead, which he does (although he is on TV Batman). Then there's the scene where he tries to trick the villainy into letting him go with a kiss, but she's not fooled because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of "camp," which was "underplayed" by both the actor and the actress.
