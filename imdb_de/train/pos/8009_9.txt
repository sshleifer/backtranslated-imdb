Ah, true memories. I lived in Holland at that time and was looking forward to it every Sunday evening and later on Tuesday. I saw it in my 14-16s. Very good for my (currently school) English, as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages, with the exception of children's programs nowadays. So you would hear the original voices and the language. - The best series were the top three, and after the third series, the great character Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the show (I do not think they ever really caught him, he always fled and left room for him to reappear in a next story), because obviously the series was also distributed in Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not come across very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone has so wonderfully convinced the intelligent Nazi aristocrat who had this constant obsession to avenge himself on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high-quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good opponent and the teens were so normal. They were very credible to me at that time, and as a kid I could easily imagine being part of those young people who were about four years older then me. It was a very exciting series for me, which I remembered as a special show with "The Prisoner". I hope they will release a good DVD of the series, that would be wonderful. Even the bad copies are still pleasing to look at. The later series were not so good, watered down and just not as fun as the first three. Hopefully you will also find the other series with Von Gelb on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
