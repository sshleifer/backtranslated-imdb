Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not know it was on this page until I checked a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I enjoyed every minute. During the shoot they needed me in two places at the same time, so they used my twin sister as Body Double! The finger pressing the radio button in the car is not mine. I still play and watch TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first at the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was okay, but if I was not there, it would not be one of my favorites. I really liked the acting, but the story was just so-so.
