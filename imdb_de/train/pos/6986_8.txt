If you are looking for UFO facts, this video is very important. The "meat" of the video are the comments of Buzz Aldrin. He is without doubt from the best countries in America. Objectively, honestly and objectively trained in his reports. Many American astronauts from all eras have reported some kind of contact or UFO observation and there are videos of some of these missions. At least something happened that requires further objective investigation. I think this Buzz Aldrin testimony shows that it is possible that other worlds are interested in our progress. Like any supposed documentary video, this video may be weird, but contains more information and opinions from a savvy American hero. They do not come every day. The fact that some people are not interested in details should not distract you from watching this video. At least it's interesting and I recommend you to be open-minded.
