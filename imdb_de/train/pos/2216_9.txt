Historical drama and history of growing up, involving free people of color in New Orleans before the Civil War. Begins slowly, but picks up speed as soon as you get to know the main characters and begin the actual action. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. They may not have all white rights, but they certainly had more control over their fates than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must decide for themselves how to live, whether to immerse themselves in the corruption of the system or to live with optimism and contribute to their fellowship. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
