This game is incredible. Really, you should get it if you do not have it. Although it is now ancient, it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or something. When I was young, my friend and I sat for hours playing this game, trying to beat it, which we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a Mario fan, that's essential. It's fun, entertaining and challenging. Everything you could ask for a fantasy game, except good graphics (well, it came out in 1996). Nintendo is the best!
