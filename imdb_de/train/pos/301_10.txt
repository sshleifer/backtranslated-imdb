'They All Laughed' is a great Peter Bogdanovich who finally gets the recognition he deserves, and why? There are many reasons why New York really sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star of Ben Gazzara and the late John Ritter. And without Audrey Hepburn, no classic is self-evident. The film is a light and airy romantic comedy that is very much about the screwball comedy of the thirties. Essentially, the film is about the Odyssey detective agency run by Gazzara, who quit smoking and skating eccentrics Blaine Novak (film producer) and John Ritter with his detective colleagues, basically, Gazzara falls in love with the wife of a wealthy tycoon magnate ( Hepburn) and Ritter in the beautiful Dorothy Stratten, who sadly murdered after the production after her death: "They All Laughed" is indispensable for Bogdanovich fans.
