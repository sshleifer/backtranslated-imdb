There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew of the auxiliary ship that he does not dream of. <br /> <br /> As Doctor Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition to the planet 20 years earlier. Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people on this planet who were once the homeworld of an ancient civilization known as Krell. The records decrypted by Pidgeon indicate that Krell came to a catastrophic end of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind still works. <br /> <br /> They may work too well if auxiliary members die and die in a particularly cruel manner. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about a remake, and this is a movie that should not be redone because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. The conditions would change, we would now say, warp speed instead of hyper-drive, thanks to the continued popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We could not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like a space ship. It could look much more like the Starship Enterprise or the 2001 A Space Odyssey Ship. It's interesting to watch sci-fi movies from different generations and see how ideas about the future change. <br /> <br /> The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless tale of mortal beings trying to play god /> <br /> You can not write about the forbidden planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical miracle, compiled by Pidgeon with the knowledge he had acquired through the study of Krell, was a hit at the time. He revived himself in the sixties with the character of the Lost In Space robot. His scenes with Earl Holliman playing the cook on the spaceship and his following Earl's request for some ghosts are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar but lost the Ten Commandments and Farewell to the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's bad luck against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. Classics among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic overhaul of Tempest, which, if you think about it, could be Shakespeare's venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite actor is Warren Stevens, whose victim Leslie Nielsen allows him to see exactly what he's dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this when it airs.
