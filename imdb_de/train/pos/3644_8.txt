The Rookie is based on the true story of an over 40-year-old schoolteacher in Big Lake, Texas, who reached the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a high school teacher and baseball coach in a small town. His team is losing terribly until the team finds out that the coach has played in smaller leagues and can throw a 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After throwing the bats and making a bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins regional teams, he'll try it for the major leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy as a boy until his first game in the majors. It's a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worthwhile, he gives an emotional performance and is supported by a stellar cast that includes Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for the story to develop, and some scenes are a bit slow, but everything works well until the end. The baseball scenes are funny, well filmed and presented excellently. The movie is not about baseball, it's about a man's search for his dream. It's inspirational, emotional and funny. I like it, I hope you do it. <br /> <br /> The rookie. Performers: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br/> 4 of 5 stars.
