"Footlight Parade" is just one of several wonderfully cheerful musicals Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to ward off the Depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced at this time, and they literally made millions of Americans forget their problems for a while and enjoy themselves. The great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances to the most original dance styles, his arms are usually lowered at his side and his legs perform all kinds of wave movements and kicks. It's easy to see that he enjoys himself, and that makes us all the more fun. <br /> <br /> Although almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the movie, it's well worth the wait. I think this movie was made just before the production code was installed, so some costumes and scenes are a bit risky. But it's fun. <br /> <br /> It does not matter what the plot of the movie is, you just have to know that there are lots of laughs and a great cast. Apart from the ones already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is best here. 7 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
