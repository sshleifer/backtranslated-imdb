This is a generally nice movie with a good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weak points of the film is the annoying sequence of sequences copied by Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try something original, Abbas? Mustan Anyone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya can not imagine an accident she sustained during the previous pregnancy, and she eventually chooses a surrogate mother to carry her child. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute, played by Preity Zinta. The movie is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to record it? And even if they choose a girl, does the man have to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? I think if the authors had heard of all this, the film would not have been made, so the concept is obviously intentional. Salman works very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. However, his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is for him to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is okay right now; It is generally effective and tries to do something with the role, but is completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show with her flawless performance. She turns easily and naturally from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman. She lives the movie, emotes and lets you love and at the same time admire her, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her best achievements. She is undoubtedly more talented than her industrial contemporaries. She should just do more of those roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the film highlights only what I said above. It's jerky, exciting and played very well. See it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for the price!
