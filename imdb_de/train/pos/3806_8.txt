This film has taken my breath away in some places, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the character dialogues and the storyline could have been a little better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story of some guys trying to kill a dragon ! <br /> <br /> The overall design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes ... it's all magical! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this movie. Character designs were great and funny. A little Tim Burton-ish, if you like. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in great design and is shown in a simple little but beautiful story.
