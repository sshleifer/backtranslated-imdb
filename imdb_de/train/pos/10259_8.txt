A lot of people are unfairly participating in this series, but some of the Guinea Pig videos are pretty entertaining. In particular, the Devil's experiment, there are some fantastic effects - not just the infamous Augapfelszene, but also a very realistic skin incision at the base and breaking with a sledgehammer hands are very realistic - particularly for the year and the low-budget video. <br /> <br /> Let me start now for those who do not know: This movie is an "extreme" torture / fake snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-80s. The plot is as simple as it is: A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her break is. This brings with it brutal violence - all effectively realistic effects, including the one mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as painful-looking hot oil on the arm of the trapped girl and placing maggots in the subsequent flaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing punching session in which three men take turns beating the girl's head while her head falls down, and a second sequence in which the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and affect the realism of the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is pretty convincing in pain and needs a lot of abuse and rough stuff in front of the camera. Her reactions, while strapping headphones to her head and making loud noises for hours, are frightening. Part of other abuse she suffers is that it is ranked only in a network of a tree as she gets a break. There is also a disturbing scene in which the giggling conquerors be rotated through her belly and another disgusting dismal scene through an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she pukes. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series. I hope I helped you decide if you want to give this episode a chance or not. 8.5 / 10 for Devil's experiment.
