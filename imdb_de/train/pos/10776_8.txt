"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by the Italian singer-songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes the music score. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of the northern Italian province in the Emilia Romagna region. In 1975 we are the time of the first free radios - one of the guys of the movie creates "Radioraptus". Youth wishes, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the topics, but the film also talks about drugs. - The main character "Freccia" is a victim of heroin slavery and moralist, the story flows very well; The spontaneity of the actors is strong and also the direction. Of course Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither a Fellini nor a film pro, above all he is a musician. However, he succeeds in producing a good product. Unfortunately he will not repeat the success with his second movie "Da zero a dieci" - not good. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" actors are generally not very famous, the only star being Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. In a small role, see another Italian songwriter -Francesco Guccini, he is the nice communist barman and football coach!
