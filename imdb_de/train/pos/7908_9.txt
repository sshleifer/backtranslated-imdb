I recently found a copy for $ 5 in a video store and eagerly picked it up. While music and (obviously) graphics do not meet the standards of my favorite Beyond the Mind's Eye series, I'm still excited about one segment: Stanley and Stella in Breaking the Ice. The music is brilliant and the emotions feel real. Unfortunately, the clip on Odyssey's website has neither the story nor the music.
