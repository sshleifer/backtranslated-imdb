Part of the enjoyment I got from this movie was the fact that I did not know anything about it other than starring John Turturro and Emily Watson (two reasons enough to look at him). Everything that developed before me was completely unexpected. So I will not give away much more. Suffice to say that Turturro is great as an eccentric, obsessive, and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and Em gradually adapts him as a strong-minded woman who is attracted to him. It's about love and obsession, not about the revered board game, and after I got involved bit by bit in the first half hour, it became absolutely convincing. And I challenge everyone to guess the end.
