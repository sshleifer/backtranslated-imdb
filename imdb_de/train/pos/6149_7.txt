I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with affection since my childhood. He is certainly meant for a curious afternoon. Bedknobs is definitely more meaningful in its full form, the deleted scenes (especially those associated with McDowall) are pretty neat. A little worrying is how the scenes were remastered. Obviously, the soundtrack of this footage had been lost or damaged. Therefore, a bright spark at Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogues. Which would have been great except that half of the cast was not around (some for better reasons than others), and the overall quality is rather modest. Some of the lip syncs are pretty meager, and David Tomlinson's voice was dubbed by a guy who does not sound like David Tomlinson at all. However, it's good to hear the full versions of all songs (though "step in the right direction" is still missing) and the moments of magic in this movie shine through. And I urge you not to giggle when the young Paul looks at Angela Lansbury and Coos so innocently. "But what does that have to do with my button?"
