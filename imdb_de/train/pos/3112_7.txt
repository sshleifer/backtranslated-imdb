I watched Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before I saw it in the theater. I had waited for it before they started shooting. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Minor spoiler down- <br /> <br /> Overall, it was good, but also lacking the continuity of the first two. Identity and superiority cruelly flowed between the adrenaline rush and the introspective drama. This movie sometimes felt choppy. The downtime of the property was a bit too lengthy. This has meant that the following action was too frenetic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of Frenetic, the striking greengrass camera was present and very annoying to me. I know the nausea has been talked about in the forum, but it does not mean it's not relevant. The entire martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted. The ridiculous camera cuts and shaking camera have ruined most of the fights in the movie. It's a cheap student-director-trick that makes the movie seem confused. I would expect these techniques to be used in a horror movie for high school students, but not in this classic, adult action series. Too much extreme close-ups. Do some framing. Get interesting shots. The constant close-up feels like I'm too lazy. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was very confusing at first. They raise new names and faces from the beginning. Made me feel like you're getting into a movie too late and knowing you've missed important information. Felt crashed or compressed due to time constraints. After catching up, however, the story is pretty good. It's fun to follow along with Bourne Leads. HOWEVER, I was NOT interested in seeing the final scene of Supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) in the midst of the ultimatum. Basically, the movie is half a prequel. I found that uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: The star of the movie is the action. Obviously, there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Collaboration was kind of strange to me. I think they only wanted to protect Bourne and confide in it. If I did not miss something completely, they will never tell you why they got together. The other killers in the movie were pretty quiet. That felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / Who does not want to stay open. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as uninteresting as Castel (the first guy Bourne fights in identity). The cast in general has deteriorated over the course of the series. Clive Owen was practically an afterthought. That's a measure of strength for the first cast. The second, they basically trade Chris Cooper for Joan Allen ... Not right now. This exchanges Brian Cox and Franka Potente for three later named actor. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but those are not the first names that come to mind for this type of series. Apart from a few breaks that looked too long, the spectacle was right. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was successful. I felt like they wanted to get the series over with. If they had trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, completely removed the part of Scott Glenn, zoomed out, and taken the camera away from the victim of the seizure, that would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not understand why they leave Bourne alive at the end. In my understanding, this was the conclusion. They clearly pointed to the beginning of the series, with his silhouette hovering motionless. I thought that would be it. An endless kind of end. However, I liked it when Nicky responded to the news story. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFICATIONS WARNING - MOVIE BELOW OFFER - <br /> <br /> Bournes last line at the end "Look at what they are getting you to give." I have the first one Assassin, whom he killed. The last scene was great. (Except that Vosen Strathairn) shot at Bourne. Why should he do that? Only in revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxed his top secret file? Make sense.)
