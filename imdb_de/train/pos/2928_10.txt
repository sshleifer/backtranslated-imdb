EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is by far the funniest stand-up concert movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have breaks at some point, but not these. For 90 minutes there is no moment that is not funny. From the moment Eddie makes a weird impression of Mr.T, the laughter are uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this was done in 1983 and Eddie did almost nothing funny. It's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS that was not funny at all. Eddie, when you're out there, please go back and do a concert movie in the style of DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know that.
