This is not a movie you see for entertainment, at least most people I know they are not. <br /> <br /> It's the portrayals of cruelty to the mind and body that are pretty good in a war because you read "their thoughts," more frequently in books and rarely in movies, but in this piece very well done. I would place it next to "Keep Calm on the Western Front" and "The Bridge" to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could show it along with the other two films at school - finding a copy of it turned out to be rather difficult - which is a pity.
