I liked this movie very much. The premise is quite imaginative, and as a spectator, I got carried away as the characters evolved. The tempo is very well done for those who like to think - enough is withheld from the viewer at an early stage, and there are always questions that will be answered later and produce a thoughtful and very satisfying film, both cerebral and action , <br /> <br /> It seems that some people have been looking for an uninterrupted roller coaster ride - one that comes out of the gate. This would be more akin to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill - a wonderful feeling of anticipation - and ultimately, in my opinion, more fulfilling for the original foundation laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
