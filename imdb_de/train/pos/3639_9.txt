This movie is about family for me. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but also for his family. I can not tell you how I could tell my little girl that Daddy went to Kansas City to talk about Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs. She would think that it was the coolest, just like Morris' son. Dreaming to live with the family, that's what it's all about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
