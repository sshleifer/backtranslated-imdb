<br /> <br /> If you're interested in pirates, pirate movies, 19th-century New Orleans or Yul Brynner, check out this movie for yourself. Do not be put off by various lackluster reviews. My response was that it is entertaining, (mostly) well traded, has a very witty dialogue, and does an excellent job of portraying the charm, allure, and legendary fascination of privateer Jean Lafitte. Although not all the events of the film are historically correct (can you show me a historical film that does that?), I think that the movie played the role that Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans, and the love I hate the relationship between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the movie does not do, but pay attention to what it does, d. H. To study one of the most fascinating historical figures of New Orleans and America.
