My super-ex-girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I really expected a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie had so many wonderful laughs and a funny action that everyone could get. I know this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just cool and Steve was a great addition, along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun, and that made the movie really good. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, that's my best friend's name) is not the typical woman who sees a librarian. If Matt, your average man, asks her, is he for more than expected, he asks G-Girl out on a date, the superhero of the world! When he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is, she decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time, but Jenny will not have it because he falls in love with another girl, Hannah, and she'll make it. His life is hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not have picked a better girl to break up with. <br /> <br /> The effect was crazy, but you are seriously moving past them, the story and the cast really made the story work, and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step by Prime , My super-ex-girlfriend is a funny movie that you should not really take seriously. It's just a sweet romantic comedy that I think I could laugh at, anyone could do that. <br /> <br /> 7/10
