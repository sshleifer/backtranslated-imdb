It is a rare opportunity if I want to see a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is such a movie. In old cinemas I would have stayed for further performances. Was this story autobiographical for the author / director? It has the aura of reality. The All Star Cast present their characters credibly and tenderly. Who does not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I have loved her work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> Most films are believed to be true because we know that this is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound engineers, etc. Express that belief in The Amati Girls. It feels so part of this family! How I wanted to defend Dolores when her family stifles her emotional life. And wanted to cheer on Lee Grant as she sets criticism of Cloris Leachman's hair color. The humor is not tummy-tingling humor, but instead has a feel-good quality that is far more satisfying than pratfalls and such. <br /> <br /> The love portrayed in this movie family should be imitated and appreciated. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the family name Amati, translated from Italian, means "the loved ones".
