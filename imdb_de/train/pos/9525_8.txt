ROAD TO PERDITION can be summarized according to the results of Thomas Newman. It is haunting and beautiful, but you know that this music is similar to Newman's other work. If you listen to the soundtrack you will be reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. The story will be shown on screen. As the Sullivans drive around the US attempting to escape a psychotic hit, think of THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and salvation can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangsterepics. Although I have seen everything before you feel that this should not be understood as a fierce criticism of Sam Mendes film, which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws working against it are a very slow opening twenty minutes, and I was a bit confused about the events that betrayed Michael Sullivan. But if you think about how much a sentimental chaos Spielberg could have made with the story of a father and his twelve-year-old son running for their lives, you can not help but think what a great director Mendes is. > ROAD TO PERDITION is a film in which the entire cast provides flawless performance. I've never been so excited about Tom Hanks, but he's as good as any starring role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but I never thought I saw an American screen legend with a bad accent - Newman's performance is because of his subtle body language, his character is torn by guilt, but Newman never milks it or leaves Furthermore. Although Newman, who scores the best in the movie, is never surprised, the two British supporting cast members Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters, and while Law still has a long career as a lead actor, one wonders, like Daniel Craig as an advanced Character actor, if he had not decided to become James Bond, a role that announces the end of an acting career
