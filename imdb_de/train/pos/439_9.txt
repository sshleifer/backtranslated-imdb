The true measure of any fictional work is whether the characters come from their experiences and emerge from the experiences that have been significantly changed (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial). By doing so, Enchanted April is a resounding one Success. As a film in general, you get a pretty good ensemble cast, well-developed characters that interest you, wonderful scripts, and beautiful sets and locations. In short, the movie is adorable. Although all performances are first-rate, there are three to mention: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual job and is overshadowed by so many others in the cast. Highly recommended, especially if you are romantic in the heart. Another representative does not say.
