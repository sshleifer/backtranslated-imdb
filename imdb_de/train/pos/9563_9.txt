First, let me say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I have ever seen. shows a poverty style background of a Cambodian. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around killing people to survive himself; has done it all his life. Sam Lee's (Wai) duty is to win the Cambodians forever. There are tons of violent acts, but a good story. The film shows the fighting between these two characters; They both fight like bad dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONG PROPOSAL !!! (GO HK FILMS)
