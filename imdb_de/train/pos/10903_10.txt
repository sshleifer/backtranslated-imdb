This man is nothing short of amazing. You really have the feeling that you have lived with him during these tragic events and finally you are crying with his family. He was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to make sure that others who survive him do not have to go through this pathetic pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "bad" day, and I always manage to see the grand and brighter side of life, just like Jonny, despite his unbearable pain. My only regret is that I did not know about Jonny earlier, as I had visited England twice in his life and could have said that I had met him. It's reassuring to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud without pain! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
