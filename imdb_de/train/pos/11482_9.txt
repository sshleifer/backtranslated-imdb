This movie is essentially shot on a handheld camera by the actors. In a sense, a mockumentary is otherwise a video diary of killers that is full of a "Columbine" attack. While this film does not answer all the big questions, it will give you an idea of ​​how easy it could be to get away with it. The film will show you how the actors illegally cut down firearms, made pipe bombs and developed a plan of action for "Zero Day". The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed a lot from their own lives, but at no point did I really perceive them as an actor (Something Tom Cruise should try). The use of the CCTV and 911 operators in the end was awesome, but I'm not sure we needed the last scene. Overall a really good movie about a very difficult topic.
