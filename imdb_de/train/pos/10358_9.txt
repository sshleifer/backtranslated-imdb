I remember watching this movie a few years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later, I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself. The cast just makes it much more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. She nails Mrs. Chamberlain's manners, the accent, and even the look. It shows the pain, the pain, the surprise and the anger that Lindy had to endure, and it's hard to realize that it's NOT Lindy. In my opinion, this performance by Meryl was better than her Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice" and would have earned her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and, for some surprising reason, has not been recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination. Overall, this film received only an Oscar nomination (Streep's best actress). However, he received several Australian Oscars and nominations Get great performances from the entire cast.
