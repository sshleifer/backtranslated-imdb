In general I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies and at first RUKA did not catch my attention. Knowing that this film was made in repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet era, I became more aware of the film the more subjective this innocent-looking little movie was. This subtext has really brought the film to life and gives it a real stamina, both as a work of art and as a political statement. The sad little movie is done without dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's happening. A cute little wooden man makes a clay pot and has a good time when suddenly a stirring, animated hand appears and destroys the pot - instead, it becomes a sculpture of a hand. Well, the woodman always tries to chase away his hand and do his own thing. Over time, however, the hand becomes more and more persistent and finally holds the man. And in the end, thanks to the meddling hand, the man is dead and his hand gives the man the funeral of a hero in a sign of true hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs loved and critically praised the film, the state (ie The Hand) banned this small parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not experience the liberation of his nation during the "Velvet Revolution" more than two decades later.
