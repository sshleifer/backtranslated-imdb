Okay, I know I should not like this movie, but I do. From Pat Morita's amiable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying yelling, I laughed in this movie. As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, he is a good movie /> My favorite part is Morita, who talks to his boss in Tokyo and drinks shortly thereafter.
