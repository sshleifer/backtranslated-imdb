"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those movies that has been reasonably declared a masterpiece - it's truly one of the most beautiful films ever made in America. It is both artistically valid and fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a great success on its first release. But be warned, it's also one of the most heartbreaking movies ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded because they did not give us the Hollywood ending, which was essentially mandatory in the 1980s. That's why I appreciate the years 1967 to 1977 for the American film. It's a time when well-made, innovative and, above all, gloomy films can be made with the big budgets Hollywood offers. This was all over with the release of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The direction of John Schlesinger makes the material the best. It combines a simple style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other movies with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged fairly well. It's still as powerful as it was when it was released. The drama, however, makes it a masterpiece. The backgrounds of the characters are never fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). As a fan of vintage commercials, I also loved the scenes that play on unbelievably grubby 42nd Street. "Midnight Cowboy" is near perfect and one of the strongest movies ever made. (10/10)
