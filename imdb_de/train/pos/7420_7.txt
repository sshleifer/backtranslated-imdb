Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly? Since drug addiction and the case of glory may have deterred Elvis' agents from being separated from the film, it was a mistake. This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is anything but great, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job creating an original soundtrack for this "period" track / musical. Like a love story, it is more a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of salvation. As with most tragedies, the hero of the story had died. Gary Busey is once again perfect in a less than perfect role.
