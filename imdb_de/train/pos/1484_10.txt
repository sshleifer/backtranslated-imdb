"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I searched for after I got married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the reality is not so different from the fiction. To anyone who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> I would just recommend to everyone else to watch this movie before and after the "I do it!" Day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
