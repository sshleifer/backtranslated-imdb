I found 'Still Crazy' wonderfully entertaining and not just for those of us who experienced this rough era of the late '60s, early' 70s Rock. My 15 year old daughter looks at me every time I pull out the DVD (do not worry, it was only three times) and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> It's really affectionate, poignant and funny nodding of the era, and every actor hits his notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad that his somewhat similar phrase in 'Love Actually' paid more attention to him. Bruce Robinson was unbelievable as Brian. He turned life into a cartoon that could have portrayed the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a name for himself as a writer. I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie, I met Billy Connolly at Local Mall (he was living here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit with him at the food court, and we discussed the movie for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before we rationally rejected it. Why play around with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was not very popular in cinemas and too many people have had a wonderful experience.
