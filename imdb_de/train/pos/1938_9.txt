The big bathroom has a low budget, indie feeling. So many times I watch independent films that have had really good reviews just to find out that they are presumptuous and chosen by people who are so blind to the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative that it's the movie Forgets a form of entertainment in the first place. <br /> <br /> I do not know if The big bad swim has a message or a higher meaning or metaphor. If this is the case, I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BBS felt good, it was simple and warm and human, there were no big dramas or meaningful insights, I connected directly with the characters. And when, as with all good movies, the end came to an end, I was saddened by the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big or looking for a quick or insightful look elsewhere, look for a movie to deliver more than it can. BBS offers a solid, enjoyable and genuine experience and I felt rewarded and fed up after seeing it.
