I am black American and I loved this soap opera. I've seen it synced to Spanish on Telemundo almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story about a black slave who had a love affair with a white commander, leading to her leadership and her open-minded, whimsical way. Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She did not take what she had and saw her possibilities. Many would claim that she had sold herself - but she tried to secure her future and that of her future children. <br /> <br /> It was such a great soap opera that I thought it would appear on DVD. but it will not be published. This soap opera was the best soap opera ever. We have to publish it on DVD or broadcast it on TV again. It is currently playing on Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the US with a paid cable. We need it again for Telemundo.
