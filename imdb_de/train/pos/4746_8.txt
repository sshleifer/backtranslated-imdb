This film seems to draw a line - on the one hand those who love it, on the other hand those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> First of all there is a lot of comedy in this movie. Many viewers do not "get it". Of course, Jet Li's mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he should, it's a joke. The guy who sewed a time bomb to his heart - outrageous? Of course it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask if this movie is so funny, why all the excessive and bloody violence? Well, on the one hand, the tolerance for this level of violence actually varies from culture to culture. And although Hong Kong audiences feel this violence is extreme, it's certainly just a little more than an average for a HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Also, Black Mask is really the kind of movie that requires the genre conventions and thrusts of a genre to push them to extremes, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of watching people being shot dead with no obvious open wounds, many people were shocked to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch spitting blood everywhere. However, the fact is that when you shoot with a fast metal bullet, it is almost certain that blood will spurt out of an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic film. It's true that the Spiderman films never have this bloody effect - but if they were true to reality, they would be! Despite its comic origin, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is the eye-catching, overstylized filming and editing. If the creators of this film were to film the Hollywood-style film (such as The Rocketeer or the recent Sky Captain movie) in Hollywood-style, I doubt anyone would have thought it offensive. <br /> <br /> But it looks like I still had fun watching this movie.
