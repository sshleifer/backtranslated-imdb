My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. As for the violence stage? Not really that violent, mostly from the baton type. Nobody really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it's certainly appropriate for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really lets the idea of ​​CG movies go where it should. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, textures made wonderful, with true depth, not being realistic, but to form an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, the rust on metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone all contribute to the whole. <br/> <br /> Character modeling, unlike many contemporary CG films, is quirky and not sweet within an artistic whole. The faces may look less malleable than in other films, but the figures are more doll-like than human-like. I think that's a good thing, it gives truthfulness, strange as it may sound, it's easier to lift your unbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothing, on par, at least at Pixar. Note only in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu fights against the giant snail; Gwizdo faces some farmers and they all have detailed clothes, so I had to stop the movie to admire it. <br /> <br /> The environment. Far beyond cars and even the wall? E. The room has been done many times, but the fantasy environment of dragon hunters is comparable only to a few scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again it's an artistic whole that effortlessly spreads many good ideas become. Gorgeous views, like the scene in Monsters Inc., where they ride all the doors through the warehouse, or Wall? E, where we see the huge garbage towers he has created. it's just the background all the way! The interlude, where they walk through the area with the fantastic waterfalls. The Great Wall, the islands float in the sky. The broccoli in the sky? This is really the place where I think CG should do something that takes your breath away and do it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic and fortunately without any vocals and purely original for the movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Inspire cartoons, especially stretch and squeeze. Sometimes not so realistic, but the 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also done well. Lian-chu, the gentle and insecure giant, is gradually gaining confidence and raising the attention of little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo, the cunning manager of Lian-Chu, finally gets rid of himself while Zoé has not really changed Anyway, but who wants this cute kid to change anyway? At least I've loved Lian-Chu more than any other character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal controversy in the group is counterbalanced by the external pressure, just like in a real fantasy story should be . <br /> <br /> The story is largely reminiscent of never-ending history, especially how the world is slowing down. The monsters are pretty common except the flock. Is the emotional effect of Wall missing? E, the movie's really strong point, but it's a lot more fun, and lacks the annoying musical scene that was played in the previous scene, and there's action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has, as I mentioned earlier, a whole vision that was seemingly rigorously pursued. <br /> <br /> It seems the setting is ready for more adventures, and I would hope so. By the way, the French actor who plays Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm happy it was not him, even though he's one of my favorites. It's nice to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give a maximum rating, a bit surprised by the mediocre and low ratings of some; I've tried to dispel some of the concerns raised by two of the lowest voice ratings. Consider this movie as an adventure and as a European movie, not unlike Hollywood, but different.
