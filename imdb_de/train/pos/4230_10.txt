For Columbo fans like me, this is the result of episodes that reveal why Columbo was so popular and how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has (as always) a field day with the witty intelligent crime writer Abigail Mitchell. Seems Abigail calls her nephew to sign some papers that make him her heir. She has never overcome the death of her niece and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) did the dirty act. To tell more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a clever role as a personal assistant to Abigail. This episode of Columbo is in a class of its own. It is a really well made TV movie. I recommend it best.
