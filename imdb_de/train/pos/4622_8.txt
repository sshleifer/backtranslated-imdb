I first came across Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven at the age of 14, working in a video library and I loved it. I recently saw the movie again and realized it was a lost treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she won an Academy Award for Beautiful Mind as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The movie is definitely a milder, cuter and softer 80s version of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful, which is why it's so good. It's honest, not like these films enforced, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with their kids. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's dad leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her to move in for his family life. With the support of Natalie's girlfriend Polly, whom Maddie Corman played excellently, she lets him. But this movie is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can get out of it. The three main points are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest that the best in their performances is to break the heart. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie for kids who have reached puberty before the teenager. <br /> <br />
