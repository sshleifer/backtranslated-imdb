The show is about two sisters who live together. Holly, the younger one, has some problems with teenagers, but on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, a boyfriend, fiancee, like most women in the world. They try to support each other, they sometimes make mistakes, but they do not give up and keep going. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I am really sad that the show is over. I'm still watching the reps :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses that I like to watch. I like the relationship of Vince and Holly, they are very natural. Gary is a natural and always makes you laugh when he shows up. With Tina Holly has found a real friend and I really like her. Lauren's character is so funny and she's a natural. I would like to see you more. This show really takes you up and makes you laugh. I wish the show was not over yet.
