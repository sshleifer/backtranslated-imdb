It's a cooking contest, Americanized. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I can not care less about cooking, but this show is just entertaining ... From the intensity that the cook puts into the dishes, to the dumb chairman. Really a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the show because it has guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's entertaining enough to watch, and the winner has generally earned the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and I'm bitter John Besh is not the new iron cook ... Ala Cuisine!
