With the severely injured Tony in the induced coma, two things happen: Tony portrays himself as living the life of a salesman attending a business conference while his family and friends are trying to overcome the possible loss of the big man. The dream sequences come from an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode when Tony turns into a mean Joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed identities on a business trip across the country. His intonation as blazer and khaki-Schnook is more Central American than an Italian bat by Noo Joisey. A nice gesture. The shockingly long-haired, hippy-dippy AJ (whom Paulie sometime calls "Van Helsing") has a beautiful scene with his fellow old man. The best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately breaks out into a territorial dispute. Vito assumes that the new-dead gene may be a closed case, which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about Vito.
