A struggling actor finds the best way to invade Hollywood, knock off the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic view of the (and not so) fighting LA actor. It brings us into this world with effortless irony and wit. It also has a polished look and a very skilful direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent movies that does not affect its production values ​​at any level. The writing is narrow, the dialogue first class. Cassini is an actor, and the role shows his talents. The climate scene between him and Rene Garcia is immediately a classic and is referred to as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it in an advanced show, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it.
