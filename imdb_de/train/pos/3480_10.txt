This is the best comedy I have ever seen! But not everyone can understand that, you have to be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) All in all, one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors play very well, but the acting of Kote Daoshvili (Pater Germogel) is in my opinion the best Role in the secondary story of the movies :)) In this film, many Georgian stars such as Ipolite Xvichia, Sergo Zakariadze, Sofiko Chiaureli, Verikoan Djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... in this movie, they play all the stars The great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie for everyone, but remember that you need good Russian language to watch this movie
