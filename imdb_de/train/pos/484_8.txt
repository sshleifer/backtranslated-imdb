Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player trying to make a comeback at a tournament hosted by Italy. His brilliance is undisputed, but his obsession with chess has hampered his growth in all other areas of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same resort with her mother Vera (Geraldine James) to find potential spouses. Vera tends to be a handsome earl, but amazingly, Natalia is more intrigued by Sascha when she's taken a walk. Sascha is also associated with Natalia and proposes the marriage at the second meeting. But with the concentration that Sasha must devote to chess and with other events in his past that still cause problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and can he become a chess master? This is a beautiful movie based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is amazing, with Watson very beautiful, like the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro perfection as a shy, awkward chess lover. James makes a pretty nice turn, as the overbearing mother and the other performers are also wonderful. As for the look of the movie, it could not be better. The scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are beautiful and the cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and is sometimes told with flashbacks, which makes it a movie that not everyone appreciates. Also the end is bittersweet. However, if you love romance novels, historical plays, great acting, knock-out scenes or the art of film making, you should not miss them. They will be defenseless to defend themselves against the multitude of stimuli.
