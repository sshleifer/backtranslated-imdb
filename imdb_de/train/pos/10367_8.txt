When I saw "A Cry in the Dark" for the first time, I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what it represented. When I saw it a second time in an Australian cinema course, I became aware of a second point: communication problems. You see, when a Dingo snapped Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were sad but did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God had wanted that and therefore could not grieve them. But as people across Australia noticed their lack of sadness, everyone believed that Lindy had done it herself. <br /> <br /> The point is, the wrong message was communicated to the public, and they turned against Lindy. Although this was a pure coincidence, it happened anyway. It can be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of the media. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise) there and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably be thrilled with what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best films ever.
