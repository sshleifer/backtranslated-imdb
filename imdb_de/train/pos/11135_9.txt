What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is the way Joe Buck connects to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect both. There is not much hope for both characters in this film, but the harsh realities that threaten both of them give the film its own optimism that these men can at least find humanity in them. <br /> <br /> This film shows Jon Voight's finest performance and probably also Dustin Hoffmans. The rest of the cast is made up of unknown characters, but rounded off by a series of character actors, including the Cowpoke on the bus at the beginning of the film. For those interested, Paul Morrissey, the disciple of Andy Warhol, appears briefly during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, this is essential. Listen.
