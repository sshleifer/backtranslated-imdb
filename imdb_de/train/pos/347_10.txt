Valentine is now one of my favorite movies. The death scenes are elaborate and most acting is good. Marley Shelton was great as a female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the "I Know ..." films). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason why I saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was terrible. The only scene I was looking forward to seeing was * SPOILER * her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely see this before you watch "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
