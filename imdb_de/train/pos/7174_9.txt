I went from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere - and I'm really glad I did that. As a great movie fan and lifelong Northern Californian, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films were shot in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area instead of going to LA, comment on George Lucas's comments on perseverance, community, and a vision that really excites me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can do it in SF, so will other artists. <br /> <br /> Would recommend this movie
