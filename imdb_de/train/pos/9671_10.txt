Paulie is a fantasy about a smaller girl or maybe her memory of how her youth grew up. Tony Shaloub performs a flawless performance as a Russian scientist (PhD), who does not find decent work in America. He becomes friends with an isolated parrot while fulfilling a mediator's duties in a behavioral science laboratory. The chief physician is a bitter man, since Paulie, who speaks and fully understands the language, embarrasses the doctor who later banishes him to the lower levels of the building where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. Paulie revokes his life with Marie and how they lost each other. The search begins to reunite Paulie with Marie, only more than 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The film ends, some predictably, with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story ends with the three who enter Marie's house, where you can make the final outcome of your choice. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
