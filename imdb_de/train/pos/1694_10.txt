If the creators of this film had made every attempt to introduce reality into the plot, it would have been just another waste of time, money, and creative effort. Fortunately, by throwing all the glimmer of reality into the wind, they have created a comedic miracle. Who could miss a movie in which an alien pilot portrays the entire movie as Jack Nicholson wearing a Lakers T-shirt. Do not dismiss this movie as a trash.
