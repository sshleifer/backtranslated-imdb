Four stories by Robert Bloch about different people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a writer, who brings to life the murderer he is writing about. Some scary moments and the turn at the end was good. In the second, Peter Cushing is obsessed by a wax figure that resembles his deceased wife. The third has Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. All this leads to a pretty scary ending (though the end in the story was MUCH worse). The last is a thoroughly funny comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing the landscape) and a cloak that turns people into vampires! There is also a nice line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good horror anthology - nothing terrible, but the first and the end of the third gave me some funny little shivers. The fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! The house itself looks beautiful ... and very scary. It is well-directed with some nice atmospheric accents. A very good and unusual film score. All in all, a good little horror anthology that's worth finding out. Try to watch it on DVD - the Lions Gate One looks awesome with vivid colors and great sound.
