While the title "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the film plays like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a botched robbery and keeps getting out of control as two brothers try to escape the chaos they are getting into. <br /> <br /> The cast is well matched with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the above brothers. Notable support includes Albert Finney as her father and Marisa Tomei as wife of a brother and lover of the other. Beyond these principles, acting is inconspicuous. <br /> <br /> The story is captivating and is told with a certain verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different viewpoints and frequent time shifts. That being said, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat subdued, as it becomes clear early on that this story is a complete tragedy. All in all, a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's direction is good, but I am more impressed by the fact that he is still over eighty years old. I was less impressed with Carter Burwell's score, but it's not a big distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film turns out to be a captivating sight and the story and presentation may have superficial similarities to others. This film remains a unique experience.
