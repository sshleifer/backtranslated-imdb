After working in downtown Manhattan, often having lunch in the park near the Town Hall during the summer days, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to leave the city hall doors behind and see what the lobby and the entire building looked like. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli," 03, did a great job throughout the picture, and in particular, giving a speech at a African American Church to a little boy who was killed. John Cusack (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury," 03, was a devoted servant of the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to accomplish. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) starts falling in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), Off Key, '01, played a mob boss who had to make some very difficult decisions towards the end of the picture! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in NYC!
