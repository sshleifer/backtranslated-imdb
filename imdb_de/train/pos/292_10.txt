Okay, first I got this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie should be in stereoscopic 3D. It's for the most part, but when the main character is in her car, the movie falls on 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to film in a car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. There are a lot of things wrong with that. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why do you show all the deaths at the beginning of the movie! It made the movie shitty whenever some were killed !!! Watch out for a good laugh, but do not waste your time buying it. Just download or something cheap.
