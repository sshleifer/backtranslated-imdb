This film makes a strong comment to the then Italians. The use of the mirrors to underline the revelations of the characters is appealing and I can not mention the beauty and splendor of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I like both of you. Your way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you wonder if the camera is actually there or not. The husband, in his short role, is also excellently portrayed as a fascist Italian, who orders his wife and children, but in his own way, a loving father. The opening scenes with Hitler on the Piazza Venezia with all Italians are unbelievable and really showcase the film historically. I loved the movie and I agree that it's weird that it's not famous anymore.
