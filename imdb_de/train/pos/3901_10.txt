This video has rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. He's not just teaching, he's doing some of the funniest observations on history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and intelligent comic I've seen in a long time. Tell all the other stand-ups to leave the stage and let this "leader" rule!
