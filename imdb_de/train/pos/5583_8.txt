I saw at least a few people who saw it on TCM on September 2nd. If you knew, did you know that Hedy had to change her name so as not to be associated with this movie when she came to the US. I watched because I just saw a documentary about "bad women", actresses in the US censors founded in the early '30s. It looked to me as if they had come through with far more than just Hedy's "most sensational" shots in "Ecstasy". In fact, by today's standards, Hedy was completely innocent and it was nice to see her early, untouched beauty. It was a beautiful, lyrical movie to relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I saw it after taking it during a sleepless early AM. I would like to release the first version for comparison in the US.
