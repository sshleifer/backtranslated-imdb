Pretty good picture of a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to beat up the lady, why not just try to find out what he wants from her and from the cops? It's dangerous to include all these characters in the story, not to mention all the mouths you have to fear to stay shut. Why did the depressed woman go out to the bar when she could barely sit in a chair or say a word? Are there really police officers cracking wisely, popping gum and grinning monkeys who are so suspiciously approaching a suspect? It probably worked well before the wheel was invented, but today it's so hackneyed and unbelievable. Catch the Manic Drum Rupture by Elisha Cook; His frenetic hammering never matched the picture. His insane facial expressions made up for the synchronization of the off-stick.
