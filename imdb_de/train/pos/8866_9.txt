"COSBY" is in my opinion an absolute CBS hit! I'm not sure I've never seen every episode, but I enjoyed it anyway. It's hard to say which one of my favorites is. I really loved the title song too. If you ask me, though I like everyone, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn had not died during the run of the show. Since then, I've always wondered what the show would have been like. Everyone has always done well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To summarize, although it is now on TBS, it is strongly recommended to catch it, just in case it gets out of the air forever
