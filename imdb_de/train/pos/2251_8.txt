I think Alan Jacobs describes the film very well, but I had the opportunity to rent the blockbuster DVD with a commentary from BYU's curator, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. The then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant agreed that the film understood the deviations from historical content for dramatic expressions and telescope events. For example, the movie showed Joseph Smith in court. Despite Brigham Young's great rhetoric in defense of Joseph Smith, he was convicted anyway. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were both killed before the trial took place.
