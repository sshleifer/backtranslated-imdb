This movie has a lot of potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (normally) excellent (though it might lose the Cheezy voice overs), the direction and the cinematography are surprisingly good, though some experiments just do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he can not play anything but Fox Mulder. He poses, he tries to be smooth, he poses, he tries to be macho. In the end he just tries too much. Exaggerating his character, he surpasses his lines, outstripping Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, both of whom are in a class above him in acting. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There were one or two spotty moments overriding his role, but you could say he enjoyed it. He looked at the role and became both physically and atmospherically character. Angelina Jolie was also very good. She did not matter much; Although I thought she could have used a much stronger one ... her character was not nearly developed enough, although she was remarkably good with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (gee, maybe Uma left him for that ...;) All in all, it was rough on the edges, but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not torn his role to pieces, that would have been all the better. 10.7.
