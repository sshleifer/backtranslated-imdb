This entertaining sticky "Death Wish" copy features the exceptionally handsome and well-endowed brunette hottie Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and a woman who opens a gigantic ten-gallon drum of wild chopsocky whup-a ** on different No-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and members of the street gangs after some evil low-life criminals attacked their beloved grandparents. The amazingly luscious Mani pokes her teeth into her stubborn, stupid, hard chick-part, with freaky aplomb, beating frightened fellows with contagious joy, and exposing her smoking, hot soul in a couple of cheeky but very popular nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani has an extremely irritating, hard and scratchy chewing spree that causes a pure murder of the ears (my favorite moment in Mani's dubious tradition of dialogue occurs when she jokes.) "Do not get bored with girls in the park, this is not the one Case nice! "After berating some hateful hooligans, Karen's only subsequent film role was in" Avenging Angel, "in which she does a really stunning, frontal nude scene, but has no lines.) The film A very sensational, gritty one Sequence appears when Mani is briefly detained for ignoring the trial and showing her considerable material in a group prison-shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cellmate is just trying to seduce her with a hard punch to counter her unwanted advances! Strangely, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she sits behind bars. With an extra galvanizing shot in the powerful, rough arm of Edward Victor's punchy direction, a funky rocking score, lovably grumpy-looking play (albeit lame), a constant, snappy pace and numerous excerpts -the-stops exciting battle scenes and the stubborn photograph of Howard Anderson III. This hugely enjoyable Down'n'Dirty Exploitation Swill is indispensable for hardcore fans of low-budget, low-budget Grindhouse movie dirt.
