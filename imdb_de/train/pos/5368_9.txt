This is a fantastic action movie with great Arnie! It's stylish, with a lot of tense action to satisfy you. The characters were great and Richard Dawson is very threatening as the main villain. Yes, it has tons of action holes, but it is very entertaining and has a great ending. It also had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. The character development was also pretty good with some excellent performances. The direction is great! Paul Michael Glaser does a very good job here, with great use of colors, consistently stylish looks, fantastic camera angles and overall very fast movie! Well done. There is a bit of blood. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, an exploding head, a slit neck, bloody chainsaw disks, dead bodies, blood and a spit. The spectacle is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is as always AMAZING, he is excellent in the acting department, has a lot of funny singles, kicks that ass, and as always he is a big physical presence! And it was a lot of fun to look at him! (Arnie rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso is fine here, she was really sweet and had a good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre is a good guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is fantastic as the main villain and he was very threatening and fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka are doing everything they need to do as stalkers. All in all a must! **** 1/2 of 5
