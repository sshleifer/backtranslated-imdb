I saw a lot of science fiction from the 70s. some were terribly bad and others thought they were exciting and really scary. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yeah, sometimes it's a bit of a fight, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but part of the movie seems to be terribly predictable. Here's a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, eerie and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are much better in this respect than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's suicide scene is eerily ahead of Kevorkian's and his ilk. Some attitudes are outdated (can you imagine a filmmaker coming through with the concept of "women as furniture" in our oh-so-politically correct 90s?), But it's rare to find a movie from the first decade that it might actually make you think this. I would like to see this on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I do not think the overall scope of this movie would have a reason. Listen.
