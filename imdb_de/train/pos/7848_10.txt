This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a funny movie or a well-made movie. This is a milestone in animation art, and even if that were not the case, only the technical skill that has contributed to its creation would be a place in the history of animation. Stop motion movie about the beetle's secret life. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, night clubs, movie houses, and even small props like posters, bicycles, and paintings. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, much to the chagrin of a grasshopper; But he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the slingshot. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle in a separate relationship. Mr. Beetle chases the lover away, but forgives his wife. The two make-up and go to the cinema. And the movie you see is Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. Described as it sounds banal, but once seen an enthralling work of the cinema. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented just about everything future animators would use for their work. For this reason, he must not be forgotten.
