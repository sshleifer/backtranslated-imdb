I see very negative contributions from people who wrote in August, although the film was released in mid-September, at least in the US. Maybe these are unfortunate emigrants in South Korea who saw it early. I am in the USA and have just seen it today. I found the special effects outstanding, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we're all used to it from many other movies. It was not difficult to follow at all. The behavior on the leads was weak, but other people were pretty good. There was humor everywhere too. I rated it 8 because I had a good time watching it, and that's exactly what I wanted.
