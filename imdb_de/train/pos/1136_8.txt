I'm not sure this comment contains a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe. So do not read this if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and so is everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent a large part of my working life in the cinema without being an actor. Such people are the _sung_ heroes of this film: the gazers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people, etc., etc., and the whole thing is at least too grandly told scope in their view. Most actors are crazy and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which makes the movie so good, but you have to work with actors to realize that this movie is a real drama! Possible spoiler alert: In a great scene, the two leading actors, both actors discussing something personal, discuss something "out-of-script" with another actor and begin to form, rehearse and criticize them Performance of each other. <br /> <br /> Since the release of the film 'What was it '91, it is fashionable to do so, especially on television. But hardly anyone has done so well.
