This televised version of the legendary stand against hopeless contradictions is more objective and realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events, though the film that was filmed after that had humanized the characters of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played by James Arness, who seems to be still alive at the age of 85. At age 65, he returns to the screen after years of doing so in this part. <br /> <br /> Puerto Rican-born Raul Julia humanizes General Santa Ana, since no one back in '54 had done it. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a horny, shameful Popinay Gaudier uniform that has never been seen before or since. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he has hired, but is convinced that his infallibility does not respect him. Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age equals his character: Col William Travis. His portrayal is serious. He is almost awestruck by the older men who are in command of him. <br /> <br /> The only glaring comment was Brian Keith as Crockett. He stumbles around in a Coonskin cap and with Ol 'Betsy as if he's from another movie. Without conviction in the presentation, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts that were overlooked or suppressed in earlier movie versions. We learn that Jim Bowie fought against his own brother-in-law in the person of Santa Ana. The Mexican soldiers were in part bad because they were armed with rifles left over from the Napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a bargain." Bowie explains dryly. The whole project of defending the former Spanish Mission as a fort was poorly advised militarily - a fact that was further explored in the movie "The Alamo" of 2004.
