After seeing the reality TV series Next Action Star, I was delighted to see the winner's film immediately. I was suspicious of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Of course, Billy Zane was his usual big self, but Corinne and Sean were standing next to him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles. Sean's character, not Billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration of discovering new rules in the game is well played. Corinne walks well through the wire rope between her figure, who likes Sean and is only there for the money. I loved how the game was played to the very last second. And then on! Not a great movie, but an entertaining movie and a great showcase for two people who were out of the gate for the first time.
