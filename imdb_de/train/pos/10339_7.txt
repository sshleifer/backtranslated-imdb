I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for African-American movies. It looked like it is; a very tendentious "crazy" comedy in which a black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that Redd Foxx's wife left him for his brother, who works with him at the "Store" in Phoenix. He went by bus to his son Norman in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> When RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powder blue bikini bottoms, climbs out of the waterbed to open the door. Norman tries to gain time by getting his older father to take the stairs to the 60th floor and tries to wake his lover, who refuses to move. It was to the point where I wrote "WHY will not he wake up?" When this suddenly happened, my jaw dropped for the first time with me and my friend when we first got a glimpse of blue-eyed, wiry-haired Garson, Norman's white roommate, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream ?? "Garson is a fiery queen of a type who can only imagine LA in LA in 1976. He has clothes, a purse and big, awkward jewelery, and he seems to owe both his looks and his personality to Carol Brady of The Brady Bunch <Br / Norman orders his lover to seek another shelter during his father's visit. Garson remains at Waylon Flowers and Madam responds when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So RF is trying to get his wife over in Mexico As he talks on the phone, Garson comes in to grab his dress and RF confronts him with an explosion of 70s soul music reminiscent of his burgeoning revelation (but sounds more like we're about to hearing a very special track from The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is, "I'll kill him. I'll kill him. "Then RF goes for a long walk in which he goes through all the thoughts of a confused parent, for example," Maybe we trained him too early. "His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk For example, a burly truck driver appears as he's just thinking about what makes a real man. "Amazingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality." It must be said that these are about eight books on homosexuality when my parents bought Then he goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF then engages Audrey, a five-meter-long Amazon prostitute (in this amazing furry thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones He hired her for Norman to try heterosexuality, but Norman gets angry and storms to bother his girlfriend Melody Then Garson comes and offers to take RF for the night. He regrets the loss of RF's wife and tells the story of his own mother, who has an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because "she was molested in a Luau." They attend a long performance by Wayon and Madam culminating in Madam forcibly banging her head against the piano until her hair loosens. Again, the mouths were indescribable. <br /> <br /> So it seems you just do not know, RF and Garson have a nice evening together! You see, quiet, traditional, older, black men just have to see the shitty, high-feminine entertainment of mega-queens to get to ALL the gay world has to offer! It is really that easy! However, this still does not prevent RF from "rape!" when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends up less predictable than you think. <br /> <br /> It was so busy. WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? It seems they have NO rapport, and Norman has no qualms about throwing Garson out, and even if he comes to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There was a kind of sweet, rustic touch, like RF, who bought all these books about homosexuality - and sat right on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent really wants to find out about homosexuality instead of just running away to get drunk or mercy on their friends. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it seems like a little relic from a bygone era, an era when some homosexuals thought that when people just sat down and drag marionettes Performance, we could all learn to love and understand each other! And, with all this naivety, the extreme stereotypes and the news-laden dialogue seem charmingly outdated and provide a lot of discussion about how things have changed for gays over the past 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay girlfriends desperately fall in love with her and are ready to get drunk to sleep with and then transform her. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, look at Cinema de Merde, my website about bad and cheesy movies (with some good movies).
