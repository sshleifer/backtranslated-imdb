I saw this movie for the first time when I flipped through the movie channels on my parents' DirecTV. It was on the Sundance Channel and just started. I love music, especially in the late 60's, and that's how the BJM sounded (The Dandies are alright). Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre fascinated me from the music to the personalities of Anton and Joel to the illegal drug use. It was funny because when I watched the first party scene when all the people were making lines, my parents walked by and decided to watch (the expression on their faces was priceless). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it's the first time I've met The Brian Jonestown Massacre, who is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just take a look ... seriously
