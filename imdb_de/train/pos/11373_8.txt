Here is a curiosity: a modern film about a serial killer who has no combat scenes, no one died, no chases and no loud noises ..... and it takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are awful. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is detective work and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very gloomy film, and "gloomy" best describes the hero's personality (Stephen Rea). Nevertheless, the story is not depressing and it is very interesting throughout. Rea is great as a determined, fast-acting detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as a murderer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays the only character in the film who radiates some warmth. <br /> <br /> Once again the story is littered here with liberal agendas, with two references to bias against homosexuals, the total validity of secular psychology, police and government officials are boorisch / coarse / bigott, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an intelligent and refreshingly inconspicuous thriller. This is a somewhat unique film that is probably unknown but popular with people who have seen it. Since it's based on a real account of this killer, it's all the more daunting. Do not miss that just because you do not mind.
