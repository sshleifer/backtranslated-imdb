I saw Part One two days ago and today I saw Part Two. Of course, the two parts are worlds, so I'm a bit shaken by everything I've just seen. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Ches death; For me it has clouded the whole movie. I suspect that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted to feel about us, the slowly developing inevitability of his death. The second part was so unpleasant in comparison to such inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive and so negative in Bolivia. The politics of the movement in Bolivia was only hinted at but didactically rarely confronted. The memorable scenes for me were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder conversation with the Bolivian official, where this official asked Che about the peasants' failure to support his revolution. I did not think that national differences played such a big role as in the conflict, Argentina against Bolivians. I found that Soderbergh coped admirably with the inevitable problems of care in a revolutionary struggle. How to get food without fighting farmers who do not have enough. I was struck by how hard it would be to try something while Che tried. I think it's all in timing; Is there enough anger against the government to start the movement? There were none in Bolivia. Che realized the terrible corundum of the revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel, which he read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, in fifty years. A very thoughtful and well-made film; Make an effort to see it.
