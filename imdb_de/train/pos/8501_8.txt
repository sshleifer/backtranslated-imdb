I think it's a great example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a great movie to show in a sociology course. I thought it was pretty funny and I have to say that I'm a fool for the plotter device "Let band get together and do the job". It seems that most people do not know that this movie is not just a comedy. It also has some dramatic elements and I think they fit in well. Overall, I give a solid 8.
