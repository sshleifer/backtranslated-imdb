This rerun of Kansas' infamous 1959 killings, based on the Capote book, is filmed in black and white by Brooks and cameraman Hall, making it documentary-like. There are good performances by Blake and Wilson as murderers and Forsythe as a police officer who persecutes them. The scenes that led to the murders and were filmed in the actual house where the crime took place, with a sound of whistling wind, are pretty intense and shivering. Brooks directs with great verve and uses several interesting transitions between the scenes. The only complaint is that it is somewhat overlapping, with the resolution and some preaching.
