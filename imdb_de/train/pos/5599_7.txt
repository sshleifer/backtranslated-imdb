This was the second time that I saw the movie (over the french language version as opposed to the first one dubbed in Italian), and I feel that the movie will be improved on later sightseeing character study, which was beautifully recorded and the Paris scenes are equally impressive. In the long run it's not a first-class Polanski, and I would rank it 9th in its filmography, but it's still a confident mix of subtle goosebumps and, surprisingly, often a broad comedy. There is also a good cast, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Nevertheless, I am somewhat confused by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to "switch" to the previous tenant; Apart from the owner of the caf√© opposite the apartment building, where he is given everything that Simone used to do, without asking him if he wished otherwise, there is little (if I could say so) that everyone knows that wanted from him! Okay, so he still found Simone's belongings in the apartment, but what exactly got him to wear her clothes and cheer her up (even if he had apparently started this unconsciously)? After his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the final section of the movie (in which Adjani has almost disappeared) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants experience his suicide attempt as a night in the opera, a concept which was used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> <br /> So the end is immediately predictable and unclear: Exactly what made the two inmates jump out the window of this apartment?! I remember that factor that bothered me the first time I looked, and I'm sorry to say that it's not clearer now! However, the first two-thirds of the film is pretty solid, but I wish Polanski had less need of dark action in the past.
