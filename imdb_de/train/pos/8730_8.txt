Many Americans would say ... what ??? Yes, I know that my comparison is without a doubt an insult to the fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is correct. We have the peasant who goes into the city to seek help against a group of locusts who want to steal the harvest of the village. The big difference is the way the story goes. Our samurai, a band of circus performers as in the original, are a very complex mix of personalities, but in the end, that's what the village needs, HEROES. Review this incredible movie (obviously the Seven Samurai) and find other films that have stolen the story and tried to achieve the same magical effect as the masterpiece by Akira Kurosawa. One tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write the bestseller, but he did not find the cat's third foot.
