"Party Girl" takes advantage of the enormous charm of Parker Posey. At times, the film seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allowed to play herself, as she is usually in real life. The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Ms. Posey's fans. Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild journey to Lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to fun in the various clubs she constantly visits. This is a time even more na√Øve than what became of this area and the adjacent Meat Market districts. At least there are no claims in the movies, and we see down-to-earth people who live normally, if we can call it that. Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey that we enjoy the movie more than if another actress had played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
