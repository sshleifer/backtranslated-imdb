The Running Man is one of those movies that would become boring and depressing when watching. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see her once or twice a year with a few buddies and a couple of drinks. <br /> In today's climate of TV media domination and capitalist mode in society, it really works as a revisionist social commentary after the boom of the 1980s. Forget that! There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is at his best as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond Belting One Liners has been fully inspired. A true leg-end day (with his call to Killian over a camera the main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the Stalker is authentically American and reflects the characteristics of the PC series "Gladiators" and also the WWE. The cruel ending of Buzz-saw will cool every viewer to the bone (as a footnote, why is his death particularly disturbing in what is supposedly an optimistic action-maker with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great supportive muscles (and in real life Arnie's buds), and Mick Fleetwood is even there! What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the Running Man if you are looking for a great piece of fun action with a good ending and some great characters. Just do not expect any formation of it (at least on the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love it. You will do it if you are not a thesp. 10.7
