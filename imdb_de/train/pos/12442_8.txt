Filming on an impossible schedule and with no budget to talk about was much better than you would expect, certainly more so than Peter O'Donnell's other two books and comics. You can read the latest issue in the reprints of Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly. It's one of the biggest adventure comics ever. The movie is not great, but unlike most low-budget movies, it makes the most of what it has, and it holds your interest. On the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people accused Tarentino of associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been done. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise and has chosen a good author and director. All in all, worth 8 stars.
