"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner Library. Disney did it again in 1994, this time with the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney had this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team, and the words were good, huh ?????). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boy a family only when the angels had won the pennant. So one night he called to God. The praying boy could see help coming along (and ONLY this boy); For example, when the first angel came down, one player struck a ball so hard that not only the bat broke, but the ball, too !!!!! For much of the 1994 post-All-Star season, the Angels were at the head of AL West (whose home team is the Rangers and is still). However, they lost a game because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (at that time there was no baseball section in baseball, so Chicago in the west) and no angels were there to help. So a new rule was created: No angel can help in championship games. But wait! In the last championship game the angels won !!!!! It was indeed a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every evening for the last few years and asked for help at school and so on. Look at me now! My work was good !!!!! First, this shows that if you believe God can send His angels down to help you with any problems you may have in life. And second, this is a family baseball movie that's always exciting. This is also an old Disney movie; I just saw it on the New Disney Channel (tin !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Outfield Angels" will change your life forever once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
