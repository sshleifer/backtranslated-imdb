I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where it got a standing ovation! This film tells a story that, to my knowledge, has never been told before - namely about the uprising of the Berlin women, who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War, in Rosenstra√üe. As such, it is a unique story, and besides, the only film about the Holocaust I've ever seen showing that there were good Germans (the helping family in "Anne Frank" was Dutch, for example) did NOT support The National Socialists actually had the power to fight the immorality and brutality of their own country during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their lives. Acting is great, the framing history in New York is interesting and complicated, Von Trotta's direction is masterful in every scene and the production values, including the great cinematography, are outstanding. Of course the family could speak German in New York. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak with their family in their mother tongue - a common occurrence. This criticism is therefore unjustified. To say more would spoil the experience. The movie is long, but I did not even look at my watch. I hope that this film will be distributed in North America, because this film is not only a masterpiece, it can even help to heal any hostility that people have against the Germans, because they have supported Hitler. If this movie is in your area, urge you to SEE! You will not regret it!
