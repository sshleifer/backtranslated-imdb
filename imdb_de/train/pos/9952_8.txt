Before I saw this movie, I thought that this movie would be great as Flashpoint because Flashpoint was the last movie by Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong that I've seen before. As for sexual scenes, I was disappointed. I thought Sexual scenes from Dreamquest would be great sexual scenes from Flashpoint, but I was disappointed. With the exception of the sex scene of Asia Carrera, I do not feel great at any sex scene in this movie (you know what I mean). The tall Jenna Jameson does not make these sexual scenes what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, these two charming girls disappoint me as much as sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although it's an adult movie, but leaving this sexual scene factor aside, this movie is very good. If typical adult film standards are concerned, this film has definitely raised the standards for adult films. Story, drama, directing, sets, make-ups and other technical material of this movie are really great. The actors in this film did a really good job of acting, they all did a great job. Dreamquest is definitely the bar for adult movies.
