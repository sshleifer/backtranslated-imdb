I really liked the film.at degree. I was in tears. This movie is incredible. You will enjoy it. I could have given it more than 10. I liked the teasing between coincidence and cheeky. I like the leadership of Shadow. Overall, this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> its continuation is good but not as good as this movie. I think there should be a third sequel. Not only this film attracts children, but adults as well. My whole family really enjoyed this movie. Chance was full of humor. Sassy is a smart cat. <br /> <br /> I say again, THIS MOVIE IS A MUST-WATCH. The more you see this movie, the more you are related to this movie. This movie is a classic.
