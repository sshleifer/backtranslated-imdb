Since I have not seen all the movies released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say that this is the best movie I have seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films with black people are either obsessed with American preoccupation with "race relations" or fall into the clichés of the ghetto in the inner city, with every conceivable germ gushing out with a square slang. Antwone Fisher is proud of this alone: ​​Race is irrelevant, except for a battle that was caused by a race arc or not. The story of Antwone Fisher is one that should resonate with any empathetic person. He is portrayed by Derek Luke unobtrusive and thoughtful. Although Denzel Washington obviously uses his star power for film production, he remains largely in the background, letting the movie become the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture in general would like to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and also Canadians, you know), this is a movie that appeals to all of humanity , I just hope that the non-black audience will see this movie for this humanity instead of avoiding it, because they feel there are no characters or actors in the movie to identify with. That would be a sad comment to the race relations in North America in and of itself. <br /> <br />
