This is the work of Neil Simon, who received a lot of praise! "The Odd Couple" is a unique jewel that lingers inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fussy freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slob. But these men have good jobs. Felix is ​​a news writer and Oscar is a sports author. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while Oscar's is on the other side of the US (the west coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together on a roof without going mad are impossible and unlikely. It's a lot of laughter and a lot of fun. I liked the part in which the two British neighbors who talked to both gentlemen and Oscar Felix retired are lucky and live with them when he did not want to have dinner with them the night before. It's time for Felix to relieve himself. I suppose all nice freaks are neat to brighten up. They can be picky, but they should also be patient. A very funny movie and a classic Nuevo. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is an absolute classic. 5 STARS!
