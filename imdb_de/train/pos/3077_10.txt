I missed the full season of the show and started to see them on the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the show. I think the entire cast is outstanding. It's one of my favorite shows ever. I have just reviewed the ABC program for this case and have not seen it on schedule. That's very sad. I hope they bring it back ... maybe they wait until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some comments about the show and see so many glowing comments, like mine. Of course I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully be picked up by another station.
