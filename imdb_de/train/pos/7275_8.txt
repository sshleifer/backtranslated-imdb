No Strings Attached offers Carlos Mencia stand-up, which makes us both laugh and think. Not only does he make fun of racial issues (as many haters claim), but he also talks about how to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated the same. .. why Americans are crazier than Arab terrorists ... why no one has to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he will do in heaven ... a theory like Easter (also known as "Big Ups to Jesus Day") the traditions began ... his contemplation of the film Passion of Christ - and his subordinate confrontation with a woman about whether he is affected by Jesus or not ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right have to tell a joke or not. And he never stops reminding us that each one of us has a voice. So we should use it to tell the truth, to say what we think, and not to be afraid of offending others. Carlos is the bomb.
