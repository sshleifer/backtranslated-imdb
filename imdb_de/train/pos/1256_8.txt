This is a very dramatic and exciting movie. There are many actions and phrases. The story or the director opens question marks on the death row or alleged crimes committed by blacks. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you like it, do not miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
