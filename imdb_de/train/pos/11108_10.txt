Well ... easily my favorite TV show ever. Call me a running mail cliche, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. in a show, and you're already gaining points in my book. Combine that with actors who excel at anything you've ever seen on the small screen. Add directing that fits in with the vintage-themed cinema, and above all writing that overcomes the mind (and a few brains a long way), and you've made it A show that can be quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Above all, there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini a way that words can not express if you have not yet seen him as Tony have, now you see him now! <br /> <br /> I can go over every character of the show, the psychological brilliance, the gripping, on and on scenes etc. but you could not stop me, so I can only say that this is the only one besides Seinfeld Show is that I can watch from start to finish again and even enjoy it More.
