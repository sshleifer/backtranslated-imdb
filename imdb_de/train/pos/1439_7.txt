CITY HALL is a bit mixed bag. Part vignettes of political life in NYC and partly moralizing history. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-style boss with presidential dreams, often gives a grumpy or subdued performance. There are a few times when he chews the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL he seems to shine here. John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance, without getting into the caricature of a New Orleans dialect or getting into the melodrama during the climax of the film. Danny Aiello as political leader is also very good. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The main problem of CITY HALL, and it is in many ways a good movie, is the general feeling of a lack of impulses. It seems more like a documentary than a movie. We see the plot or follow the story from a distant perspective, and of course the viewer is not involved. If the viewer does not meddle to some degree, he becomes apathetic to the characters and ultimately the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate came as a "Hmmm ... um ... okay". They say that you can not fight "City Hall" while the clich√© is carried on foot. Still, it still can not stop you from thinking about what might have been if they had only compounded the script and tempo of the movie.
