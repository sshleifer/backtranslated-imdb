"Shall We Dance?", A lighthearted film from Japan, tells the story of a retired accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman whom he sees off the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio are dance lessons, and most of all, he himself. "SWD" is an award-winning film that is worth a look for more mature audiences. (B)
