Mysterious murders in a European village seem to be the result of THE VAMPIRE BAT Horde, which plagues the terrified community. <br /> <br /> This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood studios in Poverty Row. The scanty production values ​​and the rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and give it an almost expressionistic quality. All in all, it leaves the viewer feeling trapped in a bad dream, which is appropriate for a thriller of this kind. <br /> <br /> Although the final explanation for the heinous crimes is quite ridiculous and not true plot development, the film can boast of a good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill gives another of his typically good performances, this time as a doctor conducting scientific research in an old castle. The beautiful Fay Wray plays his assistant in a role in which she has to look little more than beautiful and worried. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as a baffled police inspector, who is also Miss Wray's friend. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who could be extremely funny given the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray's hypochondriacal aunt. Older Lionel Belmore plays the frightened mayor of the village. And the little Dwight Frye, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films of FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is most effective here as a bat-loving madman.
