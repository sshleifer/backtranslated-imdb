I just sat by a very pleasant, fast 45 minutes ROLL. Roll is a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat travels to town to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and makes a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat gets pulled into Georges world. <br /> <br /> I loved the way Mat George teaches morality and respect, while George Mat teaches how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien worked well together and did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Every character in the movie has complemented each other very well, the two policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra brought the movie a big comic relief. Tiny played a sympathetic gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters 'Pando' by Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it showed the cities where I grew up, living in Perth and Fremantle for 20 years. It was nice to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> These Rocks 'n' Rolls
