I think this movie is well done and realistic. If you're watching Hollywood action movies, use this standard as the default to rate this movie. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce. I have no experience with the Swedish military and therefore I can not show any mistakes in how they act. But having seen the "making of" extra, I am convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie that I will recommend to others. High quality realistic story and movie.
