I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I can not remember where I saw it. I must have been about 14 years old. I loved the movie and wanted to see it again. It once came on the Kung Fu channel, but I missed it. I was really angry. It's the best special effect kung fu movie I've seen so far! I highly recommend it, and now that I've found out where I can get it, I can enjoy it again and for years to come. I also have to watch the movie Return of the Venom, some of which have spoken so highly.
