Many people say that Al Pacino played, but I think that's obvious for a movie role like this one - a Cuban drug king you have to exaggerate a bit in this role with this Cuban accent. Overall, this movie was a really good movie, which I rated myself 10/10. I would highly recommend people to watch this movie.
