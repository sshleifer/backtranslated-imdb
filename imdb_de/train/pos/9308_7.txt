If you're accustomed to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I suggest you watch this movie. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all the actors in this movie really do great things. If you have about $ 11 (that's almost nine pounds), I'll order it online or rent it from your favorite movie rental company. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you usually like gangster films or not. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of the movies you'll never forget and watch again and again. You will talk so much about it that your friends will beg to lend it.
