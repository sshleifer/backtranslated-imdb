Put yourself in Carla's shoes. It is a revised, unrecognized administrative work that is invisible. You know her: She has trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all bodies are buried, and even looks at you in the mirror when brushing your teeth. She always has time for another thankless task and does it better than most, despite a severe disability. She has the desk on her way to the toilet, which becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging for spillage. What? You do not want to hear it? Well, she can not and will not wait until her hearing aid is inserted. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hard of hearing. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work does not lead anywhere; Friends rely on them to meet their domestic needs, and the only way out begins with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. She does not go on vacation - a contract gets critical - the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla sets requirements that convey her true needs: a "well-groomed" man. This brings an applicant for approval who reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) does everything wrong from the start, and his attitude clearly shows that Carla is interested in his non-professional qualities. She sees potential in this former thief and as the story evolves, her relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependency. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside the prison walls, and is in a different kind of prison: an office office and another paying off an old debt. His thieving skills help Carla win a political fight in the office. But Paul sees Carla's cleverness in lip-reading as a greater opportunity and draws her even deeper into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal movie noir that is not rated and is probably suitable for older teens. Carla becomes more and more powerful both professionally and personally as the story progresses and her disability brings her clear advantages over the rest of us. She grows up as a woman and discovers her sensual side as she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles that exist in a man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are strangely intended for each other. Without Paul, Carla remains in her role as a doormat. She has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes, even if she does not make the best decisions on the way. <br /> <br /> You hear the world through Carla's ears, through awkward settings of your hearing aid, muffled sounds that are almost inaudible without them, to relatively different voices when you see who is speaking. With a meaningless meaning, we see that Carla has an increased intuitive ability to compensate. And we can all use that sense not only to hear what people are saying, but also what they really mean.
