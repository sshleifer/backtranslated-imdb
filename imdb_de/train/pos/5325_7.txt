The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles seems to be a damned idea, as no production can capture the idea of ​​the actual historical Beatles. Then it may be best not to try to recreate the past, but to create an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material. This is exactly what Birth of the Beatles, the simple story we know of without extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here on *** <br /> <br /> warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates expect. The Beatles play songs that were hardly composed at that time. The Beatles play Ask Me Why, P.S. I Love You and even Do not Bother Me. The Beatles graduates should realize that younger audiences will not recognize the Beatles they've met when the Beatles only perform songs in the movie that actually made them in Hamburg. From this original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love Me Tender" are retained. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production hardly look like the originals. The movie is still good to watch as the movie is pretty accurate for the rest. The guy who plays Lennon is doing well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment he sells Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie. As a bonus, you can also see the original Cavern Club in the movie.
