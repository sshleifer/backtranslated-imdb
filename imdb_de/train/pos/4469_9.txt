In the 1940s, musicals usually had a fixed formula - and if you've studied movies, you know what I'm talking about - a certain yardage, very "eye-catching" performances that were great on the surface, but never into the real ones Western personalities came across characters, etc. <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and worth the nomination for the Best Picture of 1945 (though he had no chance to beat the eventual winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. He really comes into his character as a "sea-wolf" and thinks (initially) that "picking up girls while on vacation" is nothing but a lark. And if you had to invent a "story" to get it - so be it - until. Like the Music Man when he "gets his foot stuck in the door". The film's last joy is mainly due to the attempt of his and his new friend (Sinatra) to do well the "story" to get the "girl" in which he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love. You will have to watch the movie to see what I mean. Aside from the fact that there are so many other elements of a great movie in this film, this is a classic buddy story, nostalgia at a time when the Second World War was almost over (the war ended about one) Month after the release of the film), a realization that a guy who has always laughed about life can find out that he is really a great person, great songs and probably some other elements of classic filmmaking I can not think of now , Why not a 10? Toward the end - with almost 2 1/2 hours it feels a bit long. There is a small ballet number that gave Gene Kelly a sensation, but it seemed dated in 1945 and only takes minutes. But overall, this is a definite winner at every level.
