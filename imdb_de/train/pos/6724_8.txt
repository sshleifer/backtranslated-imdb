As a popular sport, surfing was popular with many people. Immediately after seeing the documentary, I realized how dangerous it can be. In fact, the surfers were also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by it. But they still surf and have fun. Only brave people can. <br /> <br /> According to surfers, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave hit them. You must be prepared for your best and avoid direct blow from the big wave. Of course, winning it brings great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The amazing cinematography can not be missed. This is absolutely visual enjoyment. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentation. 8.10
