This movie is incredible. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly in the form of a fireball and jump over the trees, this film tells a classic story of the struggle between good and evil. The last showdown is especially breathtaking. The music score is kind of cool. <br /> <br /> Very, highly recommended. Not for the smallest children. This one deserves a 10.
