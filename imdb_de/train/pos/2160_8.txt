This film is about a man who has been too much grasped by the accepted convention of success, trying to be always mobile and working hard so that he can be proud to own his own home. He assumes that this is all to life until he accidentally starts dancing just because he wanted to take a closer look at a pretty girl he sees every day in the dance studio as he drives the subway home His was first in love with her and went to the dance class to worship her, but he finally lets himself go and goes to the dance. It finally becomes clear to him that there is more to life than to work to death. There are a number of strange characters who also learn in the studio, which gives the movie a lot of laughter and a certain sense of connection between the downtrodden. <br /> <br /> There are also revelations of various characters, including the girl he had initially admired, giving them some depth by showing their unclean past and their struggle to overcome them. <br /> <br /> The dancing was also engaging, with the big competition in the end, but it's not the usual story in which our underdogs come out on top by winning it. Instead, there are falls, revelations, and redemption. <br /> <br /> All this makes the movie a moving and entertaining movie.
