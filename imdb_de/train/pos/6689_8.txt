As a comic reader who still sees me as a total kid, I admit that I was perhaps a little biased towards this movie. I mean, there has not been a good superhero movie for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent admissions (see Blair Witch Project), I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men was definitely not a real suspense and suspense action movie, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. Everyone in the small theater laughed, got applause and laughed at the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are funny as always and Azaria adds just the right touch of craziness. William H. Macy plays a great straight-man, while Kel Mitchell and the fart-driven Paul Rubens are just added to make the little ones happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes rip off) (both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. There are a few lines that catch even the most confused spectator and bring tears from the tummy ache below us. <br /> <br /> I can definitely recommend this movie. Although it's not a perennial classic, it's twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retreads. The writing is good and the cast is great. If you are worried, schedule the matinee and pay less. In any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us does not go to the losers from time to time?
