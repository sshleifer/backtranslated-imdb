This is one of many cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a space dog named K-9 is also included. This Looney Tunes episode is very funny, has reasonably good animations (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is pretty funny, so be prepared, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian was sent to Earth to capture a creature on Earth and bring it back to Mars. With his trusty dog ​​K-9, Marvin sets off and soon finds the trail of no other rabbit except Bugs Bunny! He greets them with goodies and thinks they are tricks or treaters in their costumes. He does not know that they are preparing to bring this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I can recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and middle of the episode, you probably like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
