You like solving puzzles? You like complex narratives? This is for you. Brilliant, clever film by Francis Leclerc (son of the legendary French-Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Eye-catching photo and ingenious editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly supported by Roy Dupuis, who is Dyrbian in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a veteran in his 40s who has just woken up from a coma, being separated from an unknown person. Tournur can hardly remember who met him when he ended the suffering of a stag on the road. He has a strange behavior throughout the fight and it seems that something has taken over him. <br /> <br /> Not scary, but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my hypothesis about the end (I think the Indian caused the accident), but this end was open to all explanations. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend it 9.5 / 10
