After seeing Charley Boorman with Ewan McGregor on Long Way Round, I was very interested in what Charley would look like on his own show. I thought Charley was a nice guy, very down to earth and down to earth. It's nice to see celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it just shows that they're human, too! I do not know much about motorcycles, but this show has grabbed me from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am intrigued to see why Charley and everyone else are doing it and how far he is coming. I love the pace of the show and the fast happy music. I can not believe he broke his collarbone. I hope it is not the end. I can not wait to see the next episode ...
