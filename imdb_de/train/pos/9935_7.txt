My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {TO EDIT. CUT. Play} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director who had so much dizziness for his style. By now, it's obvious that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's choppy, eye-catching and dizzying editing technique. If I have to decide if I have to love and hate it, I would say that I love it. It was at times borderline distracting, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge over his style and some originality (though he's heavily borrowed from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic advance manifests itself when Keira Knightley plays the role of daring bounty hunter Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue is strangely choppy. Otherwise, she plays her badly because I hated her character a lot and did not sympathize with her a bit, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she unites with bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew gets involved in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract with Christopher Walken's television production company (what does Christopher Walken do in every movie, by the way?). I think that's a clever cinematography, because Tony Scott can now use as much eye-catching MTV / Reality Show footage as he likes. It becomes at this point a pastiche of MTV culture. <br /> <br /> It then follows that the story is told at an amazingly fast pace, with a lot of sparkling, strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes. It's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty nice mess. It's ultimately flawed in many ways (the actors are trying too hard to make their characters "cool"), but it works. I give it a weak 7/10, which seems generous compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who rated this movie. but I have the feeling that it had some good ideas and implemented them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
