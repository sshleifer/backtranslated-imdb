The documentary presents an original theory about "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series graphs several episodes that strongly support the theory, and defends the theory against popular criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply confused when I found user comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say documentaries represent information that is taught in middle school. In fact it does. In fact, I really liked the original look at the information I had learned since middle school and the unexpected analysis. So if you want to know why things work, if you've tried the phone to find out how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how cows are milked, you will Enjoy the series. A definite recommendation.
