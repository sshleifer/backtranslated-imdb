For fans of Troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a bit of bloodshed then this movie for you! There is a lot of blood shed in this movie, and the effects can be impressive and impressive. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, and not limited to what we expect as a movie viewer today. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy are the little aliens that I found cute. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films like Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for this crazy Japanese film set filled with wonderful darkness and bloodshed. Of course, when you see this movie, you should already have knowledge of the two.
