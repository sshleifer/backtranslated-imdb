Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. It's been too long since you appeared in a movie, and what a movie that was, it was 24 no, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like Michael Douglas, who was at the head of the contested Secret Service Agent , Kiefer's character is the one who chases Michael Douglas the whole movie. Kiefers partner, Eva Longoria, the Desperate housewife. wow, she can actually behave well and look good next to the flirt. I wish Kim Bassinger had a bigger role, but other than that, I really think the entire movie was a huge success from start to finish. This movie is in my opinion a political thriller, everyone has played his role to the stop. Nothing was revealed in the movie to keep you guessing. and I really believe that Kiefer did a damn good job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the best performance of the day, thumbs up.
