If I've ever been asked to remember a song from a movie of yesteryear, then it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Couple Chalo" because it says it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailboat drives against the black background and the shining stars. The other one would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was the last film by Meena Kumari before she died, and the time he needed can be seen on the screen. In each of the songs shown in pictures, she looks young, but not afterwards. But one actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her feet after accidentally going into her cabin, and when he sees her, he leaves a note in he describes how beautiful they are. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story which, if at all possible, should only be shown on a big screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and the songs. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Kamal Amrohi has now begun to revive his grandfather's studio with a comedy movie.
