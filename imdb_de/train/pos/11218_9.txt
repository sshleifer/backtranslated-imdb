This anime is a must for fans of Evangelion. It is an earlier work by Anno Hideaki, but his uninhibited, dramatic style certainly exists. Those who did not like Evangelion might find this version a bit tastier. Gunbuster is rather unique for sci-fi animations because it is actually based on real science. In fact, there are several small "science lesson" interlates on the show that explain the physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the big dramatic points in the movie is the relative time course at speeds close to the speed of light. The series is a wonderful piece of work to cope with the imaginable traumatic experience of leaving Earth on a six-month mission that moves near the speed of light and returns to an Earth where ten years have passed , The main character stays at the age of 17 or 18 throughout the show, while almost all other characters age considerably. Be warned, this show is sometimes hard on the juice. It also has some of the most unearned breasts I've ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore the tight uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, as the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with low juice tolerance may want to stay away from this series. Interestingly, as always, Gainax has managed to spend the money in the last few episodes. However, they managed to use black and white films and still sketches to still achieve a good resolution. The end is a bit stupid, but I felt so good in my stomach that I could not help but love. Gunbuster is in my opinion one of the most beautiful pieces of anime.
