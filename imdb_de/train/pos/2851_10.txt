Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, in which the three main characters literally go through almost the entire movie and hunt because of strange circumstances and strange coincidences. As they walk, we can see what's going on in their heads and how they have come up to date. Running is a metaphor for the lives of these happy people. In a way, what they really hunt for is not what they were originally chasing, but a meaning for their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. When walking, everyone really feels alive. The big, life-changing running adventure ends when they're inadvertently in the midst of something big, violent and so absurd that it's cleverly funny. One of my favorite movies ever by Genius director Sabu.
