I have to agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and sweet, of course Jim Belushi deserves his stripes! But I really liked the piano song. If you're a musician or just not watching this movie, you know what it's all about. <br /> <br /> "You are nobody until you love someone."
