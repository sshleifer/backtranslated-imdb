Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this detestable, dark, and expertly made thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself), who challenges his two sons to participate in cruel ax murder, claiming that the victims are not humans but "demons." and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". This is all told in a flashback by one of the sons who have since grown up (Matthew McConaughey) into a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically. Better than most serial killer features, it's a curvaceous and disturbing story that's neatly told with a minimum of cinema gimmicks. Fortunately, Paxton hardly shows any blood until the end. Especially the two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter from "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance") did well. The only reason I deducted any points is because I understand that some people find it hard to stomach. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
