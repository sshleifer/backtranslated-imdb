This is a quirky movie the British are doing so well. Low budget, cameo rolls, well executed. The story is a bit weak, a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to rally the "blonde bombshells" - a (almost almost all) band of girls that occurred in London during the war. I really liked the way the film was used by young people shows that they have no monopoly on feelings, love and even lust! That the "old wrinkles" can also laugh well. Judi Dench was great as always, pity we did not do it I will not see any of the other "blond bombshells, the end was a bit rushed, I thought" I kept thinking as I watched David Jason would have made an even better Patrick than Ian Holm, although he was quite appropriate as a "transvestite" drummer - all in all, a happy movie worth a night with the girls :)
