First, this movie was not released (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), I say, they thought the story of crooked policemen, politicians, and committed newspaper people was killed money & run. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I usually like this kind of movie, especially with this mentioned cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and on the distaff side, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. The plot and the story were made to death, BUT the above cast brings life into this violent movie and is actually worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is a dedicated young reporter for a disposable paper published by Morgan Freeman. The others are either crooked cops and politicians or some decent people. The 2 ladies are the friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is needed. It is quite violent, many murders etc., not for kids. By no means is this a great movie BUT for what it is & the cast It's definitely good, ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
