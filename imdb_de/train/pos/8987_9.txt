I recently rented this document after hearing that I heard it from IMDb.com and was fascinated by the premise. I knew very little about these two bands, but I remember listening to and enjoying The Dandy Warhol's "Not If You Were The Junkie On Earth" centuries ago. Other than that, this is my perspective on the document: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible about this film is that there is no need to have any prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) wastes no time in gaining the audience and familiarizing them with the people in the film. I was quickly drawn to the lives of both Anton and Courtney as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of what makes this document so good and what makes Ondi Timoner a documentary filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "history" of these bands was told. Most of what you see is on tour with the bands. Both bands initially play small venues and fight to get into the record industry. Throughout the film, each band strives to remain uniquely and unchecked by the norm. However, this makes the two bands similar and thus the brilliant perspective of how two spring bands can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would basically recommend this to anyone who likes movies in general. You do not need a special love for documentaries or any of the bands. Appreciation for music helps, but the music itself shuts off the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
