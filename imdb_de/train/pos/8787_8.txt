This movie has improved my opinion on Errol Flynn. While Flynn is best known for his savoir-faire and his sprezzatura (to use a few top European titles!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch himself as an actor (if only slightly) a carefree social climber with one big ego and a corresponding nervous feeling. The side occupation is outstanding. Everyone seems to be well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story is lively and, although not particularly profound (it may intentionally miss the opportunity to make social commentaries on the massively unequal income distribution at this time), it entertains and satisfies safely. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is fairly faithful to the story. I also liked the great depictions of San Francisco from the 1880s. All in all, there is little to like about this film ... worth the time to watch it.
