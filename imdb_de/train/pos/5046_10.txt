There's so much trash on the cable TV channels that I've met a gemstone with this one. From beginning to end it grabbed me and earned top marks. <br /> <br /> Father of two sons hears messages from "God" to kill people who are said to be "demons". <br /> <br /> If the opening credits showed the director as one of the performers, this can often be a warning about a bad movie; For once it's the other way round here, because the drama is uninterrupted from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there's no moment in the movie where you're not totally thrilled as there's no unnecessary or unnecessary background. Plots, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All performers convince, especially the outstanding main child actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "Silence of the Lambs".
