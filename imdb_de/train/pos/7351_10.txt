This is one of my favorite Govinda films of all time and the best movie from 1994. David Dhawan makes this movie great, he makes it fun and adds family drama. Govinda is like Raja Babu and offers a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate. In this movie she is a little less annoying, but in some scenes she is still annoying. Kader Khan is a master of acting while still offering a great performance. Aroona Irani is great as a mother and offers a great performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the buddy. This movie has comedy, action, family drama and romance full of entertainers.
