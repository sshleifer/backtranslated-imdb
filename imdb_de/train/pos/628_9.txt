This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really let the movie go far. Without giving away the plot, I would call her a new darling of the princess bride, who should outlast time. In this movie you see a very different side of Robert DeNiro! (The prize is only worth entry!) All elements are from adventure to romance and well-placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did it!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism. <br /> <br /> deserves an A. (I hope it's good at the box office)
