This was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about five at the time. It really scared me! But that night I put chewing gum on one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother got very excited. She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW THIS IS A FILM! Hey, it's time it was a great movie. This head, sitting on the bench top, was as real as it was then. And if your 5 is very scary! Children are spoiled these days with special effects that show too much and leave nothing to the imagination of your mind. Your mind can imagine things more frighteningly than special effects! (IMO)
