I just love this movie. It is a perfect example of the rounded, surprising stories that come from Asian cinema. Recently, there was a Hollywood remake with Richard Gere and the terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two films. The original Japanese movie is touching, subtle and wonderfully played. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was horrified when I first saw the trailer for the resumed US version and who starred in it. In the worst case, it's typically unoriginal uncompromising in Hollywood. The remake confirms the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason why the original movie was not widely viewed is the dislike of the US audience for subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film would never work in American stories is the restrained, extremely socially conservative film. This movie is about the character of the public Japanese personality. Certainly, the main character will come to a broader understanding of living a vibrant life through dance, but half of the movie's suspense comes from the stereotypes and mockeries in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch this movie In its original form not the terrible full screen. And please do not skip the US remake ... it's a flat travesty compared to the original Japanese movie Record the story, but the only two people will likely soon see this and the new US remake. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, outstanding movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian identity mistake! 3.Shiri-A A Korean action image that mixes both Asian flares and US action. 4.Run Lola Run - A German film that ingeniously integrates its techno score. <br /> <br /> Well, just a short list :-)
