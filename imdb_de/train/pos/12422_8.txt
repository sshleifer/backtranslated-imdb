With the mixed reviews I got, I did not expect too much and was pleasantly surprised. It is a very entertaining little crime film with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, airy writing and a good pace. It looks good too. Apparently people either like this movie or they just hate it, and I'm one who liked it.
