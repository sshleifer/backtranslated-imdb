This movie is not about entertainment or even about a movie you would like to see to pass the time. This movie is a true portrayal of true love that can only come from God. You can not help but feel deeply touched when watching this movie. We have different dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God that is beautifully presented. God's love goes beyond the heart and mind and is eternal. There is love in a marriage. As the protagonist grapples with his wife's illness, he realizes, through God's love, that he loves his wife more than he can ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. After all, you have the love of child and parents. The children in the family come together and realize that nothing else is important, except that love defeats fear. Dear friends, love is not love if it does not come from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let him know that you love him. Love does not do any good if it is not given to another. I pray that this film can inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen!!
