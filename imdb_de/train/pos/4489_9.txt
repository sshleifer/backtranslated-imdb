This movie is NOT about a cat fight, as stated in the other comment. It's about a cat who has used up eight of her nine lives and now lives in the fear of losing the last. The cat is restless and scared to death at any time, hence the name "fraidy cat". Fraidy Cat's earlier lives haunt him as ghosts who come from different eras and constantly try to kill him, but he is afraid of the ninth life, which is depicted as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and the lighting spits out bolts. very old now, but it would still be fun for the kids if you got a copy of it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a kid almost every day: o)
