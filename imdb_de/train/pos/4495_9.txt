Outside the household, there is another world, and the family has difficulty crossing the line between the authority of the fathers and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is trapped; The bakelite bridges, the Georgian floor pan, the picture rails, the wallpaper paper, the short skirts, the cheeky boys, the mini-van and the modern, modern mangles. <br /> <br /> The situation is recorded; A wind-blown, glacier-carved, rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deceit, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty. Victims, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenthood are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevant today as never before. The fact that some of them are not addressed directly is a testimony to the attitude of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the art of acting, history and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something bad about this film, the deep-rooted and wonderfully used tension will be swept away too easily in the end. Maybe I misunderstand that the fate of many teenagers really disappears when they handle it (**) - maybe the movie is trying to send that message as well - it's worth doing. <br /> What is the movie trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents fight too, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, the fight can end happily. Parents: Do not try too much! Remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simple, right? Sometimes the movie feels that way, but then you realize how much is challenged and uncovered. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems themselves.
