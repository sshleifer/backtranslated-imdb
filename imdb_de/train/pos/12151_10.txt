This is simply the epitome of what should be done for a television movie. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were at school when we stumbled over it. The cheesy spectacle. The badly written script. The good old boys. The ridiculous, but somehow obvious clich√© and banal premise. Riding in pickup trucks with your raised wife. It has everything. <br /> <br /> You'll meet well-known characters: gold digger-hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to do it alone, friends who know better, daddy who knows better, but drives away son. And the woman, the corpse. Erected In a pickup. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Since we saw this beauty, some things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies". Everyone involved in his creation deserves a medal.
