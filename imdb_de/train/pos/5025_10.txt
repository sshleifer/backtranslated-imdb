Man, some of you people have to cool down. This movie was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for arguments or messages to justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that it's a fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of the people here are trying to be movie critics - and they are not feeling well. I'm so impressed by Bill Paxton's movie and task of directing that I'll personally contact him to tell him. You know, if you did not try to analyze the possibility of action, you could just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did it!
