Do you think you have had a hard time? You should watch this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a Marine Diver should be an inspiration to all of us. And when I saw this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of it! Cuba Gooding Jr. does some of his best work so far as Brashear. As always, De Niro is as good as the southern Redneck who trains him. George Tillman made a quantum leap in his second feature film (after Soul Food) as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, be sure to check it out.
