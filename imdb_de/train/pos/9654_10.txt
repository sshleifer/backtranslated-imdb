Stephane Rideau has already starred in his Wild Reeds tour de force and is one of France's biggest indie stars. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets up on the beach on vacation Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced ethereal performance). Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon the two fall in love. <br /> <br /> The film's broken narrative - consisting of long flashbacks, parts of the present, and real-time forward movement into the future - is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal the period we are in and it can be difficult to follow the story. But persevere: The last 45 minutes of the film are so captivating that you can not take your eyes off the screen. This movie is called Breaking Heart and uplifting to "Beautiful Thing" as a must-see movie theater.
