That was a gem. Amazing acting from the main roles Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all supporting actors. The film raises a theme that not only relates to the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also to many communities around the world and many marriages within those communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how the religious beliefs and traditions of a loving and passionate family have turned their backs. The title "Love shared" could not catch it better. Although it was a true story and happened in Ireland from the 50th year, I saw how the life of the whole village eroded and "pogroms" begin, to Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and, unfortunately, hidden deep in human nature. As in the movie, the character of Liam Cunningham says, "Hatred has always been below the surface." It was interesting to see what moral choices people make in this story. Also, the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was very significant. However, history gives hope that love for two people can overcome everything, and love makes us better and stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the entire transformation throughout the story and becomes a man he always wanted to be. To act again is a first class thing. The story is fast. The Irish landscape is more beautiful than ever. Highly recommended.
