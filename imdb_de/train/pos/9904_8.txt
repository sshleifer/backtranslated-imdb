Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was molested and harassed in high school. A group of kids played pranks on him, and those pranks were really bad. The last stroke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> until 5 years later. The gang of children meets again for a reunion. One of them set it up at the old high school. The school is now abandoned and they have to break in. For some reason, the caretaker is still there, but he tells them to go on and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start celebrating and looking at their old lockers, and they see something of Marty's. One girl is sorry for Marty, but another man calms her down. <br /> <br /> Once the killings start, it's great. Every murder is creative and bloody. We see a character in a fool mask chasing her all over the school. It looks like Marty is back for revenge. After the first person is killed, they realize they are imprisoned in the school. They are looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now there are a lot of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a five-year reunion. Second, after the first child dies, a girl gets blood. They all run away in panic, but she runs into the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Her boyfriend was just killed and she decides to take a bath!? More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bath? Anyway, the bathtub does not seem to work ... and she dies a terrible death, this is a movie from the 80's. it's a horror slicer. WHO CARES, if it has some illogical parts. I do not for one. This movie has really great deaths. The end .... there is a turn. Having recently seen Haute Tension, I can compare the two. The only way they resemble each other is that there is a twist that somehow disappointed me .... THEN right after the phrase comes a great, if not the best kill in the movie /> After the last one Kill looks at the killer on the screen and also does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to end the movie. It got me "wow ..."
