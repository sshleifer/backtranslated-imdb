After Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meyer's "Vixen" and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls") had been imprisoned no less than ten and not more than 40 years for being drugged to their knees Last film role) must get used to the life in the big "doll house" in this early film of Jonathan Demme, or at least try it. Due to the unadulterated nature and the pure observability, I would also call this one of his best films, right under "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but far above the other films. This little classic is simply belligerent, slippery and fun enough to be an amazingly guilty good guy, and luckily he never once flooded all the parodies of the Women In Prison genre. Almost the rancid bad taste of the ridiculously preached "Philidelphia" out of my mouth. However, the film is not without its demise (the 'un'talent' show is a HUGE task that can be pushed through and takes far too long, Barbera Steele is sad, among other little things). But do not let these attacks stop you from an otherwise enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> My grade: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 5 minutes interview with Roger Corman; Occupation & Crew Bios; Original trailer; and Tags for "Candy Stripe Nurses", "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity) & "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl " Rainbeaux "Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and several others show skin
