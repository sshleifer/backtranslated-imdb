The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it's funny, funny and has a great voice. The show is about the family of a lion, which shows the attraction of Siegfried & Roy. All are stereotypes, but that makes them so funny. FOTP is not a kiddie cartoon, but contains some gross adult humor, but in a very mild way. It's full of popculture references and famous cameos and most of them are very well executed. I'd say I give the show 7 out of 10 because it's pretty well done, but not very original. I have seen most of these clich√©s many times, even in this particular order!
