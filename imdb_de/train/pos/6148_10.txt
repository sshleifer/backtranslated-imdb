IN LOVING MEMORY BY DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this witch story in World War II. The scene that impressed me the most was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to see this army without a body to fight the astonished singers. This movie is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which became the most fantastic place in London for me) to the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always great, it seems to be the good aunt of a family, and David, with his always astonished face, is her great co-protagonist. We will miss him very much.
