I do not just say that as a Chris Rock fan, I say that as a person who had low expectations for this movie and proved to be wrong. The first mistake was that everything was a good ending that everyone saw coming. The number two mistake was that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock was wrong. After all, the acting was inferior in this film, with Regina King was the best actor and Mark Addy the worst. but I missed that mistake and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, Heaven can wait instead, it's better. You'll love all Chris Rock fans, WATCH THIS MOVIE. He has a good stand-up in this movie. <br /> <br /> Total: 7 out of 10
