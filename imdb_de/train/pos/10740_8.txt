Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, narrated by Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon, this is a compelling and heartbreaking story of how New York's finest day shone on its darkest day. I saw this for the first time when I was a young naive twelve-year-old, and at that age, it still touched me. Knowing how serious the 9/11 really was when he saw that this would extend the overall effect of 9/11. We found out who the heroes were, how everyday life was there, and how they set their life in a situation where most people just ran and saved themselves. These brave men are putting their lives on the line and watching this increases my admiration for them. See, if you can, this is the best documentary I have personally seen.
