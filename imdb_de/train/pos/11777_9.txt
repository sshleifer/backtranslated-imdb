"Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples in the world did not have domesticated animals, but the Europeans did, which explains why we made steel and invented complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasons for this documentation or the original book. Please do not ruin this great piece by its simplicity. The reasons are much more complex than what you mentioned. Please read the book, it is a great source of information. I really enjoyed it. This book is even taught as a textbook at some universities.
