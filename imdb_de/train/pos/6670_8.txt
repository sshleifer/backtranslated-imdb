There are many problems with Mystery Men. First and foremost, there are too many different characters for them to receive complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects affect the story and are not really special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pitiful, youthful role as a character who farts and speaks only with an inaudible accent. Now on the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as a shovel is perfect. The Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character that is just mysterious and spits out only the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very amusing and shows a weak character trying to make it into the big superhero leagues. All characters do, and that's an area that I found particularly ironic. That's because all the actors are indie movie actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason why I failed at the box office is that America does not. I get irony. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the movie, but I think it would have worked better if more effort was put into the script instead of having unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
