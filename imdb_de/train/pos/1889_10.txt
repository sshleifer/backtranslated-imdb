My family has seen Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie was first released. We memorized most lines. I saw it two weeks ago and I'm still tickled by the simple humor and perspective Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli has done a wonderful job as a sidekick - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just makes it fun to watch movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fianc√©'s house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father spits sideways. Butler's line "Would you like to wait in the library?" Followed by Arthur's response: "Yes, I would not question the bathroom," is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny stuff "!
