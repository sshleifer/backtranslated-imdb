Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile live actor. English aristocratic snob in "A Room with a View", a passionate Irish thief in "In the Father's Name", an outrageous, violent butcher in New York gangs (ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist) and outraged Cristy Braun with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles influence each other, but each is separate and absolutely unique. He changes completely with each character he accepts. And I start to believe that he can do anything. Everything. <br /> <br /> As Cristy Brown, he is stunning. He does not smile about the character and he does not feel sorry for the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film is an inspiration, despite small scene transitions and the like. Yes, it is predictable. But is that stupid sentimental? I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. A proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant where Cristy discusses painters with Eileen, Peter and their friends. Here Daniel Day-Lewis achieves a theatrical climax. "I'll put you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "Take out the cripple!" And its performance never slows down, never sinks and is beautiful. Easy. He has a lot of time here. I take another look at it and never tire of Cristy's keen eyes, twitching and throaty speeches. <br /> <br /> A must. Fo sho, yo!
