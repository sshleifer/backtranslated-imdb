The story of Antwone Fisher's childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. Antwone never met his father. Growing up with "ecclesiastical" miscreants who use the "n-word" not only for intimidation and injury, but also as an expression of tenderness, as a young man who witnesses his best friend being killed in an outdated, racial treachery Antwone's anger, teased while serving in the Navy, slowly turns into positive power when advised by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life. The scene in which Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the film's most powerful moments. Astonished at the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens silently as the young man tells her how he lived a life without crime, experienced drug addiction, and gave birth to children and children despite his extremely adverse circumstances. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not powerful enough, the next scene will drive her home (and open the floodgates): a reception to welcome Antwone home; Dozens of smiling faces and open arms announce that he is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of this wonderful film is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people who help orphans and help unwanted children. Even if some of the houses and administrators do not seem to care and act independently, many give their best. The character who found Antwone's "file" after announcing the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD contains a French-language title and various subtitle options, as well as additional features and information for parenting. <br /> <br /> As Clevelander, I appreciated the location material. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply touched by this autobiographical gem.
