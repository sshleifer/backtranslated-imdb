When I see a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that the acting is not so good (budget reasons). I expect the lighting is not so good (budget reasons). Stop valuing these low budget movies like a big budget movie !!! I'm a filmmaker myself, so I understand the budget constraints of a low budget movie. Stealing places, taking pictures, etc. ... the list goes on and on. I do not want to say that acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo and Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not yet sold on Carl Washington. He has to understand that every line is not important, some are throwaway lines. I say that if you want to get a movie to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave him an 8th. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work, Quiroz brothers!
