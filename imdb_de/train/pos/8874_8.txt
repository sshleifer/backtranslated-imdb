Higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us who have been in the closet for too long, regardless of their ethnicity. It is an issue that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford it if there is a truly progressive change in the way we embrace and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid, but as a matter of fact. The matter is, ignorance reigns in the world, and some of them continue to help us dominate our society. Everyone involved in this film has done a good deed to show what steps still need to be taken to stop making movies like higher learning.sure sounds like a pipe dream, but we have to start somewhere and that helps.
