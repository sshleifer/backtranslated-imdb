I did not expect much, but I have to admit that I rolled on the floor a couple of times during the movie. If you are not grossly insulted in the first ten minutes, this could be a movie for you. Ditto, if you're the type who would enjoy it, if Amanda Peet mixes cards for one and a half hours. It's certainly not a significant work of comedy, but given the low-budget Indy Genesis, this is masterful. Imagine all the studio films with a budget reduced by a factor of 100 and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network that has gone through this. I'm looking forward to his next effort.
