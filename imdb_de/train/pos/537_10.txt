For me, one thing of life and death is just that - just the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> He radiates class from start to finish. It is stimulating, thought-provoking, a mirror of the post-war world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply mind-blowing and the effect of combining monochrome and technicolor to emphasize the different worlds works seamlessly. The development of the characters and the plot are almost perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've seen it many times - it always touches me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I just kept a movie and watched it again. A matter of life and death would be this movie.
