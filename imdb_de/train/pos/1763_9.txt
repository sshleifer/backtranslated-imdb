This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. It had rough moments, but they were full of charm. It's an old-fashioned script, brilliant physical humor, and relaxed friendships were a joy, and part of the life that most of us can relate to. and I can say with a degree of honesty that I was worried about Steve Carell's nipple ... that's really me. Surprisingly, this is a good-natured, intrepid comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we find on the road. Catherine Keener was as fantastic as Trish and all the friends of Steve Carell were flawed, but gracious and so much fun. The idea that they suspected Carell was a serial killer is a funny metaphor for a forty-year-old maiden. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
