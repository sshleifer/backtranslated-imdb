This movie was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at her peak. In her previous film For Me and My Gal, people often say that she looks emaciated. In this movie she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially at the beginning when it tries to arrange an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion is Judy's interpretation of Lady Macbeth, and when John is looking for her at the party to beat her up (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that it gives them a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, he despises them in a minute, and the next moment they go out on a date when they meet next time they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I did not like was on the opening night. If I were Lily, I would be mad at John, but she is not ... it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But all in all I would have to give this movie a 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
