Has there ever been a more charming movie? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors really seems to interact and affect each other's lives. The focus is on the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along, but who connect as pen pals anonymously. But there are supportive characters as well, and unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail," the latest update to "Shop"), they are not just used for the two leads and their needs. Everyone becomes an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich charm. One of the most heartwarming scenes in film history takes place when the almost tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone with whom he can take the Christmas dinner. Something you must have seen! **** out ****
