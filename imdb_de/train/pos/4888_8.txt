It was just aired on BBC and I am absolutely thrilled to have seen it. When the credits rolled, the cast alone made me try it. After only five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formulaic and predictable, but that somehow added its charm. The flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and experienced a feeling that was the same in a few productions. A real feel-good film, which was permeated by excellent music. When it's published, I'll buy it!
