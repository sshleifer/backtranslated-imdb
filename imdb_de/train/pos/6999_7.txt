Seven Pound Stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has a profound motive to meet those who have fallen behind with their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while talking on the phone, and the film follows his attempt to atone for his truly unforgivable crime. The plot is as subtle as a brick a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening now - even the end of the Titanic was more surprising compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no turn, there is never confusion or doubt about what happens. <br /> <br /> Normally, I only like Will Smith when he is in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is best when carrying a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Hell". Every time he tries to act seriously, he only acts as a pathetic attempt to win an Oscar, which is obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to the movie, even though it is very understated here. There is a bit of comedy, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most unobtrusive performance of Will Smith I've ever seen, and that's why he was fantastic and, ironically, should be nominated for a major award. The side cast was also great - Rosario Dawson looked closely at the entire movie, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were all right where all the other players were playing. It does not throw all the usual clich√©s and sentimental fiddles to give you no choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart was almost broken. It will be hard for you to find none of the situations that are not related to your own life, making it all the more realistic. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. Will Smith's show moves on drama without the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness, and is all the better for her.
