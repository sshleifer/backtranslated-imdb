It took a few episodes to "know" Dark Angel as a story and a series that we've changed quite a different mentality part of The Sopranos from. But once we were done with the core of the series, we were very addictive. It's a shame that the show was ending, when she was just starting to go well in the excellent category: Dark Angel was much more than an average TV series. As for the plot, it's hot and rocking, but the interactions of the characters and the social responses to "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. Keeping the story going in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed on our faces (which does not ruin the "fun" for those who do not want to be taught), but for every event and interaction between man and society remains relevant to the present. We make all judgments, face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question is who you are: Sit back and make up your mind, or get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight to survive or to achieve justice, they are strengthened by this series. For those who had never been put on this issue, "sneaks" this message under the guise of pure action entertainment one. It is much better done and well written than most TV series; I am deeply disappointed when it ended before it could really get going.
