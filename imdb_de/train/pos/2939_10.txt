Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen, and it's a must for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I've seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it, I still have fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you that you have to see it several times to hear all the jokes because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of it! Delirious is weird! <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny comedians who turn out to be second-class citizens after watching this stand-up comedy. If you've never seen it - get it, look at it - and you'll love it !! It will make you scream !!! :-)
