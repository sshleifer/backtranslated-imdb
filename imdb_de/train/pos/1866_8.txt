A great story, based on a true story of a young black man and all the difficulties on the road. Since this is Denzel Washington's very first film to be staged, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical, but who would not? On the other hand, he is a great actor with years of experience, and the end result has been great. The story is narrated in a great way so that you who have had difficulties in your childhood and young adulthood can see themselves in these situations. So it hits you hard and lets you know that you're not the only one going through hell. All in all a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this damned world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film). 8.10
