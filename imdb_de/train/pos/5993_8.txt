The Cure uses voiceover to create an intense mood. Although the VO takes into account all the lines of the film, surprisingly, it does not take the visual story with it. Using multiple movie supplies adds a lot of texture to the story. Choosing the combination of black and white and color worked well to improve the time jumps. The end will make you jump, though you can foretell the outcome. I especially liked the thrill of the movie. The close-ups of the love scene are also charming and reflect a tasteful look. The piece is quite short, but brings a lot. The close-up really helps to show what a short film can do. Worth seeing more than once!
