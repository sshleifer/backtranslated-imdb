This police procedure is no worse than many others of its era and better than some others. Obviously, it follows in the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but emerges as a pleasing programmer. The best part is the unadorned look into a world that is long gone ... the New York subclass of the late 40's / early 50's. Here it is in all its bleak glory, from vintage tattoo shops to cheap hotels to greasy spoons. These old police films are like travel stories from a bygone era and very bittersweet for those who do not like the gentle, soulless cityscape of today. <br /> <br /> Fascinating is also the emphasis on the scientific aspect of solving the crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman was found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the footwork, but without the tedious and laborious efforts of the "lab boys" they would not get anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops here use the persistence of a C.S.I. Investigator to find her husband. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers have written about this film, you think it was staged by Ed Wood and played by extras from his films. What a crap! I enjoyed John Miles when the lanky ex-Navy Cop Cop became Tobin ... He had a happy, easygoing attitude to the role, which is a welcome relief from the usual stony histrionics of most movie cops of the time. Patricia Barry is sweet and adorable like his naughty girlfriend who helps to solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll like the older detective Corrigan. I liked the chemistry of these two more and it did something different than the robotic "dragnet" approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep and the last hunt and shooting certainly will not be among the classics of the thriller, but during its short run, "The Tattooed Stranger" more than interested me.
