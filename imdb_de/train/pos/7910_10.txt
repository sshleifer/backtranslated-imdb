When the first came out, my dad brought it home - we loved it - it was so different from anything we had seen before. I searched for a particular movie last night and found 'The Mind's Eye' again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! These are not graphics looking for Nemo, but still very good. You should resell it - it's a milestone for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
