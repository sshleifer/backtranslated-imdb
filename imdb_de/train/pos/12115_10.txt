Another comment on this film gave the impression that he was miserable. The interviews were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style, which we expected. Still, it's great to see her like that - she's still learning the trade. <br /> <br /> There are so many clich√©s from this film, and it seems that this film has left some marks on it over the next 70 years. My voice is, see it and remember how young this kind of movie was. Stay open and you may be shocked at how disturbed the characters in this picture were, for we were negative in 1934 and, as we find the beginning of the last century intrusive, and commentary on a comment.
