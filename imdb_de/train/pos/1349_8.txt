RKO had the reputation of making rich, self-played pieces of Americana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) has been in movies since childhood. In 1933 she was in limbo - she played Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "Flower Girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Annes work from an earlier movie and so she got this part. She also accepted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat, the "stolen" brooch, the incident "red hair". Anne was right for the role of the talkative, heartwarming orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her eagerness to please and her fiery temperament. O. P. Heggie was wonderful as Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley were well understood as the company Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who also worked as a kid in movies, was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden has proved that she could play another player in the Andy Hardy series than Aunt Millie, was Mrs. Barry.
