All the reviews here, how much ZP is missing plot, the play is made of wood, the Orgieszene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a movie shot in Los Angeles in the intoxicating times of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It's a movie to watch while you focus on psychedelic substances with H-I-G-H. <br /> <br /> Find a kind of bud and smoke, or get a slight acid attack. Seriously, these pure and sober reviews from ZP miss the point. You can not get anything out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Until you saw this movie on the big screen (which I luckily made three times in the 1990s, as) ZP was pretty rare), you have no idea what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching the movie inebriated, you can at least appreciate the end when the crap goes up. Soundtrack from Pink Floyd's Wonderful Review of "Careful with the Ax, Eugene" "Come on, number 51, your time is up."
