I had the opportunity to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This movie remains his wonderful action and great story. If you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture, this is not the case. If you do not have this movie on DVD, this makes the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and the outstanding acting that does not always fit together. That makes this movie an excellent movie. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies, you either get two things. An almost crystal clear picture without distortion or a film with grainy HD image. I was disappointed when I shot my first Blu-Ray movie. I almost began to believe that this is a Blu-ray standard. Although I have seen other films, I know better. I do not think they spent so much time transferring this movie to HD. This is usually the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and the Blue Ray discs, you should only have the best picture. So I think it's just a worthwhile investment for people who either never saw the movie or did not buy the DVD version.
