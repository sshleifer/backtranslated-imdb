While it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, Dudley Moore's portrayal of loveable luscious fabrics, Arthur Bach, has such charm. How can you not be entertained by this contagious laugh and giggle and utter stupidity? Although I'm not a real Liza Minnelli fan, she was really excellent as Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and earned his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also outstanding and the great piece "Arthur's Theme", wow. Actually, this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Great movies get better with each ad, and that's the case with Arthur.
