Shakespeare said that we are actors who are on a grand stage. But if this phase is Israel multiplied the work that we interpret, for ten, and all the actions that we perform, are full of a hard style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of part of Tel Aviv's life, but besides, Katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the Israeli people, and this people is far from being a simple person and speaks from the heart , Katzir's film allows Israel to flee from the dark informative core points in which they live, and this wonderful land appears as a magnificent bird born of its ashes in the light. It is very great for me, because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans know only for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a near and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people looking for their place and the whole explore the state, the whole culture with the sole aim to feel like a part of it. Katzir constructed an absolutely wonderful documentation, and it shows that when a man is filming with passion, the deepest feelings are projected by force and those feelings cross our hearts. Thanks Dan, that you have opened our eyes and give us one of the finest portraits of the most beautiful countries in the world.
