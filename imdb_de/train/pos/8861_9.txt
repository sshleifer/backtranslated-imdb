Andy says, "Nobody gets hurt, everyone wins." Before he says it, we know that the opposite is the case: everyone gets hurt, nobody wins. This is a new beach in American movies or maybe an old beach that was finally brought back. Think of "eastern promises," "there will be blood," "no land for old men." These films are dark, serious, extremely well done and do not worry about a happy ending. I love her. "Before the devil knows that you are dead" fits the general description, but creates a very unique atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie ever to a Greek tragedy. Sidney Lumet honored Stanley Donen, a former director, and skillfully and soberly transformed the grim story into an extraordinary old-school character drama. The opening shots, though by an obese accountant holding his trophy wife in doggy style, look like a painting by a Dutch master. In contrast, the drug dealer's apartment looks more like a series of Mondrians. All around great performances. Only the character Charles of Albert Finney feels a bit over-the-top, the eyes are wide open and the mouth is almost always open. But then he is deeper in trouble than most of us will ever know. As compensation, Marisa Tomei is very hot. Of course, I do not need that. Why her character Gina wants to be with a guy like Andy is never told, but that's okay. Action is still character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
