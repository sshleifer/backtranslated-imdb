There are many reasons to look at this film: to see the reality that Latin America meets in relation to the kidnapping thing, the corruption of the police on a continental level, in so many realities that we live the Latin Americans. <br /> <br /> The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy is still a great actor, and so on. Dakota Fanning has been an excellent actress for only 10 years and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was of wonder, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope that they have happened to Hollywood producers to make a movie completely in Venezuela, where they better show our reality in terms of delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. There were only a few films that they play in Venezuela (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) and they should do more than in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it stays in the soundtrack, it's excellent. My vote is 10/10
