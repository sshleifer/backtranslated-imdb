Classic drama / action western with incredible cinematography far ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and you can say that it was done with pride and love. A unique look into the American pioneers of NORTHT WEST is very educational and entertaining. This film is very undervalued because most people do not enjoy reality so much "Lawmen" were very crooked / corrupt at that time and place, much like most developing countries today. The action sequences could have been more realistic, but still this film really includes the essentials. Not for an audience that just wants pure Testoterone type Westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
