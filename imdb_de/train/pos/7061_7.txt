Of course, the original is better, but that's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was pretty good, to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love. This shows what love can do. The stories were not too bad. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice better here. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I think it sounds better, more beautiful. I also liked her personality here, she had more backbone but was still nice. <br /> <br /> So I will give Cinderella II: Dreams True a 7/10.
