A very entertaining movie where you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not be close to Agatha Christie or Thin Man Mysteries as Film Noir, but it's much more interesting than the typical backstage musical "Boy Meets Girl" or "Let's Show It." As a musical, it's not a Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can enhance the classic "Coctails for two" and the weird "Sweet Marijuana". The film is in real time during a stage show, the opening night of the Vanities, where one murder - and soon another - is discovered behind the scenes. Has the killer been found out before the curtain falls? Sure, but the search is fun, even if it is reasonably predictable and clouded by comic relief (fortunately in the form of the well-formed goddess of the choir girls Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is a bit too sympathetic, the senior lady a little too kind, the bitchy prima donna a little too bitchy, and the in-love waif a bit too intrusive, but as stereotypes, they're pretty stylish. There are a plethora of really great chorus girls who are even better selected than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same era, which are sometimes a bit clumsy. Yeah, this movie could have been a lot better than it is and the Duke Ellington number is an embarrassment, but if you like to immerse yourself in old movies, this will be an extremely tempting journey.
