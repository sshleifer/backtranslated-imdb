I wanted to see this streak in the last few months. I was really surprised how good it was. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a group of high school teens bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly harass him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty terribly burned. Several years later, the group of ruthless teenagers is invited back to their own high school, which is now leaving for a year party. However, none of the reckless teenagers has organized this party. Later in the movie, the teenagers begin to die in the most cruel way. I can certainly tell you that they are also bloody. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you realize that everything was a dream and none of it happened. But Marty is in hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not happen, the burns and the pranks seem to have happened. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is terrible, but that's fine. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really understand Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The mobbers get what ends and you feel satisfied that the victim is getting their sweet revenge /> <br /> I'm giving this movie 8 out of 10 possible stars. Good cheesy Slasher!
