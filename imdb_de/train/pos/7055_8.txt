Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was inspired. I like to write stories myself and hope that children will be encouraged. The three stories are sweet and amusing, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, the Mice Chorus and everyone else. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the governess. A sequel that was made right for a change. My rating 8/10.
