This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series and he is doing well today. Since I can now watch it on DVD and see how it is structured, I am very impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who has directed the good MACHO CALLAHAN and countless TV episodes) murderer's aftermath With a split-screen effect on his two glasses, watch as the murder itself is displayed in a montage style, and watch the view from the corpse's perspective. The wild but impressive avant-garde music of the well-known jazz musician Gil Melle was unbelievable and contributed so much to creating an atmosphere. Brett Halsey's supportive performance as a professional golfer was wonderful - so subtle and complex that nine times out of ten was a one-dimensional clipping. The "formula" had not yet been set when this episode was filmed, so there are still a few surprises in Columbus' methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the actors of the highest quality, and it's a pleasure to see them working - all men are known from many other roles, but lose themselves in their characters here. Overall, this entry in the Columbo series - and MANY among the others - is as good as a very good feature film.
