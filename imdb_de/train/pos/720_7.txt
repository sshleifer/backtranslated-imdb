Imagine what the school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are a big gang, with a really good taste in music and uniting bad school leaders and teachers. In this world the Rock 'N' Roll High School takes place. It's like a Ramones record that comes to life. The characters are all as stupid, innocent and charming as the songs of the Ramones, and the music itself is of course fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years when you compare a movie like "American Pie" to this classic of the late '70s, where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. Since a remake seems to be in the works, the charm of the original is likely to be lost along the way and replaced by vulgar, half-witty tail jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. The main problem, however, will be that the Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this film, and no one else could have come closer to taking their place. The best thing would be to leave the original alone, as quirky and charming as it is. Gabba-Gabba hey!
