If you feel like having fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies you can watch. Amitabh started off pretty well ... but it's Govinda who steals the show from him ... awesome timing and good dialogue ... it's inspired by bad guys ... but it has Indian Masala with it. People think it might be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is directing and acting Govinda should not raise questions ... other recommended films in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda Combo)) ... Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi No. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
