This is a perfect series for families. We gather around the TV to watch BBC America. It is a recent version of Robin Hood and appeals to both children and adults. Our teenager and Tween-Ager both like to sit with mom and dad and watch Robin's next exploits. We can not wait for the next episode to air every week, and we're excited about the free "on demand" view. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a fashionable look. Every story has a moral. It's entertaining. The violence is not exaggerated or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a feeling of John William. It's an old world history, brought back to life with a new world flair. <br /> <br /> There is so much garbage on TV, from the brain that rots the "reality" TV to senseless violence. You should consider this to be what it is and this is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared to the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a gem that can be enjoyed by all. Parents who are worried that their children are watching too much violence will rejoice that Robin has lost his love of war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who tries to get out of disagreement rather than fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Instead of standing and doing nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "night watchman." The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a mix of Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by a very handsome actor who wishes most women he did not play the role of a bad "guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where's Friar Tuck?"
