If you've ever wondered why they do not do porn with an action, then look at Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must acknowledge to Armstrong that you have taken the trouble to use this idea and that you are using such a strong adult plaster to leave some of your name behind. On the other hand, it quickly becomes clear why most pornos never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue to connect sex scenes. These people just can not act (and unfortunately the story is lame to a ridiculous degree). Even so, I gave her a 7 because it was a nice try and there did not seem to be much effort to cut corners. I also want to see more experiments like this. Maybe one day I will see the perfect combination of porn and action.
