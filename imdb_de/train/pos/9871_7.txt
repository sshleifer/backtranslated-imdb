Return to the Lost World was shot in a row with the 1992 release of The Lost World. In this sequel, the same five people led by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has begun drilling for oil, which threatens to destroy the country. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to defeat the drills, and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives. As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber, and that includes a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner repeat their roles as Challenger and Summerlee, and three of the other actors are also back. <br /> <br /> Despite reading some bad reviews and these cheap rubber dinosaurs, I have enjoyed Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
