Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three nineteenth-century soldiers in India who, with the help of a water-boy (Sam Jaffe), liberate the territory from the murderous thug cult. The chemistry between the actors makes this film one of the most entertaining films of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the ejected water boy, who is abused by all but still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Free after Rudyard Kipling's poem. A must for anyone who likes this kind of movie.
