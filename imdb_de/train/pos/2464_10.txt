One of the best movie drama I have ever seen. We do a lot of church work, and this is a resource that highlights all the good things actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must. There are several music scenes. First, the cemetery scene when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows this scene by just going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I suspect that Shakespeare is more attested than anything else. For a second, the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio, and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel really pleased me.
