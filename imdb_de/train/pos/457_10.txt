This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy that I can not get it out of my head. As I get older, I find myself attracted to the wrinkle lovers, get things done, and these four are outstanding in their efforts. Part of what they do is outrageous, but brilliant, considering that in our PC world today, we are never able to do this in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way, and Barney Miller in a different way, how they work and interact with each other. They mess up a lot, but they do the work and that's what counts.
