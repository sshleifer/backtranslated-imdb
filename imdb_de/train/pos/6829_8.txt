Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her influence on reality as she witnesses the death of one of her fans. She is increasingly deceived by reality, and as a result, her emotional uproar enters her work as an actress. In the sense that it breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, it nevertheless manages to thrill its audience, making the film interesting (albeit a little important) as a parallel to Cassavette's own struggles as a filmmaker. There are so many ideas, and as a result it gets a bit confused (I still think about the relationship between the dead fan and Rowlands and many other things), but the way they are presented in their roughest form does it to a thoroughly interesting and thought provoking film. Would be great for a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
