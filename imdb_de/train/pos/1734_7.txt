I saw this movie for the first time ever and I liked it. Her dance was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the role in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. We laughed at the stupid kissing scenes, but that's the beauty of old movies! I grew up with her in the Munsters and like to watch her in her previous films. They may not be all the best out there, but still worth watching to see how she performs and sings. I slowly buy all of her films and look at them while I receive them. I have a large collection of her memorabilia.
