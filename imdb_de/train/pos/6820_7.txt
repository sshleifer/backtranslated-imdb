The movie was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a nice family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally undertakes a journey through time in the old elevator of the house. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearance. She finds a girl of her age and befriends her and can help the girl's family in many ways. She can also help her own relationship with her father in the long term. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a shot and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more geared towards kids ages 6-12 (maybe a bit older), and it's pretty much PG or G rated. I'm an adult who appreciates a nice "family movie" - I guess the other reviewer is not.
