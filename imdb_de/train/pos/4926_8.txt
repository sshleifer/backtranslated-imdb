Elia Kazan, one of the country's best theater directors, showed that he was equally at home with films. With "Panic in the Streets," Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, possibly with his masterpiece "On the Waterfront," though both films only share the water setting, because there are different visions on different topics. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot locally in New Orleans. The adaptation of the stories of Edna and Edward Anhalt, which form the basis of the film, by Daniel Fuchs is remarkable in that it leads us to places that no tourist dared to see on a visit to "The Big Easy". One of the great things about this film is the great black and white camera of Joseph MacDonald, which shows New Orleans at its best. The music of Alfred Newman and the song of Billie Holiday give the presentation a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been filmed in New York or in another northern city because it presents us with the characters speaking more like "broklynese" than maybe a southern accent you in this part could hear of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the movie: Jack Palance making his debut on the screen, the screen is always glimmering you can see him He was so intense! At the same time, this hard guy shows a tender side of him as he visits his sick partner, unknown to him and suffering from a deadly disease. Blackie, consoles this man who caresses his sweaty face and runs his hands through the greasy hair of the dying man. Also noteworthy was the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have done their own stunts, something refreshing because both actors make it seem real. <br /> <br /> The film also shows a normal page introducing the Reed family at the beginning of the movie. We see a family man painting furniture with his little son. Later, he and his wife discuss what it seems they can not do with their salary, which many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person, is not as effective as when this actor plays smarter and more intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes sounds as a wife as a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the director of Kazan and the great cast of the film, the movie is fun.
