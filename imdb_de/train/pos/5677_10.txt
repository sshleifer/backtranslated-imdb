The 3rd and in my opinion the best of the Blackadder series. The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy, who was the funniest character in the previous series, but Hugh Lauries Prinzregent is appropriately crazy line. <br /> <br /> As a package, it's quality through and through, with convincing regency kits, great cut-throat sarcasm, and little crazies, the "macbeth" actors and Prince Georges "Lucky us" chicken impression. and the missing words from Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies were both wise and funny, okay, the weird observation or line comes in, but mostly it's a scream.
