"Girlfight" is much more of a coming-of-age story than a fight movie. And what a relief to have one in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and a credible use of project settings in Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> I realized that almost all Hollywood high school movies are in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even the somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball" that focused on teenage African Americans was set in suburbs.) While these children share some of the same peer-group issues, these problems shrink in comparison to the other struggles of these children who graduated Completed could be the most important achievement of your life. <br /> <br /> The feminist element is intriguing in its originality when you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - and a win - on its terms. Much sympathy for the audience goes to the guy who is challenged to enter a situation in which the gender is. <br /> <br /> The movie here and there is a bit of a draw, but this is not a cheap thrill of "Rocky" combat film, as the practices and struggles are complex and all relationships - especially with fathers and father figures - are more in focus as the middle ring. <br /> <br /> There were many interesting music credits in the end, but I did not really notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10.7.2000)
