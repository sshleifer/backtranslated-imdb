You should not take what I want to say. I have seen many, many films and reviewed many of them in print. If I tell you that this movie has the funniest scene I've ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. There are many disagreements about what makes this INCREDIBLE silly movie as funny as it is. And I can not blame them too much for those who just have not made it. The scene that I'm talking about comes after about 30 minutes and includes a dead convict tied to John Candy. By that time, I found the film dumb and confusing, and it started to lose me. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard that I peed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me before. When the project started, "Going Berserk" should be the SCTV movie. I remember that it was announced. Over time, the cast was reduced to John Candy, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy. There also had to be a regime change at Universal when he was shot, because when he was released, he was shown in almost zero cinemas. When I looked at it a second time, I listened to the theme song (which actually shows how incomprehensible the story is in the lyrics), relaxed my logic and found out what was going on. Apart from the above routine, "Going Berserk" has many other funny scenes that can recommend it. This is almost a 3-stooges strip, except it's a lot funnier. Director David Steinberg has an exact timing, and he must have laughed all this. As for Candy, who is mainly responsible here, he was NEVER funny. Since all action devices and explanatory scenes are thrown out the window, he is absolutely wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is an act, but it is an act like "Animal House" had an act, and yes, the script is uneven and a little slow to start. But if you know this, you can see the full craziness of the SCTV style. It's stupid, but it's deliberately stupid, and you have to remember it when you see it. See it and discover for yourself if it contains the funniest scene ever.
