The most famous film by Depardieu is this (1974) groundbreaking film by Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes reminiscent of an X rating, including one by Jeanne Moreau, who performs a hot version of her Jules and Jim from the 1970s with the two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no sacred territory in this film. Everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It's very strange that Americans do not like this movie very much, while many French people I've met consider it a classic. Something against that is in contrast to what Americans have programmed to 'like'. <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two sloppy, hippy drifters with lots of sexual insecurities. They are looking forward to kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro-Commie, Slacker "Freedom". Blier mocks the hell out of these two guys, while at the same time bourgeois society itself looks a lot more ridiculous. Best of all, however, is the way the wonderful Stephane Grappelli score conveys the troubled soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious, or the "higher ideal," which motivates all the madnesses they employ.
