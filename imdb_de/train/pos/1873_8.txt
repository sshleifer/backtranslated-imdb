The violent and rebellious twenty-five-year-old sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) meets for three sessions with marine psychiatrist Dr. Marine. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) sent for another outbreak and an aggression against a parent naval man. At the beginning of the treatment he hesitates. Trusting Davenport reveals his childhood and reveals painful traumas that arise in his nursing home. In the meantime, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love. Antwone solves his personal problems and becomes a new man. This true family drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent. She makes a story about child abuse sensitive, attractive and with good taste. It could be a very difficult story in the hands of another director. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Return to Life')
