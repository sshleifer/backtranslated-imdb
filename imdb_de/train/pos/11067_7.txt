At the end of the movie I still do not know if I liked it or not. That was the case with most reviewers. Still, I still feel that the movie is worth a 7 to the effort. <br /> <br /> A long time ago I read a quote: THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF SCRIPTURES, 1. THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE. AND 2. WRITE THIS LETTER AND THE READERS. While I am here, I feel that GUY Ritchie has taken this path too literally, leaving all the thought to the public. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with THE DEVILS ADVOCATE and FIGHT CLUB. It's definitely a classic: something no one understands but appreciates .... <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is why Stathom (Jake Green) had a blackout (that's how it all started), all Puzzles and secrets of the movie were done except this one here. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're reading this review to find the solution, like this movie was all about: I'm posting the very midnight that I notice, and if you still decide to watch this movie or not: then answer first .... if you encounter a riddle labeled "nobody has ever solved" would you like to try? I would <br /> <br />
