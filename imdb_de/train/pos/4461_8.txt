I really liked this movie. I've seen several Gene Kelly strips, and this is one of his best. I would actually put it over his more famous American in Paris. It sometimes seems like the story in Gene Kelly's movies is lost through the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.
