An excellent series, which has masterfully acted and directed, but is not loved by Mr. Deighton (I am told) and withdrawn from him after a single presentation. It is only available in private collections and on request from the British Film Institute. Too bad, because Ian Holm's nuanced portrayal of the tired but determined Bernard Samson is outstanding; one of his best achievements. The minor cast, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, is outstanding. With Mel Martin, who plays the conflict-ridden and treacherous woman, and Michael Degen as Mercurial Werner, the story seethes positively with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the big game.
