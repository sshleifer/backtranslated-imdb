An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man who goes insane. With chronic insomnia, Jack is plagued by hallucinations; He causes him to try to find out what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We learn interesting things about Jack in the end and think that when the movie is over, the movie will be "happy." This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (writer and director) herself has a good movie in "An Insomniac's Nightmare" talented filmmaker and author (she made this movie just after her high school degree), she has real potential and will see it in the near future. <br /> <br /> When I saw this short film, I was always there Uncomfortable: between the music, the dark scenery and the realistic representation of an insomnia by Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I really wanted to switch it off to avoid escaping.
