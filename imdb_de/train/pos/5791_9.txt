This is one of my favorite episodes from the Twilight Zone, especially for depicting two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> Cobweb-strewn shops and rubble-strewn streets are scary Twilight Zone is the best place to do that. <br /> <br /> Although the parable can be a bit cumbersome by today's drama standards, it is an excellent thing - it uses the attitude to make a statement that is relevant to the human experience as well as geopolitics timeless. The entire drama rests exclusively on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, which does not disappoint. (May both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
