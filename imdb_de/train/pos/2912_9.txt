We're over-throwing the term "superstar" these days, but here's a guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was connected to the set throughout the show. The selection of songs was perfect - it contained only the songs I really wanted to hear and cut the documentary material during the weaker new songs. I loved the fact that the band was only five people on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength you do not need a circus to be entertained.) <br /> <br /> The shots of the crowd were also fantastic. How many performers can impact the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s and beyond), get young kids to rise in the opening lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and influence everyone in between? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that Paul McCartney became an afterthought following John Lennon's tragic death. Not only did Paul lose John and George (regardless of their final relationships, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to really get the recognition, the Lennons murder had received. I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was somehow forgotten in the episode. I was very happy that he found love in Heather again. <br /> <br /> As for the complaints about the audio / video quality, I had no complaints. both were crystal clear on my set. I think these people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out. You will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> I just regret that I did not buy a ticket for this show when I had the opportunity. Thanks to this video I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will first be remembered for his music. Let's hope another madman will not change that, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
