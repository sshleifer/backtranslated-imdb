This is a film about Italian artists of the 17th century and in particular an artist, a woman Artemisia, an unprecedented profession for women at that time, and she dared to paint the male act, detailing his unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The camera work is mainly indoors, because the artists worked mainly there. There are some great shots. Close-up shots of candlelight suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters, and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students paint them through elaborate scaffolding in details of religious frescoes. Not surprisingly, the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, make-up) are very authentic as the Italian churches have kept all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is urged by her father to study with the great Florentine artist Tassi, who has developed into an expert in perspective art and landscape painting (something very new), but the unsuspecting Artemisia is not only introduced to new painting techniques. After posing for her, Tassi violently rapes her. Her father is outraged. Legal proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a pretty simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women walking across a field while the wind stirs up their voluminous clothes add wonderful effects. Artemisia says she paints to please herself; Her father paints to please others. As for this movie, I like it the most, I think.
