I read a book by Nancy Drew about 20 years ago. So much of my memory of the fictional character is probably flawed. From what I've collected, the books have been introduced to me in an era of teenage childhood (back then, in the '80s and early' 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and, of course, Carolyn Keene's Nancy Drew more famous. I still remember those hardcover books with very old cover illustrations, which are usually pretty heavy (for a kid) to lug around, and the thickness of the book, which may be attributable to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts , <br /> <br /> Well, the character got some updates along the way, as I remember the following Nancy Drew books from my sister getting less fat, from softcover, with updated and a chic Nancy on the cover , I can not remember if these stories were the same as the old hardcover, but I think those books written in ghostwriting have their fair share of updating for the time being. <br /> <br /> In this release by Warner Brothers By Nancy Drew, the character undoubtedly receives an update for the time, but somehow the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen have retained their 50-year-old small-town sensibilities and a certain charm and taste that people like me would appreciate. Her fashion awareness, her prim and propiness, even some peculiar little behavioral traits that make her good, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Her family background is more or less the same as living with her single father, Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who is moving his daughter and herself into the big city to create better job opportunities and omit his daughter in the town of River Heights. Mom is just a distant memory, and the maid makes a cameo. But what Nancy Drew did to do is to cast Emma Roberts in the lead role. Niece of her famous Aunt Julia, she too has that sparkling demeanor, that distinctive red hair and that megawatt smile. Your Nancy Drew, while at first you seem to rub it the wrong way, will actually grow on you. And in almost what I considered a discarded scene of Pretty Woman, the characters had to go with almost opposite reactions in a posh store. <br /> <br /> While Dad Carson Drew is doing everything he can to get Nancy out of her sleep To get into a normal teenage life, trust Nancy to be in a house owned by a Hollywood guy was found murdered under suspicious circumstances. Mystery Solving is her consolation when she finds herself an outsider to the local Brotherhood, not long before we take her on her big screen adventure. <br /> <br /> There's nothing like black dahlia crime and mystery, and instead it's a pretty simple piece for Nancy, between Corky (Josh Flitter), a chubby school friend, and satisfying jealous friend Ned (Max Thieriot ) to find a friendship while he hides the truth about her extra activities in the curriculum of her dad. The story is full of cheese fun and an oldie sentimentality that enchants, and together it becomes a bit like Scooby-Doo. With minimal force and without major shootings or explosions, this is a serious genre that is clearly marked with the words "chick strip". <br /> <br /> I think the movie will generate a new generation of fans who are rekindling memories of old ones, and probably just likely, could trigger a new fashion trend from sporting penny-loafers.
