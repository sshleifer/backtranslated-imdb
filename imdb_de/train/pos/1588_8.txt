What I like about SPOILERS Teen Holly Tyler lives with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; But she does not know half of the crazy things that will happen to her from now on, and not only with her, but also with her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), her boyfriend Henry (Michael) McMillian, annihilates Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's friend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter, then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you have a funny one Have bones in your body, please skip this. If you only like a sophisticated comedy, this is not for you. If you like a fun, sometimes touching show with two hot girls who can play the lead (and none other than the fabulous 'Mary Cherry' by Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), what are you waiting for? ? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
