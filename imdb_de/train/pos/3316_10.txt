Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her everything every time she is on stage. Whether we laugh at their jokes and antics or dab our eyes at the tension of one of their formidable ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. It is interesting to see how incredibly her voice has changed over the years, but never lost its power. Her "vocally more correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses any of the spirit of THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS. I will appreciate this concert for a very long time.
