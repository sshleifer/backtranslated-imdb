The 60s are a balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries we follow a North American family with three members. But we do not just see them. We also follow the story of several characters as black reverend, extremist student leader and soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters we see some pictures of the Vietnam war between the scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one ended. It starts some time later and gives us a little puzzle about what happened. In general, the 60s mini-series is a must, not only for hippie fanatics, but also for those who are less concerned with the subject.
