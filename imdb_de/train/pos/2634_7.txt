Lion King 1 1/2 is a very funny and captivating sequel. Do not expect the production values ​​of a cinema release, but expect the highest quality of direct video publishing. <br /> <br /> Timon & Pumba is set up when Timon & Pumba begin to see the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly change lanes and begin to tell their own story. This happens with frequent comedic interruptions. For example, during a certain tense moment, a home-shopping commercial jumps in and Pumba realizes he's on the remote. These little moments nurture the movie, and whether you find it entertaining or not depends heavily on your humor. If you are particularly bothered by movies that purposely remind the viewer that he is watching a movie, this may not be up to you. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best thing they have invested in the Disney DTV series and is almost seamlessly integrated with the original material. The newer, independent material uses much artistic style of the original. The vocal talents are all well done, although every time I heard Julie Kavner I thought of Marge Simpson. Many of the jokes in the film are recognized by viewers as being recycled generations, but rather presented with the familiarity of the comfortable idiosyncrasies of old friends as annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> The music has shown me how much I was happy and misses a good musical, which is integrated with a Disney feature. The opening feature "Dig A Tunnel" is well choreographed and hilarious. Timon and Pumba attack the opening sequence of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise is also amusing. The only problem was the reprise of the "Dig A Tunnel" at the end of the film, which transformed the text and melody from defeatist to edifying. <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is almost perfect, though the last piece during the Hyena Pursuit has stretched the plot's credibility somewhat. The new story does not seem to deal well with saccharine or emotionally charged moments, and it's better to resort to full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, worth a purchase. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then opt for it. If the Penny Pincher is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until he drops four or more dollars and hire him right away. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
