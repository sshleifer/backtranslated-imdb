The authors Perry and Randy Howze have written a very gripping little story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> With the idea of ​​a born-again man returning to his former wife's home many years later, the plot takes on unexpected, sexy twists. <br /> <br /> Fourteen-year-old Robert Downey Jr. Jr. performs well, supporting Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper and plays with a graceful style. I have watched this movie several times on television and always found it very enjoyable.
