This is a nice drama and a nice change from the hectic and louder films of today. It's another solid store based on a real deal, which means much of it could be caught up for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I do not know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a fifties young man who is interested in rocketry and wants to enter this field instead of working in the coal mines. Like everyone else, including his father, in this West town Virginia. The big problem is the conflict between the boy and his father, which in my opinion was exaggerated. I would like to have less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first star jobs, I think. He is sympathetic, just like his classmates here. It's nice to see beautiful kids in a modern movie. The other two main actors in the film are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher, who constantly encourages him). <br /> <br /> The cinematography is decent. The soundtrack of the 1950s is fun. Again: I wish there more such films.
