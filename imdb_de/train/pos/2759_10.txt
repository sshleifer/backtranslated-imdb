I have few tears in my eyes when I watch a movie. And I only cried once when I saw this movie. This movie has a few clichés, but I really do not care. I'm crying, even though I'm writing this, and it's been some time since I saw it. It plays perfectly and all production values ​​are good, but what really counts is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love, we really live. I know how sentimental I sound and I promise that I'm not usually like that. I'm pretty cynical. This movie has made me feel stronger in grief and happiness than in any other movie. It will probably always be the first movie I recommend to others.
