It's a story that could have taken place anywhere in the right circumstances. Street entertainer caught the attention of the famous opera star and the subsequent friendship. The aging entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass on his art. From there we follow them through the hardships of their demanding but free life along the river. He travels from city to city, he performs and has a certain reputation. Despite the time and influences, the man is nice and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the services are first class, especially Xu Zhu, who represents the street artist. The kid (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and very strong and stands the obvious prejudices well. The two protagonists, along with the support of the friendly opera singer Master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), tell a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the distant similarities of this film to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); However, this film can not endure easily, any similarity is at best far away. <br /> <br /> My only problem with the KING OF MASKS is the end. It was weak, a clich√© and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The audience was already packed into the story, what the unnecessary manipulation served? Too bad. To get a fine movie that way, just to indulge in such emotional (and crazy) pathos. To be honest, this movie did a good job, instead of the classic it should have been. Apart from that, the KING OF MASKS is still worth your time. I was happy to see that the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.
