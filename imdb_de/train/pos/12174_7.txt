I think the deal with this movie is that it has about two minutes of really funny moments and is a very good trailer, and many people came up with the expectations of the trailer and this time the movie does not do justice to the trailer. It's a bit slower and slowing down for such an exciting premise, and I think I see in the comments that people have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look I think in this movie what it is and not what it could have been in terms of the talent of the cast, I think it is still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so dizzy and carefree that she puts herself under the compliance of everyone else, she simply glows and the entire audience falls in love with her with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled colleagues, his elegant mother-in-law, his friendly boyfriend Jim, and his future bride are all great at adapting to the stereotypes of conformity and boredom that make Stiles stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee can not keep up with his costs, I do not think, but you could call that something more difficult to fulfill. Maybe that's a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite some slowness and a few jokes that are not as funny as the author intended, is still pretty funny and I found it more of an intelligent movie. The issues of conformity and "walking the safe path" seemed to be cleverly aligned on several levels. For example, there was the whole motive of imagining scenarios, but never getting involved until the last scene, or listening to a radio program on the highway, talking about how everyone adjusts, or how it all works with Selma Blair and The Characters of Julia Stiles said and did that they were repeated by a person's motives as a sure and a risky decision. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about the movie was that it was a kind of screw comedy in which Jason Lee had to make his way through the film and that by dumb luck (example: the pharmacist turned out to be good Koch has pointed out) and some wisdom in turn for the most part gets on with it. <br /> <br /> It was not as funny as I expected, and there was a bit of wasted talent, but overall it's still a good movie.
