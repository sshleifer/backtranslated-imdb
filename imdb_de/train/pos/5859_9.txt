This cool Marvel superhero game is a real tribute, staying true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that were so lame with faint graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improved in both divisions. It also contains the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. He does more than just cobwebs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. If he does not use a net in battle, he hits and hits as well. Spidey has his hands full as he fights Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus is fighting, just to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most levels are challenging, but some of them need patience to beat them. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a true Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but do not expect a long gameplay. Good luck in "Spiderman 2". My rating: 9 out of 10.
