The movie "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones drives the viewer on a journey of salvation, while the main character takes back control of the bike and puts his life in order. Adam Jones has found a resourceful and refreshing way to strengthen his character and update the essentials. These truths become visible to both the characters and the audience as they laugh and talk to them. The simple but attractive settings \ costumes will let you guess what you will see next. They can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this film. I can not wait for him to try his second year. It's only a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
