Esther Williams gets her first post-MGM starring role and starts well. This movie is a well-maintained suspense <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that would be repeated millions of times in the future. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great and if she wanted, she could probably have made more and better films, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> pretty much gave up working for the marriage. Either way, she is so gracious and captivating that it's fun to see her in a completely different role outside the 'swimming musical'. Universal was fabulous for making <br /> <br /> movies with former MGM stars after the studio started. <br /> <br /> dropped his biggest names as he slid down the hill. Stars <br /> <br /> such as Lana Turner, June Allyson, and others were allowed to make first-class movies at Universal, as they apparently still had drawing power at the box office. I wish Esther had done more, but since she did not, that makes it all the more special.
