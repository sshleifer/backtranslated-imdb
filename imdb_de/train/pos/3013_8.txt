The talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) is breaking off his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut-off and parched suicide case that he thinks is really much more, a rather complex murder! <br /> <br /> When it comes to murder mystery movies, it just does not get any better than this one. Filled with suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all having a good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim, Archer Coe, it's really hard to figure that out or wrap your head around, boy, it's fascinating Unfold to watch in front of us. Even the Cops, the Coroner, and the district attorney are colorful characters who add an unexpected, pithy realism to the process, adding to its overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the comic scenes with the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), which is rudely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during that time. Also, the Detective Sgt. From Eugene Palette Heath offers welcome, often later at his expense ravishingly humorous, critical comments during the investigation of Vance. I can not come up with any valid criticism to actually give this movie, except maybe that it's not very well dated. The movie will not be just fun. Watch if you can envelop this mystery. Highly recommended, try it!
