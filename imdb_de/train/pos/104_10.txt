This film had an interesting cast, it had no cunning cast, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I am glad that we have b-grade films like these. The story is basic. The actors are simple. And the way they do it, you do not need a million dollar budget to create a movie that consists only of a mix of b-actors and actors a basic conspiracy I really like the way they set the road for themselves had alone and that there was no one around, and what I also found interesting, is that they have not closed a caf√© to walk the corridor, and that they have done everything from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen have excellently portrayed their role in the hostage-taking. This was a great movie and I hope to see more of it in the near future.
