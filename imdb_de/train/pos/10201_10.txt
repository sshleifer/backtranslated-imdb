It's a very good movie, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated films / series of adventure and fantasy. The film is about an innocent girl being killed for something she did not do, but for who she is, the daughter of the lord of hell, Lucifer herself. Then she seeks revenge ... and the rest is better seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics and make mess. I never had a chance to read the first parts of the story in comics, just the last of the passages in the film. So I can not tell you if the events are just like the comics, but ... in one direction or another is the story of Lady Death!
