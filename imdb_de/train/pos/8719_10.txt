I was amazed at the improvements of an animation movie. When you are near the screen, you see the details in the grass and surface textures. The details, colors and shades are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. I will never know how they got the shade. I hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary about the film production so that I can find out how it was done. Based on this movie, I think that animation films of the future will be judged by this movie.
