Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York, saying he would make a living from being a stud. He comes there and quickly realizes that it will not be easy - he is experiencing one humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope, he hangs together with the crippled, run-down Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and leave the city and move to Florida. But will they succeed? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing and yet fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger draws a very dirty portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. That way, it's outdated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it's cleared up a lot now. He also uses every camera trick in the book - color turns black and white; trippy dream sequences; flashing forward; Flashbacks (especially rape); Shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you name it. It keeps you disoriented and not in the middle - but I could not stop looking. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a story - it's essentially about the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the last shot shows that). It's just a portrait of two injured characters trying to survive in a cold, gruesome, urban jungle. <br /> <br /> This was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason was that the MPAA did not want to think about parents seeing their children. Nevertheless, it was a great success among high school students (at that time, X meant that no one was under 17 years old). It was also the only X-rated film ever to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight were available for the acting award, as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the (maybe) 5 minutes altogether! It was eventually lowered to a R (without cuts) when it was reissued in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin '" was featured in this movie - and became a big hit. <br /> A great movie - but very dark. I give it a 10. Do not see it on commercial TV - it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.
