This is a beautiful movie. The images of the Mexican desert, the old manor house, the figures in their picturesque costumes ... all are a real work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a bit loose, but she does not mean to be realistic. It comes from a book entitled "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and is meant to be a reminder of the isolated, otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". The enormous debt that Erendira owes her grandmother is a symbol of the international debt burden of Latin America, although there are many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate a slow, richly textured movie then this is the case for you
