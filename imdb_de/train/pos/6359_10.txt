If you went to this movie to see a big Academy Awards ... well ... but if you wanted to see a fun, adorable adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it. Jim Carey was amazing as always. The story was great, adding a few pieces as the story of Grinch did even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat. But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage, this is probably a children's or family show. Try not to lose sight of that. If you really do not enjoy the movie ... and as for the comments on Ron Howard, try showing a big movie and see how you do that ...
