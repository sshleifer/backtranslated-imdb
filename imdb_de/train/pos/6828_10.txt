Broadway and director John Cassavetes (by Rosemary's Baby) create a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It features Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert and Laura Johnson. There is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands) reevaluates her life after an obsessed fan died in a car crash and tried to get her autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It looks like a movie from the 60s and even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has - she's getting old and she's becoming useless in her career. She also feels she has lived a life that lacks true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has only lived for her career - she has no children, does no charity work, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She falls apart. She is in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the tortured psyche of the character and plays the role pretty well. She is a terrific actress and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the era and the disaster films or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with a lot of deep emotions, but it has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes criticized the mainstream 70s movies and actors. Either that or this movie is a product of the '70s, which in many ways was itself cynical - Nixon's Deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great and this movie is not known, it is a very haunting movie with a ghostly vibe , Kudos to the underrated and deceased director Cassavetes, who died in the late 1980s.
