I saw this movie for the first time in the eighties, but now the thriller is still up to date. Some newer films focus on similar topics, but do not fit this French milestone. <br /> <br /> A president - apparently JF Kennedy - is shot dead in a public car during a public appearance. The resulting major investigation found the "Lee Harvey Oswald" character of this film guilty, but a jury member insists on further investigation. He reveals some surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this movie does not play with emotion, but focuses on an exciting description of a plot and how it all fits together, draw a new picture of the murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more sensible, smarter and more exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many recent films, I had a kind of Deja Vu, who sometimes sat in the cinema. <br/> <br/> "I ... comme Icare" is a must. It is unique and brilliant and the music of Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good ranking. If it was a Hollywood production, that would surely be famous. <br /> <br />
