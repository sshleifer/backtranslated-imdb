I say the domino principle is a hugely underrated film. Anyone who has taken the time to examine our contemporary history of conspiracies can only conclude that the author of the domino is the author of the Domino Principle really knew what he was talking about. Roy Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer, maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh. to name a few is not really a fiction, but a threatening part of our tangled existential history. Help us, but the domino principle is more a fact than a fantasy. If this leads to a slight sleep loss, it should perhaps not accept my word, investigate for yourself.
