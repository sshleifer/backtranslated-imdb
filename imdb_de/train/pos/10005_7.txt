Yes, it's an art ... to make a slow thriller successful. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in beautiful volumes, while you do not even notice. <br /> <br /> Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the movie may seem unnecessary and may affect how much you like the movie. The core diagram, however, is very appealing. The movie does not rush on you and still holds you so tight you can wonder. The direction is good. The use of lights to achieve the desired effects of tension and unexpectedness is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice 1 time, if you want to sit back and listen to an exciting short story!
