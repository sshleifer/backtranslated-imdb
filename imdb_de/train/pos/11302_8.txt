Oh, those sneaky Italians. It is not the first time that they have made a film of source material without the permission or knowledge of, in this case, author of the novel. Of course, this is not typically Italian, but much was done in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they could get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this film out of the US screens until 1976, but the film itself has become a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as great as the American 1946 version, but it's still a great movie. Of course, this is not least because the movie is a great, strong story that is intriguing and gives the movie some great characters and realism. It pretty much follows the novel and is therefore largely the same as other movie versions of its story, except that it plays in an Italian setting. <br /> <br /> Let the Italians make a movie about life and the real people. These early dramas always have a very realistic feel and are therefore very interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power towards the end when the film felt a bit overlapping and sometimes tore. The film could easily have ended 15 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> Still, I do not have much of a negative for this movie. It's just a great material based on an equally great and strong source material. An impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to make many other great and memorable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
