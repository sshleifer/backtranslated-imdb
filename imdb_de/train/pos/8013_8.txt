Yes, it is another great magical movie by Muppet and I adore them all; the characters, the movies, the TV series episodes (it's the best comedy or musical television series ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they have made such a rare, fatal mistake, and I am certainly talking about the weird ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to include so much in the American drama and end a love affair by marrying !! We, like all poor onlookers, feel so free or perhaps happy that there is no trouble, drowsiness and misery. We all enjoy these stories in which two cute heroes come together as a couple in love, without having the rightful connection like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess and so on. I bet all previous couples and their preferences make you feel secure, relaxed and peaceful. So if you see what the creators of this movie have already done, you'll be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> They made the weak, wretched being (Kermit) marry his daily nightmare, the most annoying woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change through the actions of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the audience who simply refused to bless, believe or be content with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the right opportunity to think or to decide!). No wonder, then, if you know that this movie is the worst movie in your movie theater. He earns only 25 million euros compared to 65 million euros, the first (The Muppet Movie 1979) earned five years earlier. <br /> <br /> In this movie they just took Manhattan and also my rest!
