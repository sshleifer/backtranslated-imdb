John Turturro once again proves his amazing versatility. He plays the introspective Russian chess genius, prepares for a comeback tournament and makes an unusual relationship with a Gadabout roommate (Emily Watson) in an Italian 1920s hotel. They fall in love, to the horror of their mother, the mountaineer (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story whose brilliance makes chess seem cerebral. But despite its origins in a Nabakov story, this is certainly not the case. The romantic elements and the sense of time and place completely negate the psychological analysis. John Turturro, appeared in "Barton Fink," "O brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not need Coen Bros films to maintain his size.
