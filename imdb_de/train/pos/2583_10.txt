The best games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the conspiracy. That's the hint! This is a private property built as a private company. This is a self-destructive and self-organized conspiracy. Finally, the scenario described the perfect professional conspiracy: private, self-organized, self-defeating, and without a trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. Everything can only be done by delegation. The "director" only has to trigger. If the ordinary viewer can not recognize the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a true plot has less chance of being discovered. All appearances by the actors are well done, with special mention being given to Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
