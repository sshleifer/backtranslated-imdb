It took time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I remember that I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to get down to business. I've seen it a few times recently and now I know I was wrong. Today, I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, the whole feel of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and blood. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night his crazy brother comes home to end what he started 15 years ago. This movie should be scary and I think he succeeds very well. It's also one of the first Slasher movies, a horror subgenre that I've always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, scary music and talented young actors like Jamie Lee Curtis in their first role. Do I have to say more? Anyone who has never seen it, horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework. We recommend!
