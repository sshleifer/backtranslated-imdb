"The Lion King" is without doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought I should give the sequels a chance and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and had a lot of fun with Timon and Pumba. Only a problem, I think, sometimes no explanations are needed, because they can create plotting holes and only the feeling of wanting their own explanation. Well, I would recommend this movie for Lion King fans or just for a night out with the family. It's a funny movie with the same laugh and lovable characters as the first one. Hopefully I'll get the same with the third part of the Lion King series. Lean back and just think of Hakuna Matata! It does not mean worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
