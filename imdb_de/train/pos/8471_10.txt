This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos and I have seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming self, as Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a wonderfully crazy museum curator, the usual comic reliefs are pretty funny here and there are many suspects who need to take a look. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have exactly the same flair as Thomas Beck, the usual second advantage of these programmers, but it is appropriate. Stepin Fetchit is aboard, and while he's stereotyping, his lines are humorous, not demeaning to his intelligence, and he's actually saving the day in his short time on the screen.
