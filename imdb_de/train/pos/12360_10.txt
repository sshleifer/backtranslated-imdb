I loved the movie. It miraculously analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society, as the leftists of the 70s have abandoned all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement that they do not want disturbed. For example, the aging psychoanalyst, who is jealous of his own son and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> He wanted to buy the video for a long time after watching the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy nobody knew in the bookstores of the movie. a great pity. <br /> <br /> The only sex scene that everyone seems to talk about does not hurt the movie.
