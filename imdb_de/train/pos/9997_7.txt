Life Stinks (1991) was one of the other productions of Mel Brooks. He plays a starring role as a rich man making a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live like a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" at the Bowery, he meets some weird homeless people, one of whom feels like doing so (Lesley-Ann Warren). They make friends as she teaches him the many tricks she learned on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive on his own without the luxury of being dirty rich? Will he win this unorthodox bet? Who are his true friends? Find out if you see LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie was wrongly faked. Sure, it's not a classic like his previous films, but it's still fun. I liked how Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've seen Chaplin's earlier silent films, you'll also get the humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
