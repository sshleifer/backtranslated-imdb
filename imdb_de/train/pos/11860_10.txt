This movie has everything. It is a classic account of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of thousands who have a chance to determine his fate in America. Amazing is this cinematic, but extremely accurate representation of Miami's Drug Empire. Brian DePalma does amazing work in directing this image, so much so that the viewer deals with both the plot and every character in the cast. Given the credibility and strength of Tony's characters, Brian DePalma has released the talent of Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Franks Mrs). I enjoyed every minute to watch this movie and still watch it weekly. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic mystery story, I am firmly convinced that people will still refer to this film in astonishing numbers in another 20 years. Since other crime films are so dramatic, I find that this movie is a shock to the system.
