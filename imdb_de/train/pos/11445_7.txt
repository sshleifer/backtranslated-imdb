Rivers and Tides is a new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work. Fans can see his work on the move. When you watch Goldsworthy build his pieces, you develop an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspire and influence his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most Goldsworthy pieces (no snowballs), I think it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life and created a beautiful movie that was a joy to watch.
