This was an absolute must for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004 so I would definitely watch the replay. I really sympathized with the main character of the movie, because the skin problem he had is mild, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (wasting the voice muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see his terrible condition and pull off his bandages. Jonny had a rather naughty sense of humor, he even told the otherworld when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model and Jonny's supporter Nell McAndrew. It won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factual) and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and the Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A Documentary!
