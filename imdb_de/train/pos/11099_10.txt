Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos. Invigorating performances, rock-solid writing, and great music make up what is probably the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All performers are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have earned every inch of these Emmys. If you doubt it, you only have to try a few episodes. especially from the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely wild, absolutely scary and you still love him - fascinated by him. <br /> <br /> Many people I've talked to about The Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) say, "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows." What ever. Run - do not go - and get it. The same people usually love "E.R.", but I bet they do not really care about hospitals ... It's not about the context.
