In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who's stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who would win a fight. Sometimes we become absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we are talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison to see that Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you follow what we saw of Let Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to at least say that he would keep up well with Chan. In this movie, he looks like a martial arts god. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man who was created with many other men as the ultimate fighting machine. Their sole purpose is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. Well, that's the premise for the movie, but that creates all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with and on his body that no one can do. And that's exactly what makes him so funny. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strong in humor and that's because of the chemistry Jet has with his co-star, the police officer. They are great together. But to be honest. If anyone reads this review, he wants to know if the movie in the action section is totally crazy. And the answer is a clear YES !!! Many, many bloody, thoughtless action. You will love this movie.
