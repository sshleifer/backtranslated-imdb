Included: Buried Alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is scheduled to close soon. <br /> <br /> We start with a man who gets going and drifts up in the air to avoid avalanches. somehow it makes no sense. Anyway, he's about to destroy a particularly large one when he realizes that the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, the higher authority tells him that his day is over. Soon, as everyone expected, an avalanche comes in. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not going to reveal anything anymore. I can only say that this is a B-movie for the Family Channel (which I just saw, and the fact that he had no ads, proves that it is a B-movie). It's a pretty decent movie, but it's partly unreal. <br /> <br /> Firsthand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not just tracked by powder. or how about a CD for a screwdriver? it is not possible. And finally, I can not stress enough that an explosion can not stop an avalanche. <br /> <br /> It's also worth borrowing or watching TV without owning it. 10.7. <br /> <br /> The film is classified as PG, but maybe he should have gotten something stronger. A boy almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around his ankle, a guy is roasted by electricity and diesel, and dead people are lying around in the weight room. <br /> <br /> enjoy.
