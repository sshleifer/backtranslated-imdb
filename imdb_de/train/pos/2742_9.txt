Richard Brooks' excellent 1967 film about Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect accompaniment to Philip Seymour Hoffman's 2005 CAPOTE Oscar winner. They play really well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find films that are so well interlinked every 38 years. These two are really improving. Although several actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces mix well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name than Capote. I would suggest seeing CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes a powerful experience!
