Recently my kids started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes of the N and the later ones of ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not know that the show had even survived the first or second season.) I'm curious what prompted the cast change. I've seen that they were described as "highly publicized" and still searched for half an hour. Efforts on the Internet have only yielded endless commentary on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I do not see much of a difference - the scripts and themes remain essentially the same - but they lose some great people along the way.) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the country is all special features and that Comments lit up. I also wish they had self-referential humor about the changes - like "Boy Meets World," where they take their little sister off for an entire season or so, and if another actor plays them later, they ask her where she was and she says "up" or when the early serial geek "Minkus" appears for the high school diploma, they ask him where he's been and he says "over there", pointing to the part of the classroom that was never shown before Camera, before saying, "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running off the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who has left) Well - maybe there will be an E-true Hollywood story about it or something? I was just glad to see that Aunt Hilda showed up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - too bad it could not have been a more complete cast. (The Zelda candle just did not cut it for me)
