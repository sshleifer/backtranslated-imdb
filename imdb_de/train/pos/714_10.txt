Even if you are not a big fan of Ramones, Rock'n'Roll High School is still * the * biggest * rock'n'roll movie ever made. Why? Because under all the campiness, he treats contempt and despicable teens with respect and feels (and rightly so) the boring, stupid, fascist, established world of adults. This last scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes of a movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen the glory of ..." Rock'n'Roll! <br /> <br />
