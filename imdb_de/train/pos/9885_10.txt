The young Erendira and her Tyrran grandmother provide a great fantasy from the new world. This interpretation by Gabriel Garcia Marquez "The history and history of Er√©ndira, ..." must not rub Marquez purists in the right way, although the story remains intact and still bears the full force of the work. The strength of this film lies in his acting, especially Papa's as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez newbies will enjoy this movie for its real, witty brand witt.
