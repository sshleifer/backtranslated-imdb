It is not a big movie. Acting is not amazing (some subcharterers are even poorly played). The movie is not beautiful in any way. Nothing really imaginative or new. If you like big movies, this one is not for you. but it has a big - really big plus in the story. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we did not ask for an appointment, the test we failed, the friend we let down, is everything in our story. This movie works because it is touched. It's a great story because it's a little one. It is the life that we all have, with regret that we all have, and yet the message is that every life we ​​could have had its drawback. The first time I saw it, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a party in my school. 16 years later, I keep thinking about it, and every time I see it, I put a smile on my face. Look at it. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
