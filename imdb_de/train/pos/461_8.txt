Since this movie has many good entertainment qualities, it should, in my opinion, deserve more recognition than was stated on imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "who did it?" Thriller with sex and murder, but it lets you guess until the end. I like this kind of movies and I think this movie meets the standard. <br /> <br /> This has been worth more than once for me, so I'll give him an 8 on imdb.
