Bellocchio calls this a mainly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but that seems to be more of a metaphor than reality. Well, almost everything in the movie looks like a metaphor. The revolutionaries we see about and from whom we learn very little could also be mobsters. Out with the old and pure with the new. <br /> <br /> Andrea's dad, a psychoanalyst, seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally upright, unwavering, clean and tidy, thoroughly ritualized. <BR /> <br /> Giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs a cause for support very badly, but is unable to muster the kind of dedication that one has Obligation requires. (I suspect here.) Andrea, the adolescent boy, seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not restless "upatz." He is respectful to his father, but also disobedient. He loves Giullia, or so we suppose, although he's not really old enough to learn how to do his reflexes optimally, but he's leaving her to attend school and pass his final exams. His course between these conflicting lifestyles could be described as "media". He is the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep quiet while people are screaming around him. <br /> <br /> Most of this will be summed up during the verbal part of his finale when asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from "Antigone," which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the idea of ​​secularism and free will , <br /> <br /> This brings us - by no means, that I am aware of - Marushka Detmars. It is reminiscent of a New York cartoon from a few years ago. Two hippos are deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the shore, and one hippo says, "I hate them." She is a good actress. (Let me get that out of the way.) But everyone else in the movie. She carries in her speech and manner the rich glitter of madness. And all that comes from the actress, not the director. Detmars is not crazy about how crazy Catherine DeNeuve was in "Repulsion". The walls do not turn into rubber and grow on the hands. Instead, we see them animated - sometimes TOO animated. And it gives us shocking shocks when their mood changes abruptly and threatens the threat of thunderstorms. One critic described her as sultry, but that was probably not the word he was looking for. She is adorable with her fluffy brown hair, her broad, white, ready grin and her impulsive giggle. And her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one is explicit, but because we got to know the characters involved. (It's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than to go to a strip of skin.) Actually, there is not that much sex. There is only one scene with simulated intercourse, but the director lets it run in a seemingly real time. At least in real time for an eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also fine, which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost exclusively on him and Giullia. You have to wear it and do it too. Without their performances, I would not be sure if that would be as interesting or as admirable as it is. It could easily have become a rather slow, boring romance. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
