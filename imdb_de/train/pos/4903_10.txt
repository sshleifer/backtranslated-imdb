At least a little bit inspired by the Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who played at the Covent Garden Opera throughout the war years, this film records the efforts of an older saxophonist to reform the (almost) all female band she played with Schoolgirl towards the end of World War II. Too short flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us wonderful music and help the band members to complement the background and especially the girls' relationship with the only male member - their transvestite drummer (who tries to be) - compliment the call) , <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench perform in outstanding performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth and the captivating, happy female Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as leader of the band, who now plays bar piano on the ocean, and June Whitfield glows as trombonist of the Salvation Army. Cameo performances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is an exciting memory trail with an all-star cast of everything that should really be a bunch of actresses over the mountain. I can only say, I hope, I look just as good at her age! Especially Leslie Caron is still an incredible fox at the age of 69. It will certainly get my pulse going! When I saw it, I cursed the casting director for not using women of the right age. After that, I looked at these girls and found that each of them was old enough to perform in London in 1944 (though that could be a bit boring for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing bands, nostalgia, or just want to see how well a woman with almost three quarters of a century can look after her, you should not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
