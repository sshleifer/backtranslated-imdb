A fantasy is a terrible thing to lose ... especially if you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not waste time setting aside the viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shares an apartment with a slob will cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a chambermaid is putting a ticket on your windshield will just scream. We all wanted to rip off a terrible toupee for a man. These are just a few excerpts from "Cross Eyed," a heartfelt movie that should be a springboard for Jones and his dry humor in front of and behind the camera.
