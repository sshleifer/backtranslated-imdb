Alain Delon visits the reckless crime family who hired him as a batsman in the Duccio Tessari thriller "Big Guns" after he had accidentally murdered his wife and child. Tessari and the scenists Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "One Minute to Pray, One Second to Die" and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" bring this actioner through a career shooter for the mob to the wire rope. In fact, "Big Guns" is pretty predictable, but it's still a solid conversation with many wild and often sudden murders. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is accordingly laconic in methodically handing death to the heads of the mob families who refuse to let him retire so that he can enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian criminal who wants to bury the hatchet with the Delon character, but the rest of his hard-working co-workers want the batsman to be dead. Like most thriller thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" has signed cinematic morality that does not pay for crime. Interestingly, he survives a man who has nothing to do with the murder of the hero's wife and son while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up. Apart from the mother and son who died in a car bomb for the father, the worst thing that happens in a car junkyard happens when a hero's employee is crushed in a scrap car. Allegedly, "Big Guns" is a pretty bloodless trip, but for a gangster melodrama from 1973, it has a high body count. Only at the last minute does our protagonist lose his vigilance, and so the constructed moral of an eye is preserved for one eye. Tessari makes some decent chases, and the death of a Don on a train passing through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn. The photography and the compositions are excellent.
