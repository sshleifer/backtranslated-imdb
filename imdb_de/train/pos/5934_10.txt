Sorry, I have no idea what Hollywood does. Surely give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, I think Hollywood covers the story in the movie Batman, but please do not entertain us what we really want when Batman and Superman are together. I really hated this trailer because I wanted more. I looked around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible joke. The graphics that made the story look good seemed solid and had everything that made a great movie. Unfortunately, it will not happen for the time being. Great work for the producers, directors and all the actors, but I hate you for doing that to me. You let me want more.
