The thief of Baghdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it's a good story. Although my four children are primarily from this story, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, by the Disney Corporation, the thief of Baghdad has aroused their interest until the very end. The story moves at a good pace and includes one or two phrases that reduce predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, can also think of one of today's youthful actors when he says how many times my eldest daughter has heard, "He's c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won Oscars for Cinematography and Special Effects. Of course, these effects seem very outdated today ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," my daughter said flying at the sight of the genius). Nevertheless, they fit well into the story. After all, the movie is over 60 years old. The effects match the script. What's seen in The Thief of Baghdad will be state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. Just compare the opening assembly from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. This was quite a achievement. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie, although there are some stitches at the end. The spectacle is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless that these scenes are almost as artificial as animations. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun movie for an evening of entertainment or the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
