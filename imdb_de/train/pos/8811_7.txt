Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world gather in this film to present their views and ideas on the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll see in every movie. Films like this are rarely made and appreciated. This movie tries to touch any core of WTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the movie that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where the attacks from America are being prepared somewhere in Iran. There, a teacher tries to teach her students by informing them about innocent people killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt), in which a filmmaker meets with a dead soldier from the WTC attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in a WTC attack. Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of Five Innocent children sees Osama bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), where you see a black screen, and slowly you see the real shots of the WTC buildings. And the people stuck in the building jump off to save their lives. The other main story comes from Mira Nair (India), where a mother struggles to get respect for her dead son, whose name is falsely trapped in the WTC massacre! After the Sept. 11 attack, when we hear two names around the world, our heartbeat starts to pump automatically. First, World Trade Center and Osama! This film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves such a Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. Please do not expect more than movies on this DVD. Of course there are filmographies of the filmmakers, but no additional features.
