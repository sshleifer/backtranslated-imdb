Barman judged Any Way the Wind Blows as if singing a Deaus song. Anarchy rules over a logical and common direction of thought. The story behind this movie goes in every direction that the wind blows. And that can be really refreshing when you are ready and willing. Viewers who claim that there is nothing that holds the story together are right. Who the hell is this windman ever? Nevertheless, I really liked this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, bustling place where Any Way clings. It also captures the stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, dependencies and violence that live undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining, funny and a bit flat. Barman's screen debut will not be as strong as his music debut. In this light, some could be disappointed. On the other hand, "Worst Case Scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind.
