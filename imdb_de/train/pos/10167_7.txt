I was not a fan of seeing this movie, but when my friend called me and said she had a free advanced screening passport, I just looked in to see Eva Longoria and laugh at Jason Bigg's antics Overall, it was actually better than I expected, but not much. It was like a mixture of a guy losing a guy in 10 days and heaven. a typical romantic comedy with her moments, I think. The movie was quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, develop character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a spirit pursuing its former husband was an interesting plan. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm, and Paul Rudd and the rest of the minor cast (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laugh going at a gentle pace. I had a lot of laughter to keep myself running I rated this movie lower. Hey, this is a chick movie and I check this movie from a man's perspective, it would be a fair fight for women to review this movie and think about it.
