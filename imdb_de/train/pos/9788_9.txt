I was at the same script writer conference and saw the movie. I thought the author - Sue Smith - was very clear about what the movie was about. The movie really needed no explanation. I thought the topics were pretty clear and inspiring. A film that deals with the ability to dare, to face fear - especially that transmitted by parenting figures - and to overcome them, embracing the possibilities of life, is a movie that can be appreciated and enjoyed. I enjoyed it much more than the much hyped "Somersault". I also think that Mandy62 Hugo Weaving was a bit rude. As a guy about his vintage I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been lacking lately, but "Peaches" delivers the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
