Rarely does one encounter a film that is as flawless as this one. It's really one of the best-played, best-structured films I've ever seen. Each dialog line can be interpreted in different ways, referring to the three main characters. The film is a web of motivations and double crosses that you want to capture and not let go. In addition, the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything celluloid ever did, and you've got the ingredients for a perfect movie. It shows the romance of films like "Titanic" as the banal clich√©s that they are. If you are looking for a movie while folding your clothes, this is not the case. You have to commit to this movie. You can not talk while you walk in and out of the room. This movie demands your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you will get a lot of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the best movie ever.
