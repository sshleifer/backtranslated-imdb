BABY FACE is a fast, wise, cracking, knowing grin of a movie that takes <br /> <br /> only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes they are! That a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a short time shames most filmmakers today. Today, scriptwriters from <br /> <br /> should study the economics of BABY FACE and quell the bloating that overwhelms so many of their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. An amoral woman first gets up, <br /> <br /> and then over the bodies of the men who immortally fall in love with her, happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it's not hard to see In which direction the authors wanted to go <br /> <br />, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is great, as well as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as a hapless worshiper. Not a great movie, but certainly a pleasing one. If you've never <br /> <br /> seen BABY FACE next time on the cable <br /> <br /> or borrowed the cassette. Well worth the effort ..
