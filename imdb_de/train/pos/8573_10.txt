In the 101 Dalmatians of 1996, Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police for trying to steal and kill 101 puppies - Dalmatians. Everything covered with mud and hay she spent the next 4 years in the "tin can". Well, 4 years later, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years. So, in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic movie, called "102 Dalmatians". There is a 102nd Dalmatian who has been added to the family (oddball is the name, I think, I should know, as it was just shown on TV), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! While Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) fled again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - once again made of puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song from the 70's. And now we hear a bit of it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a great movie that I'm always wondering - WHEN WILL I BE A "103 DALMATIANS"? "LOL <br /> 10 stars
