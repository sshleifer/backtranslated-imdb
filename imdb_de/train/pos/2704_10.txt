I am disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation of this film. Once again, Billy Zane proves that he is more than just a handsome Hollywood boy, in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with subtle pathos. To call this a silent movie is inaccurate as there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic pace and is full of the stupid ingenuity for which Ed Wood is finally appreciated. Take a look at the cast list and see that everyone is shining. Nobody is just there to show their face. I think they are all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood, and to show a broad, physical way of acting that is not much to see today as a hit, much more than an aesthetic appreciation for one Show movie. And IWUETDID has no identifiable target audience. It was mostly made for the love of Wood's screenplay. Even after his death, the trendy social parasites have dealt him another heavy blow and deprived the world of a little classic. This is a very entertaining and really experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
