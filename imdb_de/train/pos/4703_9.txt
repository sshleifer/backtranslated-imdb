This movie is totally funny. His cast immediately clicks Frame One and leads us to a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster movies. The conflict between brother and brother occurs when Johnny's brother is a Do-Gooder D.A. becomes. However, the best character is Johnny's crimelord rival, the overly accented Moroni. As Johnny says, "This man should be arrested for slaughtering the English language." <br /> <br /> Watch the video. It's worth a look.
