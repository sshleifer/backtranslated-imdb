Sure, this was a remake of a '70s movie, but it had the excitement and action of a recent movie, Breakdown says. He runs desperately with his wife in the hospital, the police are the least worried. The chases were very good, the part where he was cornered at a rest area was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. That's better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car prosecution that was filmed badly? Vigo's character knew what he needed to do to escape Johnny Law, few movies had the effect night vision, CB radio. Okay, I forgot the name of the movie. The end is great, you can not say if he faked his suicide or not, a very good deed that he or she would not do.
