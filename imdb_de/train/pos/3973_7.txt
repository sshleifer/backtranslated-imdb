This is a fun "story" from the FBI, but it should be considered a fiction because that's what it is. What else could it be when J. Edgar Hoover personally took on the role of cameo? As always, James Stewart is excellent and the understudy except the talentless Vera Miles is good. Murray Hamilton is particularly good at supporting role as partner and best friend of Stewart. The FBI achievements highlighted by the film are undoubtedly all true. The essence is what it lacks. <br /> <br /> One of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the death of John Dillinger. It's pretty much portrayed as it happened, but Melvin Purvis, the head of the Chicago office that led the operation, is not mentioned at all. Instead, the operation is presented as if it were executed by the fictitious Chip Hardesty. It was said that Hoover was jealous of the public that Purvis received after Dill's death; Purvis was later transferred to a remote outpost and left shortly after the FBI. This is undoubtedly the reason why Purvis was never mentioned in the film. But this spectator at least paused to think that if Purvis were treated this way, the agents would take on all the other scenes depicted in the film. Were they completely ignored and replaced by the fictitious Hardesty. The film is probably accurate in its depiction of FBI activity until the end of World War II. After this point, however, the film would make us believe that the only threat to the US stemmed from international communism, which Hoover undoubtedly believed. Does not matter to the mafia. No matter what lynchings there were in the South. No matter that blacks were intimidated to keep them from voting in much of the South. I do not know if the FBI intercepted Martin Luther King at the time this movie was made, but if not, it was not long after that it started. <br /> <br /> At first, this is a pretty good conversation, but it should be considered the redeveloped fiction that it is.
