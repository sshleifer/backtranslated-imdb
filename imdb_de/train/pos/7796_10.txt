This was the first movie I saw Ashley Judd in and the first movie I ever said of Victor Nunez and I'm glad I did that. The calm tone, the relaxed tempo, the realistic portrayal of a young woman who has just started in life, the delicate portrayal of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark on life, the people she meets - There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's so close to the film magic I've ever seen outside the Star Wars movies, and considering how these films look, this movie really deserves a high rating. The acting of Ashley Judds, Mr. Nunez, and their 'great, simple, worthwhile story make this story a beautiful story and a wonderful movie.
