Okay, this movie has probably earned 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to make up for the misleading rating of the handful of Bozos who gave this film 0 or 1 star ratings. Each of the segments for this anthology offers great potential and promising potential for talented filmmakers ... Three of them have achieved notable success in major Hollywood productions. The performances range from rough to quite impressive, with noteworthy twists and turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. As a psychotic hypnotist, Martin Kove may be a great melodramatic with the bizarre strobe lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally muted as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But overall, it has some great laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
