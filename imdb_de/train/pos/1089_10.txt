This movie was shot in 1948, but it still sounds today. Very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country, and from there it "builds". Anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very adorable. Great cast Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are adorable in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 1940s. Clothing, architecture and family life. Many references relate to the cost of things, and these comparisons with today's costs are quite amazing. I can not imagine that someone does not fully enjoy this movie. I'm surprised how many middle-aged people have never heard of it. A true classic.
