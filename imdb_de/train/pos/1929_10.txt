I recently had the pleasure of watching The Big Bad Swim on Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, and I have to say, it's the best movie I've seen all year, and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to comment or review. This film was wonderfully staged and combined a script with realistic dialogues, excellent acting and an inspiring message. Ordinary lives unite in an adult swimming class and become extraordinary to celebrate the diversity of life. This is shown by the images in the first minute of this fascinating film, in which only the legs and torso of individuals of various shapes and sizes penetrate into a pool of water. This film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in fascinating scenes that hold your attention and imagination.
