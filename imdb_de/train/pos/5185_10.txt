I have seen this movie over 100-200 times and I love it every time I look at it. Yes, it can be very hackneyed, but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The camp shown in the movie is a real camp that I have actually visited for 7 years and is really portrayed as a camp, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever gone to camp, visited a camp, or sent a child to camp should see this movie because it brings wonderful memories to you and your children.
