Is it a good idea to use live animals for store windows in department stores? No, and here's the reason why ... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" the sale, the bugs help to promote is over and the store manager (Nelson) puts him in a new department: the Taxidermy. Of course, bugs objects and the fun starts. <br /> <br /> With just about every section of the store (children's clothing, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightgowns - do not ask.), bugs come at the top of every turn, even as manager "The Great GilderSNEY". Even though it is trapped within the bounds of an elevator, Bugs makes the most of the situation. <br /> <br /> Director Jones is always on top of his image game, as are Blanc (as Bugs, Natch) and Nelson (the manager - who sounds like a radio station Gildersleeves - ask your grandparents. <br /> <br /> And a wise piece of advice: When faced with a fuzzy-looking woman who always wants to try bathing shoes Check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument yet for animal laws.
