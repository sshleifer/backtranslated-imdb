13 days to Glory tells the traditional story with sympathy for the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this film was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie convincingly, the remaining names of cast members Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity due to the professional soldier who eventually won the battle. The scene in which he insults his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a shooter, the scriptwriters did not understand. Not to keep in mind is a major problem of the military. Santa Anna was under his prerogative to be angry. Raul Julia wore wonderfully bad writing by the scene. <br /> <br/> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have been reminded that Dickinson's who came from Pennsylvania probably did not sound very much like Southron.
