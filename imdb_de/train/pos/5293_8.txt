This is a very carefree comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker because he uses Peck for his food. Pecker loves to take all sorts of photos of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md., And manages to attract the attention of a group of New York City photo-art lovers. Pecker has a sweet sister who just makes SUGAR crazy and actually is an ADDICT who gets a spoonful of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men showing the lumps in their jockeys with grinding motions and girls doing the same. It's pretty hard to clear your mind with this movie, but who cares? It's just a movie that gives you a simple picture of 1998.
