This movie is so old that I never knew how young Ray Milland looked in 1936. I remember him playing Lost Weekend in a great movie. Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about the split between father and mother, and they learn that their father is going to marry a young blonde who is a gold digger and is just looking for a rich sugar daddy. They hire a man who presents himself as a very rich count. His name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer), who is drunk the whole time and is destitute and makes a lot of funny laughs in the whole picture. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star, and then Penny sings with the most fantastic soprano voice I've ever heard, the entire police department, and The Convicted started to applaud, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this movie. This is the first movie debut of Deanna Durbin. She became an instant success overnight and became a great movie star at Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
