Usually I'm not on a particular show (except The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But no kidding, after an episode of Reunion I was addicted. <br /> <br / I can not even say how annoyed I was that Bush's speech last night was in time trouble because I was really looking forward to the episode of 1987, which will air on next Thursday. This conflict was again detrimental, as he has to build a following as a new show and the second episode is postponed a week, which brings some momentum. <br /> <br /> That said, TV does not always have to be Emmy to be worthy. I do not expect Reunion to take any prizes home, but I expect it will grab my attention throughout the season. Do you watch the first episodes of a popular show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever became addicted. Creating characters takes some time. <br /> <br /> The one episode for each year is wonderful in my opinion. The only other show I can remember is 24, with each episode being an hour ... and having a busy year is more realistic than an eventful day! Please give this show a chance. Relax about art form ... it's just TV!
