I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a depiction of the period of separation. The movie has been haunting me for many days. Urmila played the role of her life in this film. She put life into the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai played no less in his role as Rashid. It is hard to imagine that except for the two, the role of Puroo and Rashid will be taken over. The Punjabi costumes looked so natural on Urmila, and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did an excellent job. Priyanshu Chattarjee has done a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some scenes you just can not get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. The climax is just a killer. I expected a tragic end, but thankfully the end was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Not to be missed.
