I can barely remember this show, but I remembered it was great! My oldest brother reminded me of the show recently, and I had seen an advertisement for the D.V.D set appear. The network that screwed up again to take it out of the air so they could put something else in their place? It should have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not right? I sometimes think that network executives think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they suspect and miss a good show placement from time to time. It should be said that they have many more flops than hits. This was one of the bad decisions to step out of the line-up. Anyway, I get that for my collection.
