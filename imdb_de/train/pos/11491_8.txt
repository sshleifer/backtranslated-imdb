The unborn child is a completely different movie. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the movie and they played pretty well. This movie is solid and keeps you busy. Although I think that you have to be a horror fan to see this because of the scenes and the plot. There is a short sex scene without nudity that could have been left out, and for some people this scene could disappoint someone like me who is interested in the movie and thinks that the stuff is ruining a good movie. There's a scene where Adam's character goes crazy and kills a cat, but you can say it's not real. The music is very different, but very good. In my opinion, the unborn child is a really scary movie that is unpredictable and pretty weird! I recommend all horror fans for this movie!
