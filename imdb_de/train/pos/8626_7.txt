"The Deathking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you funny? Jörg Buttgereits second cult monument in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "Necromancy", consists of seven short episodes? one for each day of the week? revolves around suicides of independent people. Between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit adds truly frightening pictures of a hard-to-disintegrate male corpse. The episodes are not all equally strong, but as a whole, "The Deathking" tops the list of all the most oppressive art-house films of all time. Wednesday's episodes, in which a man explains his sexual frustration to a complete stranger in the park, and Sunday, which focuses on a younger man harassing himself to death, are extremely intense and devastating. The added value of this movie or other shocking movie is controversial, and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit could communicate some kind of message here or not. There is a vague mention of a sinister chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but most of the time we remain uninformed about their motivation to end their lives so dramatically. Quite different from what I expected, "The Deathking" is neither exploitative nor repulsive graphic! On the contrary, I could never have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful in terms of portraying pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly displays various views of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of the people who have jumped appear on the screen. The production values ​​are inevitably bad and the cut is often lacking in professionalism, but that's not what really counts in this cinema. The topic is strong and forces us to think about the less cheerful. but also indispensable? Aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music too!
