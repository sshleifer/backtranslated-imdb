This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I rated it at 10. The story is about the famous "Bushwhackers" from Missouri, who fought between the states on the southern side during the war. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was one of the battles that did not happen ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well-staffed and either the most brilliant actors, or the director really knows how to make the most of them. I guess it was a combination of great directing, great casting to find the right people, and excellent performances by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie was really worth it! It has action, romance, excitement, good and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history in one movie. Even the future spiderman and the jewel. And she is good!
