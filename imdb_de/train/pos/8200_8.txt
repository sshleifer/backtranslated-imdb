Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better films than these, but this does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry attracts everyone's attention and there is no reason why you do not like him. He's cool because he's dirty, is great, because he kills without much thought is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I have In the movies in which Eastwood appears, the character of the main role always fascinates the audience. In White Hunter Black Heart he is the crazy director, in "The Line of Fire" he is the "old" Un, while here is the "almost" unemployed with his work, that is, he makes himself work, It He does not care if his superiors practically send him on holiday. <br /> <br /> Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all "no-nonsense" movie viewers However, what is a little inferior to Eastwood's better films is that although the character of the lead role is intriguing, it is not, as this is far too obvious right from the beginning puts you in a place without moving, there are too many people who are much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
