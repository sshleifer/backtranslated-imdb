I saw this movie as a kid and broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished ending ... I grew up with many great anime films and this was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness and cruelty, loneliness and life and choice can not Undo the need for others. Chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is alone when Chirin follows him into the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, though every night he says, "Maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The band I have is broken and broken down by age and use. I'll fix it and eventually watch the movie again and cry the same way as a kid. Stories like this, with that depth and feeling and complexity of meaning are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never met a nicer catharsis. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
