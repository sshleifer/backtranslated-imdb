I have seen this movie twice within a week and can only summarize it in one word (which I usually can not use easily): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie of all time. Who deserves Oscars and other accolades, if not this Swedish crew who created cinematic perfection in the final scenes of the film, when all that is said (and unsaid) is collected throughout history? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so many feelings and long-suppressed emotions in the people around him, the film does the same thing to its viewers: they walk with their heads offended and full of heart. Great stuff! Next time you ask, "What is the meaning of life," you might be thinking about how you feel after a precious experience, as it is in heaven: happy, satisfied, fulfilled. To tell Virginia Woolf's wife Dalloway, "Such moments are enough."
