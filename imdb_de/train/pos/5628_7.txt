After watching some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way - the beautiful "victim" and the handsome, obviously extremely "off-center" worker, the main actor (if only just "totally confused") ") - alternately the Breaking up hell, like in a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. <br /> <br /> That's fine, and of course that's basically a "turning the tables." Story, but I'm referring to the director's firm conviction was to show Farrah's well-known and obvious physical qualities, starting with her tempting clothes in a thin robe and a series of scenes that were more than necessary for dramatic effects - while they are immensely pleasing to the eyes, they draw attention from the intensity of the Dramas off. <br /> <br / I'm sure their roommates are doing performances like writing and conducting - but their skepticism and their yells and sobs do not sound right Based on Farrah's previous experience with this guy, there are rooms with the most evil intentions, and she has absolutely no reason to exaggerate what happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie and a story that both despite and because of the work of the director.
