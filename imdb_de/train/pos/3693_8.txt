It's not easy to create a movie with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors have accepted the challenge, not all of them are good, some even boring. But in his entity "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, which shows that, as "Love Actually" puts it, "love is everywhere", especially in the city of love. Here is a CV (I try to be as free of spoilers as possible) from the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - a kind of boring opening sequence, nothing really special. A man finds a parking lot and sees many strange couples passing by asking why he can not find a girl. And then suddenly a woman faints beside his car. <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence about three teenagers who are looking for a 'donkey' when suddenly a Muslim girl drives right in front of them and gets help from one of the boys. Really simple, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br/> LES MARAIS - that was a huge disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with artistic background from the great Van Sant could have been interesting. After all, everything that comes after Ulliel's monologue is good, everything, before it just sucks. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without saying a word - is intriguing and the whole sequence is just funny. He made me addictive until the very end, and it really gets you into the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story, even if the execution is bad, the heart is there. It is the story of a Hispanic woman dropping off her baby early in the morning to look after another baby in the suburbs. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment must be the strangest and weirdest of the entire movie. A kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown-like place in Paris. If I understand correctly, it's the inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a really wonderful sequence. A man meets with his wife in a restaurant to part with her so he can run away with his mistress. But the woman has devastating news. Pretty simple, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - also a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother. One night she wakes up to hear her dead child. When she gets there, a cowboy tells her that she can say goodbye to her child. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been great, but though she does have some nice tricks in the movies, the story is not intriguing and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a true original and great sequence, one of the best in the film! A young girl and an elderly man are discussing their future and their fears for a particular man ... Cuaron is doing a great job and the actors are amazing! QUARTER OF THE ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. again a beautiful segment with a very sad end PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts to talk romantic with her ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very headlong and unromantic Pigalle is a failure. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - QdlM brings variety to the movie and is a relief. A young man (Wood) finds a vampire who kills a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Madeleine is dark, scary and weirdly romantic and is great. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another disappointing segment. Directed by Wes Craven and stars like Mortimer and Sewell it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is just ordinary and not at all original Short film is beautiful, gorgeous and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that she breaks up with him. He reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> LATEST Latin - Although this segment was co-managed by Depardieu and has stars like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also disappointing. Nothing happens, there is a lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14TH ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American woman talks about her trip to Paris in her French lessons. Her French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment she realizes that Paris is so much more than it seems. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone that will not let me down even though some segments bore me to hell, the essence of the movie is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
