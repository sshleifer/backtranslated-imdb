The thicker the drama, the better the movie of sister's rivalry! This little gem was mainly advertised as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I am glad that this was not the case. There are certainly fun little things about small towns, but the drama is the focus as the story progresses. And not just a family drama, but also raises fierce questions to respect the different life choices of the people. <br /> <br /> Great character ensemble with many great and moving dramatic scenes that earn credibility points. and they are not just a scatter, but hold on tight. I just assume that if Ingmar Bergman had done this (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably have been instant. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
