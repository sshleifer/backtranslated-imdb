This would have worked much better if it had been done as "Mitchell in Malta". At least we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale in this ridiculous-looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention acting like an old West gunfighter. Since Mitchell Mitchell was, the film would not have suffered from unfounded police brutality. Well. At least the funny comments from Mike and the bots made this pleasure as a result of MST. But I can not imagine seeing it alone.
