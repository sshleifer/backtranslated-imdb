For those who may not know what a one-actor movie was, this is the best example. This conspiracy is ridiculous and really makes no sense. It's full of clich√©, creepy lines, melodrama, comedy ... you name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can make everything convincing, and this movie is no exception. Everyone turns to a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But the megastar overshadows everyone with its formidable presence. Without him, this film would not have been a beginning ... The story is about separation / false identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs. Evil - really everything! Amitabh's is a brilliant performance in an otherwise stupid movie! And did I mention that it is ridiculously funny?
