This is a very good movie produced for the TV movie. It shows problems in the suburbs of 1970 and the kind of neighbors you certainly do not want. The worst and most exciting part of the movie was when the punk teens killed the family dog. The young people are doing everything they can to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy, the main character in the end avenged the punk teenagers. The father / homeowner certainly takes the punk teenagers not too much trouble and can quickly revenge for lack of help from the police. He faces himself and protects his home and his family. A very good actor ... I could add. <br /> <br /> I saw this on TV when I was 8 or 9 years old. I have never seen it on TV and I would like to do it. Definitely a good one! It's a kind of movie that can be seen very late at night on a weekday, and can not stop watching an afternoon movie on a weekend. It's the kind they just do not show anymore. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing!
