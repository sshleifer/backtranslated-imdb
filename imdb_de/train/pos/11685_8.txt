I found this movie very funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent to Earth in a white body from the 1950s. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continues to behave as before. He listens to rap music, sings and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this film was to watch the difficulties it brings to the black community through this behavior.
