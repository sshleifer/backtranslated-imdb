Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of hitting, stinging and shooting (but do not worry, the lead is a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent move through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in the city, to kill a lawyer. Although he is dirty from his journey, he almost immediately sits at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds unlikely to you, you should probably avoid this movie. It was my impulse to stop the disbelief, and I had a lot more fun doing it. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, nervous policeman who likes to play with people as much as he likes to smoke. Wai goes a fine line, which is investigated by Internal Affairs, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south (which implies that Wai rap his father for his own corrupt business There are car accidents, many murders and a strange and unpleasant love story that is almost comic-style, and I suspect the humor was deliberate (nobody uses gigantic concrete billets without an eye for the extravagant Absurd), even though the exaggerated nature has lost some of my fellow travelers, there are at least three points the movie may have ended in, and in 109 minutes it may have benefited from reckless editing or been deleted from one of the narrative strands (the light-hearted stuff is good works, so I would have omitted it.) the interactions with the three fathers). <br /> <br /> I tend to give him a (high) pass, if only because of the end ?? I've rarely heard so many people laugh so loud, which should have been a poignant moment. This is one you can see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
