I say no matter how hard I look, I will never find a better movie version of "Othello". If you love the great masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado About Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), I'm absolutely sure that you'll find "Othello" by Oliver Parker irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has played several roles during his career. He was great in "Boys and the Hood" (1991). I have always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles to be his greatest achievement. Of course, that was long before I saw that. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and is probably the most challenging role of his entire career, but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Irene Jacob is absolutely enchanting Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in a fascinating role of the crooked, manipulated villains Iago of history. The wonderful "Othello" belongs to the absolute elite of Shakespeare's ingenious works. It covers his favorite topics: crookedness, envy, deceit and jealousy. This movie is certainly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, based on William Shakespeare's drama.
