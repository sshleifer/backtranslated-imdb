It's about Mitzi. I loved her in it. And did not she look fantastic ?! I love these Lifetime Sunday popcorn movies. This is like one of the nail biter, where they always go to advertising at the most annoying times. The Richard character was completely scary. I met such guys. Well, not quite so lol. I wish Zack had not been killed. He was a sweet and very eyes. I love these stalker stories. I always have to get up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband does not usually like these kinds of movies, but he's been through the whole thing with me and really enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi is doing next!
