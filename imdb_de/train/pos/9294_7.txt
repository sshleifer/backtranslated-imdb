Before I start, I have to point out that I know the publisher of this movie. We've never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (the things that came before the message boards), and we talked on the phone, so I have a prejudice here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow it's ironic, like the "rat pack" culture of the late 50's and early to mid 60's in the mid 90's making a comeback of this movie from the son of one of the original Rat Packs that was similarly made was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop. I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not brutalize this (he gave a mixed review, as I recall). And although I do not think this is the best movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack or cocktail culture, I think it's worth a visit. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it looks stylish and is making good progress. On the other hand, the core services are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly reluctant because the gangster returns from a sanatorium, and he has a quirky advantage. Jeff Goldblum goes back to softly ironic appearances that he had given in his time before the blockbuster like THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin only vampires in this film, she makes it entertaining. Granted, it's not a great movie; The dialogue is mostly wordplay, and many of them do not work (like the entire "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. I was entertained anyway, and if you like gangster movies, maybe you're there too.
