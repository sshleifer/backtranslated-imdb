I absolutely loved this show. I have seen it from the first broadcast in the late '90s to the last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show that you could see with a friend or your kids. Yes, Jo has changed a bit since we last saw her in the books, but it's still fascinating with great stories and good lessons. The actress, who portrays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke), does a wonderful job, as does the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we see the romance between Jo and Nick, as well as the daily stories and lessons children and students learn. I can recommend this show to anyone.
