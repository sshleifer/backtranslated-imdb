This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents "a story in a story". The protagonist is the scriptwriter Bart Klever, who persistently struggles with his new text? this is also the script of the movie we see. In the film, Bart plays a scriptwriter who writes the film's script? Barts fight with the text becomes a narrative subject, as well as the environment of the apartment in which he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers many possibilities for illusion games involving space, light, colors and a few cats. The externally simple world of space is hampered by the unstable dimensions of a text that is constantly influenced by the filmmaker's interference, which appear on a computer monitor and serve as a counterpoint to the transformation-like environment. The constantly changing perspective makes it difficult to answer questions that arise: what is "truth" and what is "illusion"? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to others? Can anything serve as a landmark in the narrative space?
