Steven Spielberg (24) had already staged two great episodes from a 1971 series called The Psychiatrist starring Roy Thinnes. One episode was about an emotionally disturbed 12-year-old boy and the other was about a vivacious young man (Clu Gulager at his best) who dies of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually unlike anything else on television and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced his first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on first-class, experienced TV directors for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after seeing part of the Clu Gulagher episode of The Psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> Spielberg says on the DVD of "Duel" that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" script for a Levinson / Link story), and he tried to make the production like a million Dollar feature to look, although he thought he had much less money available. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far more visually stylish and uses the soundtrack and background music better than almost any other "Columbo" episode, even though the series has always worked with top directors. Spielberg manages to keep the big Falk and Cassidy from banging him too hard, but both actors are still having fun. Spielberg is also supported by Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have freshness and vitality. The only "Columbo" episode that was almost equally well-governed is the "By Dawn's Early Light" episode with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggests that Spielberg, as a director, has not developed that much technically, he was great from the beginning "Battle!" Robert Altman, DVD commentary on a 1962 guest starring Albert Salmi, says the episode was as good as he never did as a director, and perhaps the same applies to Spielberg.
