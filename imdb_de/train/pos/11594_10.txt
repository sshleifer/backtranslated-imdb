I just found the IMDb and searched this movie, and I was almost moved to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this movie when I was about 6 years old in 1967. I saw it in front of the jungle book, so I spent a few hours on Eagle Boy and then Mowgli for the next year. I broke out in the cinema when the boy became an eagle and wanted to watch the movie again and again. When we got home there was a roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said "I bet you wanted to be an eagle" and of course we all know that desires are broken when someone has guessed more tears and a little grudge because he can not fly away ...
