Another very good man movie thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedic conscience of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He's there to see the younger man take the fork or turn. "You are wrong, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only for himself, but it is clear that he can not abandon Brennan. John McIntire is honored as the law of Skagway, with due respect for justice in relation to reality. Another key issue is helping people and, in turn, helping people. The loner does not like both and suffers from it. <br /> <br /> The headline above plays on Tatum's claim that he can not live without coffee. This nicotine addiction turns out to be fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now own the DVD.
