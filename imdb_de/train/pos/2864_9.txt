It was a joke about bonanza, how fatal it was for women to engage with cartwright men. After all, Ben Cartwright was widowed with a son three times with every marriage. And any woman who dealt with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe would end up dying because we could not get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons who started this classic TV western. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writers, if Bonanza were performing today, would have had rotating female characters that came out of and came out of the life of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some are good, some are not so good, it's just life. And we are less demanding today by our heroes. So if a relationship with one of them goes south, we do not have to kill the character to keep the nobility of the survivors intact. But that would be if Bonanza finished today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while for the situation to become established and a change in the viewing time of NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his relentless sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV dad in every genre you want to call. All his life he spent with the hard work of building this huge Ponderosa for his three children. The children were all different in their personality, but all came together for need. The Cartwrights were and still are an American institution. I probably dare that more people cared about this family than the Kennedy. But the popularity that Bonanza has in the syndication testifies to this. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as eldest son Adam was written off the show. It is rumored that he was not interested in the noble Cartwright characters he seemed to be adjacent to the heir. If he had finished now, he would have preferred it the way I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, as many people get their money on three hit TV shows. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hearty, but the most romantic of the cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. The show continued with the two younger sons, but when the great Dan Blocker left, Bonanza's heart went out. At that time more characters were added, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright took over the young Mitch bird. But big, loyal, but a bit thick, Hoss was the darling of the cartwrights. His sudden death after surgery left too much of a hole in this family. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights of Ponderosa have gone down in history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It does not look like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, where you can see the Ponderosa on the map, is the Cartwright House, which remains as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the Ranchhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should have been.
