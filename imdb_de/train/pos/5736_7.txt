Dumland focuses on the life of a (American?) Family ... The Father; a violent and obscene person who loves to take fart and use obscenities and who has no redeeming qualities. The mother; Who seems to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much. The son; an obscure, annoying, repetitive little guy. The animation is simple and crude, but matches the stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available on the davidlynch.com website and have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a brief summary follows: <br /> <br /> 1- The Neighbor: We meet the neighbor next door and find out three things about him ... he has a really nice shed he has only one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> 2- The treadmill: We find that the woman has an affinity to the movement, but the husband does not really think that this is a woman's good idea. In the end, the treadmill is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3- The doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed power cord. The doctor's exam is pretty thorough (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is "you are completely normal" (but we knew that). <br /> <br /> 4- A friend visits: After a confrontation with the new clothes lift, a friend comes to visit (believe it or not, he has one!) but after meeting him, we can understand why ) no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5 Get the Stick: We meet another neighbor, he has a stick his mouth (although we never know how it got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from his neighbor's mouth is more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but in the end he is victorious ... Jesus, some people may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth bleed: This was my favorite episode ... and it was also the most annoyingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that say about me ??). I'm not sure why the son's teeth were bleeding, but believe me when I say that this was minimal for the story's plot. Which is an oxymoron, since the story had no action. But there was a funny ending (with a fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we have a distinct feeling that the Dumbland gene pool is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sickly guy (I will not do it so I can not ruin it for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants in his family ... and the dad definitely ends up on the wrong side of her copious fist (and spends the rest of her visit cowering in a tree in the backyard). 8- Ants: After the house has been infiltrated with ants and a misunderstood attempt to spray them, it goes awry ... He finally sprays his face with the bug spray and begins to hallucinate. The ants organize a fabulous singing and dancing show ... He makes an insane attempt to kill them, wraps himself in a full-body patch ... and can be said that the ants in the end get their revenge. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories are, there is something that forces me to watch them. They give another insight into the thoughts of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch Maybe they were an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? I actually laughed loudly in many places in the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny !!
