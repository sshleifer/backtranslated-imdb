I watched VH1 every night this week. This is a terrific insightful portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs were shown in the media in the late '60s and' 70s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, the Beatles, the death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has made a complex presentation of life and times during the "drug years". From Sanfrancisco Bay to Studio 54, this documentary shows the development and progress of the drug business, as well as the death and new life that has breathed American culture. From marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentary shows how drugs got into the country. The hippie movement, the conservative resistance and the impact of drugs on the arts (music, movies, etc.) with tons of intriguing interviews and news reel footage. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: The Trip Easy Rider In Smoke Reefer Insanity Bounce Boogie Nights
