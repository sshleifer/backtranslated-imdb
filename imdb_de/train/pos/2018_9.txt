I liked it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> It might have taken a little more screen time for the delicious Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was amazing from the start. <br /> <br /> The one who thrilled me the most with surprising shock, awe and wonder was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Forsyte Saga and everything else I've seen him in. But he surpasses himself as Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined him playing a crazy psycho like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does it. And I love it. And I love him.
