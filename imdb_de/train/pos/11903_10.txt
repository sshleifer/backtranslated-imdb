I was fortunate enough to see this film when I volunteered at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and most of all the gimmicks of William Castle, so this was definitely a must for me. <br /> <br /> This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director. Sure, he made some cheap, slippery horror movies, but he added something to those movies: real live theater gimmicks you can not see anymore. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in his films and put vibrators on the chair beds in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is really a well-done documentary, bringing this shaded director to light and celebrating his contributions to the horror cinema. It also draws Castle as a larger than life figure who was very popular and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most film documentaries, most of which show the wills of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews, mainly of family members and directors influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must for classic horror and science fiction fans.
