I rate this with 10 out of 10 points. Why? <br /> <br /> * It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because they want everything they want; Nothing seems as important to them as surfing. It's not a temporary thing either - it's a lifetime for these guys. Buried in the movie is a great story of surfing. I have never surfed, but I love to watch movies and have seen many. No one taught me what this movie did. * The film was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were excellent. * It is interesting from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's about as good as a documentary, as I've seen, so I have to rate that. So 10/10
