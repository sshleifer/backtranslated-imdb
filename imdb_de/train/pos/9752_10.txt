I remember well how I saw it when I was three years old. Then my parents inadvertently reworked everything but a few seconds with another cartoon. I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it. Since I could understand things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I rediscovered it thanks to some internet articles / video clips. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but for us 20-30, it's definitely "cult status." It is a shame that the original production went through a painful process; If Fox had enough time, it would probably be better known to the public today. Maybe, if they would occupy it with a completely different story and an all-star voice, it could be, but Fox decides. I'm walking here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than great.
