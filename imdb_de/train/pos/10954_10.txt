Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus, it's magic, you'll love that. If not, what's wrong with you? Kudos to the Comedy Channel for putting it in my face. My life finally has a meaning and "your car smells like fart" is my kind of humor. I am a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I'm looking forward to the next week. This is like Grease would hit South Park. Totally outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch while reading the phone book. Your delivery is accurate and oh so funny. She never skips a beat. Come to think about it, it's not so much the choice of materials. By the way, that's really good stuff, by the way it's the way it delivers it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedy Channel!
