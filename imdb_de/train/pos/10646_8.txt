This great movie consists mainly of documentary footage that is currently included with Prelude to War on a DVD. The great American filmmaker and storyteller Frank Capra made these films, which simply and clearly draw attention to the main points that caused the rise of World War II and Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every school kid, no, every American should see these movies today because they are so apropos. The story has been repeated over and over! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking. The tactics adopted by the Nazis by sympathizers and later by the communists and now also by Muslim terrorist groups into the countries of infiltration continue to benefit the evil group. They lean back and let Hitler be aggressive as early as 1935 - France, America and England cause more than 50 million deaths. Americans, French and British would happily do the same to Hitler today, even though we should have learned from history what happens when dictators break treaties. <br /> <br /> These great films may be too simplistic history buffs of the Second World War. They do not tell the horrors caused by the Soviet Union, simply because America worked with them and fought Hitler. This film tells the simple facts and motives that led to the terrible war.
