Full score for Pacino's rendering of the speech about the dead child's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed !! Was it Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper who should compliment the remarkable dialogues? You are rich and intelligent and worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I thought the narrative of the story was pretty well developed until the voice over postscript. <br /> <br /> There is not much to discuss in this film. Even John Cusack has done better than this. Interestingly, the film is very male-oriented - the women are just appendages.
