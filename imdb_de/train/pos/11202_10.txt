At first, I thought the ring would be more than normal with its usual plot. How surprised I was! Of course the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock puts it on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, compassion and torment. As he represents the masses of the mass, the strength of the girl's attraction for both men, the tragic elements combined with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (North by Northwest, the Rope, etc). Master made it great even before his thirties!
