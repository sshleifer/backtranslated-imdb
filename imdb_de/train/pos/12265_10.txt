"Tintin and I" first appeared to me as a documentary. The photography and the cut are really breathtaking (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> We trace the life of Tintin draftsman Hergé in an open interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn in the background of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these realms, Hergé has his own demons to battle with, and much of his drawing work seems to be an attempt to tame them and flee into a world of perfection, panoramas of drawings of Tintin albums, as well as some reconstructions and reading passages from the albums. The story of Hergé is told exclusively through interviews and archive material and never through reconstructions a true, suffering artist. But the fantastic world born of his imagination will astonish readers time and time again.
