Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that will grab you and not let you go until the end, especially when you see it as a kid. If you see the movie as an adult, you have to admit that it's not really scary, but the story is very intriguing and contains a lot of great mysterious scenes (especially those with the spooky mummy). <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is undoubtedly the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new camper. The scene with the rocks is very exciting and quite scary. Even the scenes in which the main character discovers his mother's secret are quite scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, the drama in the movie is not great and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but overall ghosts that are still going are fun. Too bad that only a few people have seen this movie, this movie deserves something better. I just want to say: Mr Flocker, you have done a good job! And for all Hollywood producers out there; If you want to recreate a movie, do it again!
