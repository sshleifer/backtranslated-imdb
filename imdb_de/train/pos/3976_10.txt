I have just watched The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the drug history very well and, above all, it has a strong message to all generations. There is Woodstock, there is the death of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the timeframe and evolution of drug use in both good and bad terms. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate the creators, because that is exactly what is on television today. I'm waiting for the DVD release. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is breathtaking - GREAT TIME!
