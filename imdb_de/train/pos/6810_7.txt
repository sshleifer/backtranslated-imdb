After reading the book, I stumbled upon this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and figured, what the hell ... I got the DVD and saw it last night. When I started to look at it, I checked the runtime and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, okay, cool ... It seemed to be running pretty slow and knew the story and how much of it was there. When I came to the actual murders, I thought, "How much time is left?" Checked "One minute ... what the hell ?!" I felt incredibly cheated when I thought the movie was only going through a third of the story. <br /> <br /> But then I noticed that the DVD's scene selection menu had a part 1 AND a part 2 left to go for an hour and a half! I then sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first one. <br /> <br /> I admit that I have not seen the original movie of 1967 (despite my sincere wish). However, read the novel and feel that this is a pretty rundown movie for a two-part TV mini-series. I think casting the role of Perry was totally wrong and a few minor inconsistencies sprang up, but still very well done. The first half pulls a little while, while the second half is much more exciting. I think they should have made the movie more like Capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the murderers were arrested. Instead, the film makes more 1/2 before the killings, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the killers were arrested. This also makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time less convincing, as the first half is pulled farther and farther ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I've just done the same mistake about that Things are going on and on, so I'm going to silence hell. Watch the movie and make your own mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
