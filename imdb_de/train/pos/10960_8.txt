I really do not remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It's certainly a strange thing - like a rebel in a car accident. Someone said truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can not understand how a fictional report on this documentary will be published this year. How can you improve that? The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy are leaving the New York Society and hiding in the Hamptons. They become hermits and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies". They would have remained hidden if the city had not moved to condemn the property for the dirt and subsequent rescue by Jackie. This movie was shot after this rescue. Meanwhile, you could not help but think, "How bad was it before?" It's a glimpse of the high society from the dark side and it's absolutely mesmerizing.
