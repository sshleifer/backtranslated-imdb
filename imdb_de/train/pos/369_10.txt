Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times and can not go through it without crying. I challenge everyone to see the reunion of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and Father, and do not feel your eyes foggy. Whoopie Goldberg should receive an award for an amazing presentation. And for the person who said you could not love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I am proof of that.
