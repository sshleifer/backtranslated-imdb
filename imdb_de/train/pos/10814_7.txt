Given the opposite of 2009, when we actually have a black president, this film has a very strong historical significance. For the entertainment value, I found that this movie is both engaging and repulsive. I was, of course, quite withdrawn from the racist racism of the time, but also found the music and dance incredible. It's also pretty cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young kid actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a little boy comforted by his Mammy. He is told why one day he could be president. This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and felt to be adorable, charming and witty. The main part of the film is a fantasy sequence of what the government would look like if it was led by a black man. They portray the seat of government as a revitalized Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was, one day, when I came across this movie he dragged me into. I think that if we can look beyond racism, we can see this film for everything it brings us. Realizing that it's not just ridiculous to have a black president, but that it's normal, just makes this movie much more relevant. It is clearly a time for our collective consciousness.
