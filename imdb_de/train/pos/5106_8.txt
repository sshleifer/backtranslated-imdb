I guess every time I see one of those old 80s movies, it makes me think of a simpler time, no matter how cheesy they may seem today. This movie is good. I remember that I saw it as a kid and thought it was the greatest movie of all time. It has all the heroic characters a young cowboy wants to be. As an adult, I can look back and laugh and am still sad, but this time I actually know what's going on. I found one thing funny. How many people can move to Houston and meet with Sissy, getting married, getting into a caravan, failing, cheating, dying an uncle, and then coming back together over the course of a month? Only in America.
