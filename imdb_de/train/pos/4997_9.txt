This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action movies. Apart from his small storyline, the weak drama and the comic antiques, the movie is action packed with gun violence and martial arts action. Had me talk from beginning to end. I thought that Shannon Lee was great in the movie. <br /> <br /> An action director like Corey Yuen is what makes the action in Hong Kong strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
