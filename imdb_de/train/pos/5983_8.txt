I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal dominated the world. Trick or Treat has every element for a movie that rocks. With a cast featuring Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can one go wrong? Backwards evil news played on vinyl! Yes that's right, they use records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) hears a message from the evil rock star on his turntable as it gets weird. Monsters come out of his speakers and his stereo gets obsessed. As a teenager, I tried to play my records backwards, hoping it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
