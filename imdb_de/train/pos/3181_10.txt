I had the opportunity to see this movie debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, where it received a Best Picture Award. This movie is brilliant, with a great cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite acts were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also some great effects on dragonflies and cockroaches, and I was surprised to learn that this movie was made on a small budget. Director Adam Jones, whom I believe received a prize for his writing, does an excellent job with the direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh throughout the movie. Definitely a must.
