I only saw this movie once, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago, and after looking at it, I think it's even better than I thought. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than a horror. It had such amazing levels of emotion and great characterization that it went through. I especially thought that Charlotte Burke was really outstanding here. It's so sad she did not do anything else, because she was an outstanding actress. Her portrayal of emotions throughout the movie was perfect with the right amount of subtlety to convey the message, especially at the end, when she realized that Marc, though he had died, knew he was well. <br /> <br /> Several scenes have made me jump (which is a rarity in modern horror films for me), especially the scene in the bathtub, the scene in which Anna's dad used her with the weird radio in the background and the piece in which the legs were located chased apart and crumbled to dust. <br /> <br /> All in all an excellent and very moving movie.
