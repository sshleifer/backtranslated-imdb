I saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) asked questions and answers. <br /> <br /> I could not believe that this is a first director and all the best for Harvey Keitel Once again he took the risk and set to work for a screenplay he liked. <br /> <br /> It certainly reminds of Cinema Paradiso and tells the story of the young director about the revolution in Cuba. But do not expect that this is a movie about the revolution. Your political attitude is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to directors' obvious love of film history (a great "Bicycle Thief" tribute) and some bizarre scenes that work without presumption. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
