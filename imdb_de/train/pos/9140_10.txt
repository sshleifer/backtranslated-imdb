I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has been my heart since I can remember. Prince is so close in this movie. I was at Purple Rain's special show last night and it was like a concert. I was happy to see some real fans because this movie is so undervalued that it is truly one of the best movies ever. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in the city, and he has Apollonia, an aspiring singer, in his sights. There is no question why Lila is my favorite color, for which I can thank "The Kid". So if you have not seen it, you need to do it as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
