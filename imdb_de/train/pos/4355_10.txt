I also saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent movie about family relationships between adults. Paul Reiser wrote the film and made some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, moving and entertaining. A movie like this would do very well with word of mouth ratings. I would definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's just hope they have the chance. I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I have seen in a year. It contains no violence, no action scenes, murders or sex. Therefore, the distributors obviously ask themselves if they should accept it or not. Believe me, there are people who would love to see a movie like this, which has a redeeming value, instead of the many typical big coffers we normally get.
