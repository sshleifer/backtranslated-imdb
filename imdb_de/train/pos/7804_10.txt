I watch this movie over and over. I have to see it at least once a week. I come from Africa and when I watch this movie I learned some things that I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films offer a wealth of lessons for people from different walks of life. I wish he was my own brother. I have also seen and loved your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to join his brother to work, he reminds me of my age, when my brother was always mad at me because I was constantly busy with it. My brother always looked after my old father and he wants to see me that way too. By the way, where did Denzel get this African accent in the Cry Freedom movie? I saw this movie for the first time in Africa and did not know then that Denzel was American until I moved here.
