I was not sure when I heard about it. I thought about how stupid Disney is. I was wrong. I thought it was very good. I mean, it's not the Lion King, but it's cool to see a different side from a certain point. It was very funny. It was not one of those crazy Disney sequels that the shit on animation was. The only thing that irritated me was the whole movie thing. To give nothing, but you know what I'm talking about. I also enjoy that it was cool to have the most cast back from the original. It was a very good movie about everything.
