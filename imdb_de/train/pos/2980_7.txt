This movie is just funny. thoughtless, but funny. To fully enjoy this movie, you can not imagine how a movie like this goes, just enjoy all the side jokes and puns associated with the movie. I still think the play is funny when it says "Do you want a beer ........ cock"? Funny stuff. But what makes the movie decent is the fact that it's not hard enough to turn the movie seriously, too many comedies are trying to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe in. But that's different and just focuses on being funny. However, I have to say Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and does not add anything, except the 3 main characters, Coop, Remer and Squeak are very funny to watch and make the movie great
