This is a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's a pretty short movie, and I definitely recommend it more than once, you'll get it the second time around. <br /> <br /> It's like a backbone, but the rap version. It has a lot of attitude that can be a negative thing in rap-influenced movies, but it's just a total P ** s attitude and not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> Many outstanding pieces, one of these film types, where you yourself will quote lines with your comrades, and that will cause laughter. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite part is the 'guerrillas in the middle'. Section. Great video, great!
