Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to get, the length is now standard and you have gone long without it. (There were at least three versions missing at the start of the home video.) Everything you read is true. There is no defense and no life without it. The color is lush and beautiful to look at, and the production values ​​are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kids pick. But no question ... the whole Santa The Satan Angle is so stunning that the movie became a hit and became a cult fan as soon as the home video really started. How good / bad / strange / is it? I only saw the TRAILER as a kid and remembered IT for almost 30 years. Including Murray's voice. I told my older sister that she called me a liar and could not believe that EVERYONE could make a movie in which Santa vs. Satan .. Add the stuff, like Santa Claus, who asks for the Blessing of the Blessed Virgin before you set off on Christmas Eve, children who want to capture him and make him their slave .. and an international kiddie sweat shop. It's probably close to many nightmares that kids had in their sixties. Like others here I watch the matter now every Christmas time. (My version of the choice is The Mystery Science Theater 3000). Whatever you choose for a movie, the film is a demented masterpiece and an absolute must (besides Brianiac, by the way ...) and always makes me laugh. Better, I think, then defeats SANTA CLAUS THE MARTIANS. Parts of it can still make you crawl or you just crawl out. (How many parents do you know that you go out to eat cocktails on Christmas Eve? "If you get bored, just go down and play the piano." DANG ..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, weird .. hey, what more could you want?
