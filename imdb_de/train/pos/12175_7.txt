What would you say about a man who was about to get married and had his bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar? Sail everything smoothly until he drops off his "bachelor hat". What would you say if he talks to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeps with her? What would you say if this girl was the cousin of his finances? A new low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, weirdly played by Jason Lee, executes this experience of a foul-smelling blur and a new low. I have to say that this is one of his good lead roles. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky was better played. <br /> <br /> His finances named Karen are played by up and down actress actress Selma Blair, while Karen's character Becky is played by the lovable and talented Julia Stiles. Back to the point where we left off, Paul now has to deal with an emerging problem. He gets sick, has to deal with certain people and has to play his games of lies stealthily, or any family member could get P. O'ed, including one of his relatives who did not have "bowel movements" for 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to the long awaited wedding with a hilarious scene, before all the hell Paul and his brother had to go through is repeated. All in all, A Guy Thing is pretty funny and is good too. Sometimes the story does not seem to go anywhere and you get fed up with scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie, and if you're a Canadian and a fan of the CTV board-butt sitcom Corner Gas, you'd see a small part who played Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the weird Hank of the series, this movie is alright, it's another feather in Lee's hat (though a pretty empty hat). <br /> <br /> My rating : 7/10 <br /> <br /> Elias on A.
