At that time, when musicals were not showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful films like this one. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was pleased to finally see this movie. Not exactly a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. A part of American variety humor, the slapstick not the funny banter, meets Wodehouse's British humor. On the whole, however, the American characters seem more like cardboard cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some imaginative dance-number productions, including the wonderful revolving floors and Funhouse mirrors, do more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They seem far more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. It's also nice not to have a smart, headstrong love interest. Instead, we have a gentle, stubborn love interest, much more in tune with the young aristocratic wives of women.
