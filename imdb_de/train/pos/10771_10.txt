There's a star star in this movie, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard, and Jim Belushi, to name just a few, who are amused in Monte Carlo and other beautiful European venues and are very funny. The effort that everyone gets when lying to protect themselves is great, and I strongly recommend that you watch this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in prime shape on Once Upon A Crime, just like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives outstanding performances, great plays, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in movies today. Great conspiracy, great mystery (which I really love anyway) and overall worth the money you spend on it. Get the kids, grab popcorn, juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show!
