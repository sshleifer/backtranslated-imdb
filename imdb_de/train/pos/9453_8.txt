Liberation is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing story of James Dickey, who became a brilliant film by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen driven by masculinity and macho behavior who spend a canoe weekend high in the mountains. Up there they are standing in front of every darkest side of mankind and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, mistakes and even physical harassment! These four men wanted to go down the river to experience adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turns into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain land completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I have ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these men, pray that you are never in a similar situation. The pure cinema, Deliverance is also a very important movie. John Boorman's best film (followed closely by Zardoz and Excalibur) was and still is a very influential film and contains several memorable scenes that have been featured in countless other films. Just think of the grandiose "Dueling Banjos" score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual rape scene. All actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. Especially Jon Voight. A must see movie !!
