This movie has great fight scenes. Now it is true that the drama is a bit rough. But if I wanted to watch a movie based on acting skills, I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts and amazing stunts, WITHOUT the use of wires and flies, the air like so many movies now flipping around kills the matrix. Then look at this. Now it's the two main stars on the show where the Power Ranger and another actor from the show play a role in the show. But the fight scenes are enough to let Jet Li do his pants. And the stunts are enough for Jackie Chan to sit and admire thrown.
