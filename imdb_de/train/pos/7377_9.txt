This film is practically impossible to describe. The alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. As in most Japanese cinemas, the story is not as linear as in America. The story revolves around a director shooting a story about a WW2 deserter. The set is chased by an actress who died while filming a television program in the 1960s. The director is the ONLY one to watch this show. If you have seen Ringu (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and you liked it, you will like Ghost actress. I loved Ghost actress much more than Ringu. a really scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
