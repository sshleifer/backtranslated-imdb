This is the only David Zucker movie that introduces nothing unusual. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at Roxbury right behind. But I did not find Theres anything funny about Mary. Do not listen to the critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know solid entertainment, just look at his ratings
