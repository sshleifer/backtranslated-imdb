This is apparently the second remake of this film, which was shot in 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it's reminiscent of the later film A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films are an imaginary blow-hard that arrives at one of the best schools in the world, and both show that the blow-hard has slowly learned from teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main opponent "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And in a supporting role is Jack Pickford - always remembered as a brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford, the most likable loser to become Tom's friend, is among the best - he actually has some decent scenes and a dramatic moment just before the big game! All popular clich√©s are there and the movie, because it has been made so many times before and since, offers few surprises. It is, however, a pleasant movie and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN for a better dumb college movie - his football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is much more personable and sympathetic than annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from this period. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikely and bombastic character with the same action (over and over again, as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET) - and if you have I have one Seen these films, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly NOT original! And because it's just a reissue of his other films, anyone who gives the film a rating of 10 is URGENT to watch those other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just looked and saw this little movie was the best rated movie on IMDb from the 1920s !! Talk about overvalued! There are dozens and dozens of better films - you could only guess how this movie became # 1.
