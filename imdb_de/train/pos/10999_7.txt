This movie is about this shaky guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. That shaky fellow Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is dissatisfied with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. It is believed that he visits conventions from other high-tech companies and finds out all the plans of the company. Instead, Morgan is attracted by a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and fairly crossed by these two companies, forcing him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get out of it? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan get it out alive? Impressive! What a nice movie! After 15 minutes watching this movie, I was completely sucked in. It's very exciting and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene in which they put this awful device on Morgan's head to brainwash him is incredibly scary and terrifying. Morgan slowly goes through a personality change, which is visible only after the end of the film. From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man who is actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> The end, wow, the end is incredible! The shoot is so much fun! It made me gasp and cheer like crazy! Good performances from all sides, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
