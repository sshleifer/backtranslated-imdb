Have seen this movie at its release and have appreciated it ever since. What a wonderful group of actors (I think casting is always one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). It was really fun seeing dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a shout. The script is smart, cunning and funny, it's almost everything "Beverley Hills". Loved Paul Bartel's "Doctor" and the servant of Ray Sharkey. That was slippery and rude, but thank goodness! If you are not proud, I recommend this movie from the heart. For your information, for anyone who likes to play six degrees by Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were at Rock & Roll High School. Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in the "Night of the Comet". They were all three in "Eating Raoul".
