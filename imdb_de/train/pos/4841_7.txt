In the colonies, we are not too familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which recently had a TCM preview) because it left negative comments on its appearance on "Ghost Train" - which I expected annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised that I laughed audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and timing in making a line suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparison with Bud Abbott or any of the other comic relief companies that appear in films of this genre. You can also feel the thread that connects Askey with the British comedy 30 years later. At least from the American point of view, it is clear that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with his colleagues here. As for the rest of the movie, the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess the end, but it's still entertaining and atmospheric, and it's worth waiting for the next gig.
