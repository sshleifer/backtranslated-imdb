As a person looking for a "professional" person whose income was supported by a BS in Chemistry and a MS in Business Management, my mental health has always been kept convulsively in outer indulgences in more artistic matters. My post-graduate courses have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art drawing, which also included screenprinting. I also stay healthy Jogging, hiking and more recently you're traveling to remote California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. When jogging, walking and hiking you get close to the earth, time to stop and watch and listen as well as to take pictures or record noises. <br /> <br /> In this background I was obsessed with rivers and floods. I was also impressed by the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy and the skills and suppleness of director / cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I could not really separate the art of Goldsworthy with the Riedelsheimer camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderfully wonderful
