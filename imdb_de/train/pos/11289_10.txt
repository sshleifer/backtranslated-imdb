There is something wonderful about the fact that a film from 1934 can be upside down over any Tarzan movie that followed, including the bloated and boring piece of Greystoke from the 1980s. Once the viewer is past the first three scenes, which are admittedly boring, Tarzan and his comrade lift off like a shot, offering action, humor and romance without interruption. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and starts the movie. Weism√ºller is also solid. Highly recommended.
