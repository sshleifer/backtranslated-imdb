"Capitães de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The fiction of the story is not particularly interesting, but it does not ruin the movie. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are no exaggerations and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia is still one of the greatest heroes of the April 25th revolution. All actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon still looks beautiful. Do not miss it! I really liked this movie.
