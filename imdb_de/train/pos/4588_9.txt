Rated with PG-13 for violence, short sex and humor. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a few times now. In my eyes, Police Story is the best movie by Chan from the 80s. Originally I did not see the protector, so I can not compare anything. The drama is not so bad and the plot is pretty good. I remember the plot well because I saw this movie a while ago, but I remember that this movie has a lot of great action, stunts and comedy, just what a good chan movie needs to buy this movie ! <br /> <br /> Running time: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
