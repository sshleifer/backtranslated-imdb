IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so realistic that sometimes it is more clinical than entertaining. Author Truman Capote devoted himself to the brutal murder of a Midwestern family and focused on minutiae. Brooks wildly deviates from this approach to be a little closer to Docudrama. Although he is filming on location, he keeps his distance. The killers are portrayed as spoiled idiots, which they certainly were. They are not considered misunderstood souls (as in the Capote book), and the cruelty of their deed is frighteningly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake excellently qualify as killers, as well as the minor cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a reporter (the Capote "character").
