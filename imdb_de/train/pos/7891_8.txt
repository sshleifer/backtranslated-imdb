Now all of Springwood, Ohio's kids and teens are all dead, which is still alive for a teenager (Shon Greenblatt). Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him go and the teenager has no big memories when he comes to a new city. When a strong psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break the new patient. She has figured out where he's from. She brings him to Springwood for some memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan) came unexpectedly for the ride. Once in Springwood, the psychologist has a memory that she has lived in this city as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rachel Talalay ("Ghost in the Machine", Tank Girl), she has made a grim, but oddly different successor, with some visual style and funny moments for this horror / fantasy / Thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) plays a supporting role as a trauma expert for psychologists. This has some subtle visual effects (not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3D) and a good style for storytelling. He has brutally released some of the film series at the box office. DVD has a strong anamorphic widescreen transfer (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan) and a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD has the original movie trailer, a nightmare opinion and cast & crew information. The "Elm Street" Series Box Set, the eighth disc, has interviews with the cast and crew of this sixth film. The sixth movie is also in 3D for the movie highlight, but you can also see it in 2D. This is the last of the "Elm Street" movies, until Wes revived Craven Freddy in "New Nightmare" and the stupid, surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror movie "Freddy Vs Jason." Look for Robert Shaye (co-owner and co-CEO of New Line Cinema), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness). From a story of the director. (*** Â½ / *****).
