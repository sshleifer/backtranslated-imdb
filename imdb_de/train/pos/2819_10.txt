This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The "Dragon Lord" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy "Cowboy" made the movie totally funny, meaningful and just stupid. The movie is a rare mix of a good vs. evil fight and (somehow) the wonders and the fun that grows up. Long Shao Ye guides the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy." This includes the implementation of clever and costly methods for learning (with the help of the entire household, including the caregiver), who competes in a rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) way to gain the affection of a local girl in football "(You'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they are in the middle of a fight to save a load of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The movie has its serious moments. But they do not depress, but inspire. The playfulness of the boys is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against the evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which was great in itself), but you will see it. Let me just say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> dumb, funny, meaningful and nostalgic. Great movie.
