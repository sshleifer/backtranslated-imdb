This is an excellent movie. It's about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the effort of a man and the relationship between this man (the main detective) and his superior. Thing That's the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) for the most part (please excuse the bad spelling!). For some reason, it moves to see how their development of hostility and insult turns into respect and camaraderie. One line in the film sums it up for me: "He would say something funny, but he's overwhelmed with emotion." <br /> <br /> This is not a frenzied action thriller. In fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes. <br /> <br />
