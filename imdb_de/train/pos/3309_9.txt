This is a great movie. If this is an indication, then Hong Sang-Soo is truly "the best kept secret of Asian cinema". It is very similar to the Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien styles and thematically covers the same thematic aspects as they do, but I think I appreciate this more than any of their films overall. The obvious minimalism here is a little less pronounced than in his work, though he still fits in perfectly with the style (the camera never moves once), and somehow I found the film less self-assured than "slow" than Tsai Ming-liang or Hou Hsiao -hsien, which in my opinion is part of the reason why I enjoyed it more. Besides, it does not keep subjects like Hou. I felt that the film was also somehow "more complete" and less open (just barely) than some of her work, though that's not to say that there was much of something reminiscent of a forward-looking conspiracy. I find it hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman wandering alone and languishing in her hotel room with punk panties can not seem otherwise than familiar).
