I knew that I would see that when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was a reason, but the theme of holding on to your dreams appeals to me. People talk about a movie for kids, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers who are aging, with weak parents, our own mortality, our children who are growing up and relying on us, and all the other things which we never thought would come to terms with us <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of a tragedy; It's about what it means to live dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but he makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths turns a small part of the woman into a thoughtful, multi-layered performance. The camera work is slow and sweet. When they put together this movie, they left everything that was not necessary. Very nice.
