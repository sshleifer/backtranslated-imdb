I loved this show when I was a kid and I still watch the first season DVD at 19 today. What can I say? I grew up in a house, much like Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. I also grew up in the house with my mother. I do not know what I would have done on television without Full House. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to any of them because I'm the middle kid of my family like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like that the show always has moral values ​​because I really do not like any of the OC-like shows today. I also like the comedy of Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are the uncles of the girls, the father's friend and the father respectively. The story goes that after the girl's mother dies, Danny's best friend Joey and brother-in-law Jesse moved in to raise the children. Three men who want to raise three young girls = weird. Every character in Full House is full of heart, fun and truly believable. Joey is an aspiring comedian with heart and soul of a child. Jesse is the cool motorcyclist, a tough guy who gets softened by his three nieces and later by his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
