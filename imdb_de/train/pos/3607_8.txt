So a few years ago I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night and thought I would spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War". With such a title, I had thought that it was an exploitation "B" about inner-city gangs. <br /> <br /> Much to my surprise, it was not about it. Instead, it's a well-rehearsed, well-written story about a young woman who accidentally falls into female boxing. She is responsible for bringing her younger brother to his practice sessions and getting interested while watching his struggles. Since he does not really want to be a boxer (only following the desires of his father), she persuades his trainer to take her in his place. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as she goes through various trials in her quest. For starters, her brother's coach does not want to take on a boxer. After reluctantly doing so, she has the problem of hitting matches. Then the confrontation with her father, when he finds out what's going on. Yes, a love interest develops, but it serves to improve the plot, and encounters an interesting inter-human reaction with its own combat-related consequences few seem to have heard of it. Some time later, when I saw the much advertised and well-respected "Million Dollar Baby," I thought, "Wait a minute, that seems somehow familiar." Needless to say, I did not see "Hart's War" that night.
