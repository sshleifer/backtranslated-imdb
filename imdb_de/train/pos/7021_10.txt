I had the pleasure of seeing a screening of The Pacific and Eddy at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this past weekend. This movie caught my attention some time ago when I stumbled across an article in Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting then, but nothing too exciting. Anyway, I saw it on the festival program and decided to give it a try. All I can say is that I was speechless when the credits started. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I have seen for some time. Photography, art direction, acting and above all directing were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is "spelled out" for you in this film and will actually make you think. Something that a large majority of films do the opposite these days. The dialogue is elaborate, and although this script does not chatter from wall to wall, the words of the characters are very deliberate and meaningful the more things you notice. It is a very complex and intelligent movie. Not sure when or where it plays again, but an absolute must for movie lovers.
