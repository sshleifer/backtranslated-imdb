Yes, this movie is predictable and definitely not a price material. But then it does not try to be something that it is not. A funny move with really funny one-lines, an outstanding and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole, an earthy and down to earth performance by Joan Plowright. The performance of the band was in place, and each played their role in a clever, funny way. The music was good, but not great, but filled the movie well. From some negative remarks, I concluded that the subtlety of some humor went over her head. A good example is the commentary on the "weird baseball-like game", well, my dear American, that was cricket - from which baseball is derived - and the explanation of the ignorance of the US band was for those who know cricket, very funny . Also no, you should not flinch when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for break and the manager said "oh no" also in terms of money. It seems like every joke has to be explained to some people ... All in all it was fun and I had some great laughs! Worth seeing.
