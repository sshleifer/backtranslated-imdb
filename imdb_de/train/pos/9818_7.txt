Robert Culp (they call his character "doctor" ... I think he's a vet or something) and the family moves to a wealthy suburb with low tax exemption. Lantern-cheek Culp and his dog are nearly killed when a few idiotic neighbors get drunk and drive through his front yard at 60 miles per hour. He pushes charges that provoke the children's anger and suddenly he and his family are victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign. <br /> <br /> - Woman admonishing him not to use violence against his sneering Nemeses, and who really only wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But the system will not get Culp anywhere and he will not leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock'n'roll music. And we all know what movie people do when the system fails ... (but this is based on a true story that makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is the case with the malicious hooligans. We have practical '70s funk-o-matic "teenage" music that warns us when they do not bode well. This film actually treats the age groups equally (really!). It does not make big generations of it. Kudos for that. <br /> <br /> Anyhow, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice and you like fire and you like justice for dogs they fire and you think people who run nervously out of troubled communities, are "too damn soft," then the ethos of this strip lies in their alley. No, it's not really "good", at least not in a widely accepted sense of the word. There is nothing subtle, undefined or clever, it is just a kind of PSA for alertness. It does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other popular works. Remember Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns as Batman leads the mutants on horseback to regain Gotham City? Remember the scene in A Christmas Story where the kid beats the face of the bat? Do you remember how cool that was? Or do you really hate to be considered funny by your neighbors? Yes, mon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was a television-formed movie in 1973 that I had just recorded at 4pm in the morning with my local WB partner, and probably not intended for DVD release. But after being inspired by this movie, do you think I'm just sitting here and taking it!?!
