It's hard to rate movies like this because you think it's production or just fun. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89 or something when I was a boy, and I'm sorry Let's say it started a lifelong fascination with ninja. The plot is pretty bleak and the drama is of course terrible, but there is some mystique about the ninjas in this movie that creates a good atmosphere. What's important are the fight scenes, while a 'little' is sparse really good. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it was better when I was a boy. Only now can I see the glaring dots of incredible nonsense in the movie, but as a "sit back with a few beers" martial arts films I can not fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of "American Ninja" style in In the 80s, hundreds of guys got kicked up in black suits, but really not very good fight scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting news story, Dusty Nelson, the author and director of Sakura Killers, shot another ninja movie under the Bonaire film flag called "White Phantom." I have no idea if this should be a sequel to Sakura Killers, "but the Sakura clan is another key feature, including the same logo and a similar story, this time with only a white ninja, even though they are mostly bleak I had a little sense of atmosphere, but the fight scenes are even scarcer and to be honest are pretty awful. <br /> <br /> So if you're a martial arts fan, then take the trouble to spend a few hours to kill!
