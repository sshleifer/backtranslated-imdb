I saw this movie in Tulane for the first time in my play & playwright class. I was impressed by how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look into the unlimited reality of a life of loneliness. The family is intriguing and I thought she really showed Little Edie at her core. As a side note, my professor even told me that Little Edie was spellbound while filming one of the cameramen. In the relationship between mother and daughter, it is obvious that none of them alone could function in society, and you begin to be interested in Little Edie's rehabilitation for society. Overall, the film is fascinating for its aesthetic quality and its surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
