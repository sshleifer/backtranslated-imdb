I consider myself a big movie fan. I was sick on the couch and popped in this movie. From the opening to the end, I have been awestruck by these great actors whom I have never met and said great words. The shoot was beautiful. It was exactly what I needed. I hope this news will be heard about bad comments from others. The director has a heart and it beats everywhere with his actors. Thanks for a movie like this. Just wonderful awkward, beautiful, friendly characters that are suddenly flawed and graceful. Just great. I can not submit this without a total of 10 lines, so I'll just say that I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this movie and more from the author. I did not want it to end. The end
