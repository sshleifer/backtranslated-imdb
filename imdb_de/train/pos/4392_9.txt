I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire does a great job as Jake. He has to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines throughout the movie. He was extremely good on that as well, although I've never seen him make a comic book before. The movie lets you be involved in the characters and really lets you know what's coming out of it. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did pretty well. Many exciting scenes. A thoroughly good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire. Read the Cider House Rules. One of the best times ever.
