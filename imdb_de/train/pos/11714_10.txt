Then you have to watch this movie to understand the reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke is now an advocate of bipolar disorder; formerly referred to as manic depression. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that people today still criticize other people with emotional problems or seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists and that is regrettable. <br /> <br /> In this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering that Ms. Duke had gone through especially as a child. Many of us may remember her from the teen "Patty Duke Show." At the age of fifteen, she was a household name in America. They learn of their exploitation by the Ross' (well played by Howard Hesseman). When she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full swing. However, we can see her progressing in her career, but the illness is getting worse and worse. She goes through drug abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone she divorces next week; and she has multiple conflicts and tantrums with her children and her older mother. All of these problems occurred before receiving adequate treatment and medication. A recent survey published by NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness) found that a majority of US adults do not recognize most classic symptoms of the disease bipolar disorder. It was also released that one in five respondents to the survey believed that people could fight their disease without medication if they so wished. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) When you watch this movie, you'll learn the true story of a talented woman who can not "pull up on bootstraps" and "get well" until she's been cleared up about her disorder and tidily received treatment , Thank you, Mrs Duke, for opposing ignorance and prejudice.
