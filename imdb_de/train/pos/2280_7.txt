Hard to categorize - maybe an avant-garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and certainly one of his simplest novels to turn into a feature film. The film is very original. The "indie approach" of how this film was produced is probably more effective than if it were funded by a major Hollywood studio. I doubt that an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood mealhouses. And usually that's too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a close sense and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to get better roles as he grows older, still has this "Everyman" persona who allows him to take on a variety of different characters. Sheryl Lee is as always beautiful and great. I always thought she deserved better when she came out of the entertainment industry. I think your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with low airtime is not the first choice, even if the TV show becomes an insignificant phenomenon. Still, this movie is absolutely enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. Considering today's geopolitical realities, the premise of the novel may seem outdated, and some younger onlookers with little knowledge of history are completely confused by the evolving events (I speak with you, Americans who are students and the least industrialized in the US Geography, history and Lord knows what other topics!).
