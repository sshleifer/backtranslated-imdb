This movie was like any other Jimmy Stewart movie, funny, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who yearns for people, is great. Her subtle facial expressions, every movement and gesture make Gillian unique and something she was a haunting character, letting us hang on to every word. I should absolutely mention the extremely commendable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester calling the Scottish writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the lovable aunt as a lovable aunt who can do that. It seems like the use of magic does not stop, even if it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautiful and the chemistry between them is great, but then the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and one of the leading actresses is bad!
