Since I remember, I loved airplanes and flies. I am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking for a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old tail spin ribbons at home in my basement and it hit me, that was it. My parents bought every single band they had, and this was the only show I would see as a kid. I memorized the topic when I grew up, and I can repeat it today. It's absolutely fantastic and I plan to buy the DVDs soon! It is really great for kids and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
