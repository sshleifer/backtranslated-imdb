This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still keeps up with me since I'm older. I still laugh about the same old jokes and sometimes even shed a tear. I've never looked after animals that talk, or at least UN-animated, but I'll stand up for it. It's a pretty old movie, but it will always have a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other live animal films that I can think of right now that I could even compare to, let alone as much as this one. I may be able to give this movie too much praise, but I do not think I show it. I really have the great message that home is the heart. Or at least that's the message I got out of it. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
