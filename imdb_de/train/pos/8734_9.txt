The movie was totally fantastic and cool. The graphics were outstanding and it was fantastic. Especially Flik was great and fantastic in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was smart. The circus bugs are colorful and they are great in the movie. The grasshoppers were also great and cool in the movie. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Dot was even cute. If the bird eats the beetles, this scene was great and good. The last scene was great and cool too. Flik's inventions were even good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers. If the ants are building the artificial bird, this scene was alright and I should really appreciate the creators of A Bug's Life.
