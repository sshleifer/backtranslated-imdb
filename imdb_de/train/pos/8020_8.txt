I thought this was the most beautiful Muppets movie because I felt it was light-hearted and delivered the best comic in most lines. The Muppets are trying to sell an original musical that they have written on Broadway. On the way there, however, they encounter the usual problems, including the memory loss of Kermit. There are not so many great cameos here as in the original "Muppets Movie", but also Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. The timing and delivery of so many lines is just great, and the situations in which the Muppets are located are hilarious. The original songs are also good here and the end is satisfactory. There is not much else to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should definitely see it. It's the funniest Muppet movie and will surely be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
