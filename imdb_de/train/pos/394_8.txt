This is an incredible comeback of Tsui Hark, the director of the film director. It is one of the few films that deserves to meet Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer face to face. From the moment the movie began, there were astral backdrops at each edge, which were exhausted with an outstanding style. If you're a science fiction fan or a Chinese martial artist, you'll love the excessive amounts of 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. Here comes (as always) a good performance from Ekin Cheung, who plays "Sky King". He collaborates with Louis Koo (Red), who impressed me greatly with his flexible "wing", which deflected incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were competent in every way. The action is not only outstanding, but also has a somewhat complex plot. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of story / theme or simply "in random fragments" and even referred to as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are famarialy with "Wu Xia" movies will have a better approach. In due respect It may be a foreseeable weakness. The blow inflicted on the enemy in the very last combat scene could be made more substantial and devastating. Despite all this it is a must.
