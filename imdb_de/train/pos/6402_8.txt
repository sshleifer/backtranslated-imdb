I found this move very good. There were a few things that were not perfect, but on the whole I was pretty surprised. The court scene seemed somewhat unrealistic in the end, but it was genuine enough to be entertaining. I found out that the film was the hardships of military education and its victims. As a military pilot, I could relate to many of these parts.
