Hickory Dickory Dock was a good mystery of Poirot. I admit I did not read the book, even though I'm an avid Agatha Christie fan. Adaptation is not without its problems, there were times when the humor and courageous attempts to get it right were a little exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution were rather rushed. I also thought that there were some slow moments, so that part of the mystery felt padded. However, I loved the way Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murder and it really set the atmosphere, which is related to the dark camera work and dark lighting. The dark moments were a bit scary, helped by one of the most intense scores in a Poirot version, perhaps not as disturbing as the One Two Buckle My Shoe that gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essentials, though not as intricate as Buckle My Shoe, and in a sense, that's a good thing. Acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use that word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) than Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and were overall well developed, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all a solid mystery, but it is not among the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
