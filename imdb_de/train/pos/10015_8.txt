Popular radio narrator Gabriel Keiner (Robin Williams, harshly speaking in subdued, hypnotic tones) meets a fourteen-year-old Wisconsin boy named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book on sexual abuse his parents. In addition, Pete has Aids and that forces Gabriel even further because his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, well) is an HIV survivor himself. <br /> <br /> He's also familiar with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, awesome!). When Gabriel decides, he wants to meet in person and talk to the two and goes to Wisconsin to discover some secrets he (of course) did not want to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real-life events that happened to Armistead Maupin (who wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer) ), as one might think, a movie of this genre would run. That's good, because the action and the plot stay slim and clear. It is bad in that it leaves several holes in the plot and does not sew up any of the storylines or the back story. I would rather not go into detail except to say that if you are not familiar with Mr. Maupin's works or personal story, you feel a bit out of the loop here. Still, the appearances of Williams (I would have loved to hear more of his narration in person), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and many of my fellow mates (the waitress at the restaurant Collete's Donna often does a good job with the small part she has!) Are top notch and the The mood set here - namely the cool, lonesome dark outskirts of Wisconsin and New York - gives this story a grandiose atmosphere. It may have ends that are not very well connected, but it's still a compelling story to stay with.
