Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy science fiction television series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. How much you try to apologize or explain, Stargate SG-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi TV series. Stargate SG-1 lends and steals ideas quickly. Special effects are not nearly as impressive as they could have been, and the action will not blow you out of the chair. Or for this matter, a sofa. <br /> <br /> But here I really believe that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the recognition it can get for every single episode or stolen idea that I believe you can count on. At least a cheesy science Fiction movie worse than a one-hour TV episode. In fact, some episodes could actually have been 90 minutes long and still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And to be able to maintain this quality throughout the show and to further develop and advance the storyline makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I'm very picky about my selection. I may be watching one or two TV series at most and have pretty high standards, which made me even more surprised when I felt caught. <br /> <br /> So for those who still opt for the Stargate SG-1 another sticky sci-fi show, not. Stay with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
