The second title of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; a title that adequately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie and could have been a classic movie when released during the silent film era. This film is a visual treat and is deliberately timed so that the viewer can enjoy its sensual lyrical quality presented in an artistic way. The style of the director is clearly European. The theme and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was produced in Hollywood back then. Look at the censorship code in the US in the 1930s, which pretty much sums it up. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love'.
