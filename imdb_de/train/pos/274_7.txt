I look at most of the films in which Nick Mancuso is because I honestly love the guy, though he's usually cast as a villain with age (longtime fans should be aware that he's blond in this movie for some reason). It's a pretty well-known film about action (but most films are not original anymore), but Rick Roberts likes being an imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is just as attractive as the daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a good job. If that was their goal, to be angry and sometimes quite difficult to like. Nick still knows how to show both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place off-screen - like motivation, past behaviors, good times, and bad times - and things that seem obvious to the characters never quite suit the audience (ie H. Mir). The last scene leaves much to be desired in the category "But what is ...", and overall I can not say that the characters were very important to me. Anyway, that was what it was-a pretty fun way to spend the afternoon-and I still like Nick.
