A few popular high school students play a cruel joke with the nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) who horribly disfigured him. Five years later, the gang returns for a reunion in the now fallen and abandoned high school. Of course, an angry and vengeful Marty appears in the costume of a fool to avenge his tormentors cruelly. The writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale have all performed exhausting shaky clich√©s that make these 80's Slice'n'Dice body count flicks so cheesy hard rock soundtrack, a pretty splash of female nudity, a totally ridiculous "What the hell! Devil?" supernatural climax, sticky make-up f / x and one of those lovable liars "it was all just a dreadful dream", fake-out-not-endings. In addition, the complicated murder sets deliver the cruel goods: Gorys highlights are the explosion of a man's stomach after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a guy crushed under a huge tractor, and two people, who get electrocuted in the middle to have wildly passionate sex. The 30-year-old British cult horror siren Caroline Munro has been misunderstood as an American teenager in the first third of the strip. All performers give solid performances, with particularly outstanding works by Carmine Iannaccone as smartaleck leader Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as faded macho-Meadead Frank and Donna Yeager as disgusting bitch Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a funny cameo appearance as Munro's slippery agent Manny. Harry Manfredini's melancholy, rattling music shamelessly recycles clues from his "Friday the 13th" scores. Alan Pudney's glittering cinematography does the trick. Good, shabby fun.
