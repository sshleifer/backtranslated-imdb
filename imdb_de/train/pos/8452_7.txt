Overused mobile suits that can destroy entire armies - Check! Weapons that barely have to aim and still destroy everything - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye candy. <br /> <br /> With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (though still has nothing to do with Heero Yuy, the main character in the series). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcher, is becoming more and more human and yet remains in character. And if you see the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whose witness is Marquise nomm de guerre) floating between OZ and the command of White Fang, shows how some people really lose themselves in their own creations. The complexity of The political and military situation is also quite good - it reflects the functioning of the real world. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it's a bit tricky that this complexity is not fully exploited. <br /> <br /> The ideas at the heart of the show - the need for fighting, the desire for peace, etc. - are still so today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, with the "War on Terrorism" and everything else. But exploring these ideas, the monologues, especially Treize Kushrenada's, is an incredible dramatic piece that makes up some of the best writings in the series. But sometimes, good writing is sometimes very bad, which dramatically leads to losing some of its edge. <br /> <br /> In terms of eye candy, as in buckets, everything ranges from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No, not the idiot tampons!) is well designed and exploding into big orange balls (which is bad because better animations would have had better explosions). But who cares ?! Stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you've missed a lot. The bad writing can make you falter, and sometimes the animation causes you to say "WTF?!?!" However, this is made up for by the classic animation style, the scaling, the spark of incredible dialogue, and the more mature exploration expected of such Japanese animations.
