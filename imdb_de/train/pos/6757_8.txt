Dana Andrews is featured in this 1950 film "Where the Sidewalk End," which features Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden, and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a bad-tempered policeman who has been in trouble in the past for beating suspects. When a man is murdered in a gambling club owned by a gangster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scalise blames the murder on Ken Paine (Stevens), who left the club after fighting not only with his wife Morgan (Tierney) but also with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim has won a lot of money and was killed by the Mobster men. He goes to Paine and does not realize that he has a plate of war from the war, knocking him down and killing him unintentionally. Now he has to cover up the murder. As a further complication he falls on Morgan; Her father (Ken Tully), who went to Pinee's apartment after seeing that Paine had beaten his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a really terrific, pithy Noir with some good performances. Robust and weather-beaten Andrews convinces as a tough but nervous detective who must always be one step ahead of his colleagues. The film unites him with his fabulous "Laura" costume, Gene Tierney, and she looks pretty like a man with a bad taste in a man who seems to be used to being roughened. Little does she know, she still has one in her hand. Ken Tully does a great job as her father, who despite innumerable evidence, combats his innocence. Karl Malden is very tough as boss of Dixon. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and absorbing film is the end. Pure Hollywood and, when I sit down at Tierney's place, I doubt I would react the same way. A minor criticism of a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as impressive as "Laura", but there are few things in this world. If you like Film Noir, this is a must.
