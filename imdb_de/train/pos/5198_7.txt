What can you say about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of Z-level blaxploitation films, and here he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This movie is a funky roller coaster ride with politically incorrect humor, trippy kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things that you would not find in most modern movies (or movies) Haha!). The stand-up routine he gives early must not be missed! In any case, D2 is definitely a fun way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and has no class! I'll rock that shotgun on his * beep * a **!"
