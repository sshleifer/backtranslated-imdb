I did not want to see that because I and my wife had little else to do on a Sunday afternoon. I like movies dealing with filthy loser characters and this is full of em. After a slow start we get some good spins from the cast, but it's the actual 'Bellini' that makes and makes the movie as well. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time, but it's too short and would have made it a masterpiece of 71/2 out of 10
