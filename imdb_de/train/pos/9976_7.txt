Sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and sometimes cheesy, but the filmmakers at least did not try. While most TV movies border on the edge of mediocrity, this film does indeed have some redeeming qualities. Cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows Aragorn in a movie about a man who plays by his own rules. Most flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of upset about Jason Priestly's role in the movie as a rebellious shock-jock, but it's also a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was horrible. However, it was nice to see that Tucson, Arizona, is prominently featured in the film.
