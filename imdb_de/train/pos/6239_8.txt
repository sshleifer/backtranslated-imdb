A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they do and maybe more, what they do not do. The pace is very calm ...... so you need to relax ... inhale ... exhale before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> First you think .... but nothing happens and you get a bit angry about it ... and that's the problem, because it's the mood of the movie and the really nice social realistic pictures that are beautiful in this movie ...... ..... many people will say it's disgusting ...... but it's not that bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are some really funny moments ... a 60 old woman stripping ..... I guarantee that it is the unsexyste striptease in the film history ...... his film, which is real ... I think that's the word ... ... right in her face ... .... and that makes it a bit scary. There is no computer manipulation ..... its real life ... and as we all know, movies can convince the reality for sick things ...... .... so it is much worse in the real world. ...... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie, you can start to look at your neighbors and think ... maybe they are like the people in a movie ... I bet it there are many of them out there ... sick ... crazy people living with a beautiful facade ........ after watching the movie, i feel that it looks more interesting to my neighbors ... ..... <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie on your first date .........
