Similar to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense and others. This film approaches the psyche in an unprecedented way. The first 30 minutes form an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is confusing, you'll pick more each time you look at it (I've been to the movies three times now)
