I read holes in 5th grade. When I heard that they were making a movie, I was thrilled. Of course, I had no opportunity to see the movie in the cinemas. Holes were outside the city at the drive-in, but unfortunately we were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and none of them had invited me! They all said it was good, but I read great books that made crappy films, and I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> It was this week and my parents went on a cruise and I had to take care of myself. My sister, who is 9 years old, and I have seen it and totally loved it! I then brought it to the other people I was a babysitter and their kids, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they are definitely movie critics. Overall, I recommend this movie for anyone who understands family morality and loves a funny cast! This movie should be on your Top 5 list "Seeing" !!!!
