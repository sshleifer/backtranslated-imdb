Each scene was put together perfectly. This movie had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. that's never been there before? He has the ability to beautify any movie with his amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I've seen this movie in "Blockbuster" sitting alone on a movie shelf, and as it demanded, I could not resist picking it up and bringing it home. You can call me juicy romantic, but this movie only touched my heart, not to mention that I laughed with pleasure at the same time. Even though it made me cry, I admit, in the end, the whole movie just lit up my view of life afterwards. I suggested to my horror, my action and my pure humor movie friend a brother who absolutely loved this movie. This is a movie with a good feeling of feeling. He could make you laugh, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy your life. Each time you intentionally miss this movie, be aware that you are aware of making the decision to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? What if it really happened to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
