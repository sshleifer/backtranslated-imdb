BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find" - although I've been a rock fan for almost thirty years, I only saw the movie a few days ago and counted it as one of the best rock movies of all time. The music is great (the cream of T. Rex) and the images are always exciting and unusual, so this viewer craves for former directorial work by Ringo Starr, who has done a good job here. If you love the music, you're in T. Rextasy through and through, because Marc Bolan is really the star of the play, front and center. Also, the fact that some songs are repeated is not insignificant: different locations, costumes, musical arrangements, and bizarre visual concepts are used to give different textures and humor to what could only end up 'a concert film in other hands. As rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE is, the movie is only about an hour long, but what is there is absolutely satisfying. Therein lies my only criticism: the video package says about 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims that the movie is 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rock fun.
