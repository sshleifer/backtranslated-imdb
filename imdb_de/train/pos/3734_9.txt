The dehumanizing effect of the war is a much-researched topic in the films. as well as the dehumanizing but potentially lifesaving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's "Tigerland" follows the standard template, we see men who are treated like dirt, but emerge as soldiers, with some mutual respect for their commanders, and it remains to be judged whether such an extreme process can be considered justified. as well as the verdict on the merits of the war for which they are trained (typically like here in Vietnam). "Tigerland," however, has an interesting take on concentrating on a cocky dissident named Bozz (well played by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power is ultimately governed by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless ones of their own Complicity. A learned, gripping plot has been constructed around this character, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket," to name but another movie of a similar type, once lost the action relocated to Asia). While this is not a film of amazing originality, it is thoroughly impressive to look at: the best movie this director has ever seen, and the best in his genre.
