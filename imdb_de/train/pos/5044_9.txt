Bill Paxton plays in this very original film and directs. I saw how good it was the first time. The reviews I heard were ok. As a result, I expected at most an average thriller. Still, the film is well worth seeing because of its excellent direction and acting, especially if you're a horror movie fanatic. The strongest point of the film is the story I have to say is very original and is as I have seen before. Well done with the 2 young leads that convey the emotions perfectly when these boys are confused. I give this movie 9/10 and recommend everyone to catch it.
