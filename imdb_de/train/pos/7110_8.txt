John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal, and who has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypes of blindness and is sure that he will be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his wounded Marines can not reach him. His girl can not be played by Eleanor Parker either. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudice. It's a complex role that makes Garfield memorable in a great performance, despite the omnipresent, syrupy melodrama. The best scenes are on Guadalcanal, where he's in a machine gun nest, trying to fend off the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish-looking night fight, and later on a dream sequence in the hospital, where he walks down a white platform, sees cane, dark glasses, and a tin cup while his girlfriend leaves the camera.
