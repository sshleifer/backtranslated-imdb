I recently looked at it on the Sundance channel. The idea for the film was to make short films for many filmmakers famous in their own country, eleven of them in a single-focus film: September 11. In this film, I was able to say why these filmmakers were so good in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. The film begins with a film from Iran in which a teacher is fighting to teach the students what happened to 9/11, which they later realized. <br /> <br /> The second film from France is a deaf woman who furiously writes a letter to her lover while she does not know what's going on as a TV. <br /> <br /> In the next film from Egypt, the filmmaker himself talks to a dead soldier about recent events, not only about September 11 terrorists but also bombings elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The next comes from Bolivia, where a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they have to march for her. <br /> <br / The next from a country in Africa, where a group of boys follows a man whom they believe is Bin Ladin. The next one is from Mexico, where nothing is shown apart from the sounds of this day. <br /> <br /> However, the next from Israel, involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb attempting to get a report, is frequently informed about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other films that I can. 'I can not remember at the moment, but they are all powerful. It will bring your emotions back from this day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
