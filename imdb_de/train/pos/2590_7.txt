The people who make this film bad are those who initially do not understand the movie. These are the people who love movie blockbusters and are opposed to any film that is not Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a nice little movie that may look strange and maybe even stupid at first glance, but what he lacks in the plot more than makes up for it. <br /> <br /> One thing in particular about the movie I was impressed by the use of music that plays a big role. These film music students will see how important music is in the film, both in Vida and Wilder's life and in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme, and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics play out. In the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl," Vida is at Wilder when the men sing something like "She's my girl," and then she goes to Wallace to give him something when the men do that sing lyrics "She will be my girl", which cleverly shows the tension between the two brothers. There are all sorts of subtleties in the movie, and though it looks like a flop on the outside, the right movie student will find out how good it is. This movie is real.
