Kudos to the director and cast for such a realistic film. The rudeness, the lack of glamor and despair pulled me into the movie and held me there. I was really impressed with how data and information was transmitted in the film. That is, newspapers, letters, etc. The movie moved so fast that I did not feel the urge to move forward. I personally thought that all the principles have done an excellent job. It was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. Sometimes I wanted to cry. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... His achievements of this kind usually impress me. Overall, this is a brilliant movie you should not miss!
