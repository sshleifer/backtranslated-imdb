Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice, and devotion to a noble cause, but it's neither preaching nor boring. It just never gets old, though I've seen it more than 15 times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis is a joy in one of her few really sympathetic roles. The children are, as Granny says, more like "dressed dwarfs" than children, but that just makes them more enjoyable to watch. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, everyone would be up for this movie.
