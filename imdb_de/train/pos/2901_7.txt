Tiempo de Valientes blends seamlessly into the buddy action film genre, but transcends its roots with superb casting, a tremendous connection between its leading roles and outstanding photography. Diego Peretti plays the lead role as Dr. Silverstein, a shrink driver who rode the gun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque). He is said to investigate the murder of two smaller hoods that appeared to be involved in a conspiracy of arms smuggling. Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he is the best man for this job and must have professional psychiatric help to get back into action. Silverstein and Diaz are soon involved in a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence agencies and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point where Silverstein can develop some formidable sleep skills. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of the screen crew Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti is not as classic-looking as Hill. It is noteworthy that Tiempo de Valientes, even with a duration of nearly two hours, does not worsen his greeting, and writer-director Damian Szifron puts up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda. All in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither complains the lowest common denominator nor offends your intelligence.
