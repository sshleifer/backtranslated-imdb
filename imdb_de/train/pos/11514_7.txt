Not the most successful television project John Cleese has ever made: "Strange Case" has the feel of a first draft that went into production before any revisions could be made. There are a few stupid ideas and even a few clever ideas, but the story as a whole does not matter much. Arthur Lowe is a scream, like Dr. Bits and everything. "Good God."
