I liked this movie so much that I looked at it twice. This is something about a documentation. The music, the cinematography and the sound are absolutely impressive, as one might expect from an imax production. Although shot for the big Imax cinemas, it looks wonderful on my home system. In fact, this would be a perfect DVD to demonstrate your system. <br /> <br /> The theme is so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I've already been a fan of Mario because he's the best race car ride in history, being the only one to win the CART Championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500, and the Indianapolis 500. The father and son The first car is located in a chicken coop and proves to be the first roadster Mario ever drove, and we follow the restoration in brilliant perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car, and we're following it to cut the shape during the racing season. Imax offers just the right magic to make vehicle construction entertaining and fascinating. Paul Newman, who was the team owner of Michael Amoretti at the time of making this film, tells the film. His anecdotes and his joke, for many years as owner and driver, give the production a lot. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the racing scenes. Increase the volume here! It's just over 200 miles per hour to drive and the music that draws you completely into the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, loves his father, who watches proudly for his son's career. They work so well together that every father and son should see that. It can be said that they are a close family. I wish we all could have that experience.
