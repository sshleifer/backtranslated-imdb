The film focuses mainly on a bullying Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with it. It is in the middle of a hunt for fewer and fewer buffaloes, marks the end of a tragic era of pointless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivety that the buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal after animal, while in another Indian Indian is murdered and then eaten the food that they had prepared on their fire. Beneath this reckless appearance lies an insecure person who merely begs his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It's not the most enjoyable of the movies and is weighted down by the drama it produces, resulting in a bleak and very fitting ending in the blizzard.
