What a funny B-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is unique and original. He really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s. The budget is obviously low and not everyone is behind the lens Pacino, but it does not matter, because it never takes seriously. From the trailer trash can to the scarecrow's high-flying martial arts moves, this is a true B-movie gem. Grab refreshments, snacks and a few friends and sit back. I liked this movie so much that I bought all three Scarecrow movies. Sure, they are not something for everyone, but their own. Sometimes you just have to put on the hat and smile.
