I stumbled upon the re-syndication of this show a few years ago and fell in love with it. It shows TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and made me laugh, one episode at a time. I think it was not that big and was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good run and I would suggest watching it ... when the opportunity arises.
