I really liked this show - we had the first and only, as it seems, a series in the UK on Channel 4. The characterization was right for the money - a bit like the Simpsons, as all the different facets of the small town population were represented. <br /> <br /> There was no laughter - I had not seen it in an American television comedy then, except for Larry Sanders. It worked really well here, reinforcing the hint that these crazy cops were this. I really like that and not just for the cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a weird little number that tickled me correctly: I can not help but believe that it may be indicative of certain audiences. I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK, if it had been shown at an acceptable time. <br /> <br /> I will round this off with my standard commentary: Where can I get this done? Check it out again Any ideas?
