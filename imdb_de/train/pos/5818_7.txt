Actually, this movie has stupid moments in both the Claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and Children-Part, and it's a lot worse than other MJ movies like The Wiz, Captain Eo and Ghosts. But as a die-hard Michael Jackson fan for almost eleven years (yes, that's my half life, you guys!), I can not complain too much about it. Just seeing this beautiful man and hearing his wonderful music is a journey to heaven for me. But as a movie that's not good at all, and I'm afraid it would give me a worse grade if my darling Mike had not been the lead actor. But since nobody except Mike is the Moonwalker, he has to get a 7 out of 10 points from me.
