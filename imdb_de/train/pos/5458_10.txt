I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to any period of American history. There is always this woman who does what she needs to do to scale the class system. I feel that Lilly's character has been properly portrayed and could not be improved. I liked it the most when she realized what love really is. Throughout the film, all the men in love with her were in love with her, giving her everything, even losing her career to her. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these men had given up everything to be happy. The way her life ended was far from expected. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a mature audience so you can understand the content and meaning of the movie and the plot.
