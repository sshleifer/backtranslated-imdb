"El Mar", directed by the Catalan director Agusti Villarona, based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse into the Spanish story of a Balearic author who transports spectators to the time of civil war in this country. The film focuses on three friends and follows them from the beginning of the war in Mallorca to a few years later, when two of these friends meet again when they are in a rural sanatorium lost. <Br /> <br /> First we meet three guys who play happily. Not everything is as it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of the one who commits the evil deed. The boys have excluded a young girl, about her age, from participating in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet the adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his childhood friends, is also being treated, and the young girl, who has not been invited to participate in her games, is now one of the nuns supervising her health care. It is obvious that Tur sees Ramallo as he is in love only with the hard bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job portraying the older Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable teenager. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca out of conviction. Angela Molina appears as Carmen, the wife of the janitor of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that shows Agusti Villarona's talents to bring the novel to life for the beholder.
