This is the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie on Dutch TV sometime in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> This month a Yugoslav film was shown every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> Next week, there was another great movie (with a train instead of a bus) that I do not remember naming. If you know it, please let me know! How can I definitely see this movie again? A DVD of this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Next week, there was another great movie (with a train instead of a bus) whose name I do not remember. If you know it, please let me know!
