OK, first a correction of the tag on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go with his sister in the movie and did not stop at his sister's grave. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was very close to Lincoln in New Salem. Some say Ann was indeed Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. <br /> <br /> Now there are inventions and fictionalizations in this film. Hollywood has always earned dramatic licenses with something under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. The process in the courtroom that is in the film, however, is based on a real event: the murder charges against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although he is largely invented in this movie with many name changes, he will still be thrilled the screen. This is Hollywood's golden age, with drama at its best, and Henry Fonda may be the best Lincoln played by anyone.
