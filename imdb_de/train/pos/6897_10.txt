It was released on DVD in France several years ago - I wish it was re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake of Penelope Cruz that gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer who tells a fortune teller he will marry the king's daughter. He goes to the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a big loss for Moviedom.
