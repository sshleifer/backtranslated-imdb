There are numerous films that relate to World War II, but Mother Night is very different: In this film, we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin who lives with a German, Helga Noth (Lee). Married To accept the role of a spy: A CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest ranks of the Hitler regime. The deal, however, is that for national security reasons, the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war, and so Campbell becomes a hated personality in the US. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past comes back and persecutes him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply touching as we hear the tragedy of Campbell Watching a great patriot is treated with contempt by all who surround him. Not only that, he also gradually realizes that even the people closest to him have many secrets. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, increasing Campbell's despair and almost strangling the viewer. <br/> <br/> Nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion. he is even better than "Affliction," though in both roles he plays tragic characters destined for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same applies to the entire cast in general. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book and therefore can not judge how the film is comparable to it. In any case, this is not important here: my criticism is the film itself and the film earns a whopping 9/10.
