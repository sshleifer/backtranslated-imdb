Anyone who has seen this movie and rated it bad, I refer to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the industry's most respected critics and gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. A Chorus Line is less a story than a group of stories about the life of Broadway fans. I read reviews in which people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. That's a wrong view. It's a different story, along with all the other stories told about every Broadway hopefuls. People do not know that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things the ordinary man goes through. And I think that's really the point of the whole show. It's not just about presenting the talent of these special dancers, but also telling us some poignant things about life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star looks at this movie with a great sense of relationship because he has gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points and is sometimes a little confused with the pace of certain storylines, but overall I really liked it. Take a closer look at the movie and you might understand what I'm talking about.
