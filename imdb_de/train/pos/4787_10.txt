David Lynch usually makes movies that resemble puzzles that have been put together incorrectly. They are interesting to look at and think about, but they really are not in your head. Maybe art will always mean the best for its creator. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Not that there is anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A true life journey Alvin Straight took a lawnmower to get to his brother's house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa, to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to make amends for his ailing brother for past crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film is Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight straight to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the movie is slow fits with Alvin's slower realization. <br /> <br /> On the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to escape her situation. After Alvin overhears talking about family, she thinks about it later. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin experiences a distraught woman killing a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad, but is smart enough to make some meat that night. Later Alvin's mower loses his brakes and almost kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their garden while he fixes it. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, who was dogged by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin says thankfully. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a kind old man, talking about the severity of the war and the price he needs for his soul. Alvin even admits a deadly mistake he made as a sniper who persecuted him forever. Alvin also meets two bickering brothers who have repaired his lawnmower. He persuades them cheaply and asks them for their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them appreciate each other by learning from his own mistakes with his brother. In the night, before Alvin leaves the man's yard, he takes off his hat. The man tells him that it is an honor for him to stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It is heartfelt because it is so straightforward and genuine. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can not help but be more and more interested. We want Alvin to come to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last movie and his performance was incredible. They can not help but understand their pride, listen to their wisdom, and ultimately feel their pain. He is as enthusiastic about him as the man who offers him his backyard. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are sitting in a bar together. I can imagine them talking about their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the movie, "My brother and I watched the stars." Well, I know that they all have the best view in the house.
