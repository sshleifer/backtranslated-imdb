Let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE, gaping holes in the plot and questions that are raised and that are not coming near where you do not accept them. 2) The movie is not for all people, so rude viewers get restless and start knocking during the movie. <br /> <br /> Point two above is important as the movie is very quiet. In an older theater (like the one I was in) you can sometimes hear the scrolling through the projector. I loved that. The movie does not bother you with music or effects: it lets you think about what's going on. <br /> <br /> It lacks a rhythm that creates an atmosphere that is fascinating and extremely enjoyable. The same atmosphere that Stanley Kubrick created in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend Kinofans, as the cinematography is amazing. Those who base their appreciation for a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story you have to follow in hindsight. (My version of it is damn cool, but probably quite off!) If you look at the movie, there is a very cool part: when the two policemen talk on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person who thought of it.
