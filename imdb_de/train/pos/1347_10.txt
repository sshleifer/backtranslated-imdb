Big, comprehensive and passionate summary of American cinema from the point of view of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say, there is never a boring moment in all of its 4 hours of running time. Many genres, epochs and directors are explored and discussed from the perspective of Cinephilus rather than the contemporary director. For those who are interested only in American films or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of the BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
