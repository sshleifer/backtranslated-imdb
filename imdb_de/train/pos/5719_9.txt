As I've already noted with many IMDb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that any movie they see has smug, intelligent plans that wallow in their own wisdom. I do not belong to these people. When I see an action movie, I want to see explosions, shots, and exploits. When I watch a comedy, I want tears of laughter in my eyes. You have the idea. So when I watch a horror movie, I want to be scared of everything. The Grudge is a very scary movie, both in well-executed "jump" scenes and in spooky pictures. I've been a horror movie fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters like Dario Argento, not the directors of some of the treadmill teen horror movies that are left out today. If you want to be afraid, watch this movie. Insane than the original Japanese "ring" (which I also consider a great movie).
