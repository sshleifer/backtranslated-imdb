This is a nice example of how an interesting movie can be made without big stars and big effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African-American women in a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This movie invites us all to look at our personal prejudices and see that people are human, not white, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with good news.
