After seeing Vertigo, you'll see Bell, Book, and Candle made within a few months. <br /> <br /> My second favorite movie by Kim Novak, with Picnic as third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo is the best of them all. <br /> <br /> They came to my nowhere near Kansas Prairie, Salina, Kansas in the 50s to film Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle's music score, I think, is one of Alex Norths. Perfect for this bit of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak made this comedy, how amusing to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth it if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
