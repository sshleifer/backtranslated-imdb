This movie was played very well in 1932 and probably will not work so well today as it is a bit old-fashioned and resourceful. However, if you're the kind of guy who loves older Hollywood movies, cut the movie a bit and enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The film is set up in a problematic pregnancy ward. There are about half a dozen beds in this large room where women are waiting to be born - but the doctors are worried about possible complications (Yikes - such a room would really traumatize the mothers!). And like every episode of Love Boat or Fantasy Island, every mother has her own story. With so many extreme and crazy stories you have to expose unbelief. I could and did enjoy the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories: One concerns a father. You do not see the mother, but he is a very, very nervous dad and it is included for the comic relief. But he was wonderful here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is taken from the prison to the hospital - she apparently killed a terrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume that he tried to impose himself on her! Nevertheless, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison - and her husband is dedicated to her and stands her as far as he can. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has the maternal instincts of a hamster - a really bad and alcoholic hamster! It's pretty funny and it's worth watching most of the movie. I loved it when she drank from a gin-filled hot water bottle and got annoyed when she found out she could not make any money selling her twins !! Later in the film, she has a typical Hollywood-style change that should be touching - I've succeeded. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a still-born baby. Amazingly, they then put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to be born !!! A crazy woman you suspected a while ago of having lost a baby goes down from the psychiatric ward. She insists she has a baby. Later she escapes again and actually takes one of the children with her! <br /> <br /> There are more stories than these, but the ones I mentioned are the most important ones. Like I said, it's a kind of soap opera and very entertaining - and quite sad for some stories. Especially the end is heartbreaking and exceptionally well done. There were some particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as head nurse. All in all a very good movie - and I have no idea why they felt they were making the movie just a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
