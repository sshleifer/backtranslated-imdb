Japan is in serious trouble. Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of the demons, is near. The only thing that stands in the way of this serious threat is the Demon Wardens, a formidable group of warriors who can be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo, a retired demon guard who was five years ago, recorded theater instead of demon battles after he left By mistake, an innocent child had been killed (in a battle strangely reminiscent of the Dusk to Dawn bar scene). One night, by accident, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortune is (in the truest sense of the word) intertwined and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like a typical Japanese fantasy / swordplay epic, you're wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical for Ashura. It is a refuge of many different film genres. The just mentioned, as well as a comedy, a drama and a romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre quite respectfully (though the comedy seems compelled in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really funny popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Of course there is the mistake in the movie. Part of the humor seems wrong and inappropriate. And the spectacle is not the greatest. But seriously, are you watching fantasy / swordplay / comedy films for the great acting performances? No, we're watching her for the action and crazy CG visuals Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the movie is not all action, but it's liberal enough with lots of swordplay and bucketfuls of green blood to make the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Conclusion; The film has its faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it does not try to be, offering interesting visuals and good sword fighting action. The reason the movie worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the spectator does the same, he's sure to love this funny and silly sword fighting action-action movie. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
