Ok, it may not be the award winning "Film of the Year" movie (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won some awards), but it's a really great movie about "The Kid" (Prince / (Choose your choice) and the happenings around him who live in Minneapolis and play his music.The music is absolutely great.My opinion, you MUST own this soundtrack, it is really a classic and sums up the eighties Sounds and feeling together wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays a nice action, it is always worth watching, especially if you like Prince / O (which I like of course).
