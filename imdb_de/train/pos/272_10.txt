But it still loved nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was well presented, with the choice of actors who take their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes excited the imagination and created a thrill. The progression of situations was cleverly written, leading me to believe that history had only one way, just to find a new twist that I thought could be obvious. Too bad that there must be commercials. I've told many friends to look for more screenings, and of course I'll see them again. I enjoyed the scenery of the movie and felt it contributed to the plot and the intrigue. The heated discussions between husband and wife (or should I say, fighting?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but the escalation into history is fortunately not shown. I want to thank everyone who participated in this great entertaining movie. Many Thanks! I'm looking forward to the next films - when? Whidbey
