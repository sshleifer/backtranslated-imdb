This film draws you so deeply into the two main characters. I put it in my laptop without reading the cover (let alone the reviews) and was fascinated for two hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that spreads between a secretary and a criminal is almost tangible even without physical contact. Towards the end I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and our heroine to pull their caprices or just to accomplish their passion. RML could have done without a weird subplot, and traditional 100 minutes would have been ample. I do not do any picks. After a series of Netflix, blockbuster, and local library duds, this movie has restored my confidence in the great movies.
