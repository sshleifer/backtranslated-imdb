Like many, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many others here, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thought out. Everything about it is an offshoot that should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons in which a single villain tries to defeat the good. By using the well-known Shaggy and Scooby Doo characters, it's much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humor from the start in each 30-minute episode that annoyed fans. The classic is the Scooby Shaggy Scrappy shorts from the 80s. These spin-offs had their place: they sold new content, created new fans and kept Scooby Doo merchandise on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: get a hint!" does not fit this traditional role, but I've probably always wanted the Scooby Shaggy Scrappy shorts: an action-packed show featuring the best / funniest Scooby Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad guys, the "best friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Poor Features: None, though the revamped Mystery Machine is sometimes pretty close. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
