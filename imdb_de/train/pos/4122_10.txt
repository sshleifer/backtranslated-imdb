I would like to see a resurrection of an outdated Seahunt series with the technology they have today. It would revive the excitement of the children in me My voice for a comeback of a new hunt. We need a change on television, and this would work for a world of underwater adventures. Many movies. Anyway, I think I have what I want to say. It would be nice to read a few more pluses about the sea hunt in case of doubt and have I stop, if so, I have to go, so let's do it.
