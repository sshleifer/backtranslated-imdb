- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), weary of the rat race and cramped living conditions in New York City, finds land in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find the simple life. But building a house is anything but easy. When the headaches and the bills start, the laughter piles up too. Will Mr. Blanding ever get his dream home? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film special is the three main characters - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Each of three is able to carry a movie alone. So when you combine your talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this role. He is so good at playing the husband. Loy is always a pleasure to see. The William Powell-created Thin Man films are almost perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine for the past two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a special favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I think it's great to imagine a time when you could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom home with an income of $ 15,000 a year. Imagine the fact that your two children attend a private school and you have a chambermaid, and it becomes almost imaginative. <br /> <br /> - For anyone who has bought or built a house, many situations and predicaments in which the Blanding are, are still easy to understand today. And here comes the comedy into play. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple is doing in this movie just to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole subplot "Woman in love with the best friend". It really is not necessary for the plot and feels inappropriate and very uncomfortable as pictured.
