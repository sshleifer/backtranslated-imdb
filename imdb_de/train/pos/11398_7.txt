I enjoyed this movie. It was carefree, adorable and very colorful. You see that MGM showed Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. Every scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that the dances can tell the story as well as anything else. The last section of the movie, the big dance sequence, is very impressive. The special feature of this film is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had a better gift for the tune. I really like Gershwin's music. It is adorable. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyricists. He is so funny and charming. This was a very entertaining movie.
