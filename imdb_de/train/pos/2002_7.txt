To a certain extent, I actually liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRES. I found this movie pretty misogynistic. As a woman and horror fan, I'm used to the fact that women in danger are a genre of the genre. But they just beat Sheryl Lee too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a fully realized character, and the main villain is a girl! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very beyond and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yeah, not a great actor, but he's doing fine. At least he does not start singing. Catch it on the cable if you can. It's on Encore Action this month.
