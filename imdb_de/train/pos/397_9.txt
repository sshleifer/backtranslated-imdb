I have to admit that Tsui Hark is unique. You can not beat a person with a strong film presence. A Chinese fantasy image may not be easy to present to an audience, the director has been trying to bring back the classic fantasy stories of Zu Mountain, and that's what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new legend of Zu has really improved from the year 1983. From this new millennium update we were able to see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu Mountains. Spectacular visual designs, a fantastic action fantasy epic that is beautiful. I stuck myself through the whole picture. Great cast with good acting. It's really an entertaining movie, but is it too funny? <br /> <br /> Well, people will definitely be confused with their broad story, which will be shortened into a 95-minute movie. The plot may not have much relationship between the characters, but if you watch the movie again, you will have a better understanding of the characters. Some can complain that there are not too many physical struggles. Aside from characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, ghosts fighting hand in hand make no sense. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this beautiful stylish picture. It may have a thin history, but look over at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we were also puzzled by the plot, but it was really something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always draws something else in H.K. Movie theater. The American public may have difficulty understanding this movie as this is not a squatting tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is a completely new genre. It's not a masterpiece, but its special effects are really better than Storm Riders. It's really worth it.
