SERIES 1 <br /> <br /> As the UK eagerly awaits the launch of the second series of "Lost", the first series (which has just been completed) did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> A group of over forty passengers have difficulty getting over the plane after they crash on a desert island. They pray for salvation. But as the days become weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest, they begin to wonder if they are alone.

Nevertheless, the series manages to catch up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the last episode. Perhaps the biggest thing about 'Lost' is that we visit each character's life before crashing into a series of flashbacks. This gives us more insight and thus more excitement as the events evolve in the present. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this show is an excellent combination of drama, suspense and the supernatural. it's just not to be missed. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR SEASON 1 FOLLOWS <br /> <br /> SERIES 2 <br /> <br /> After the Cliffhanger, this was the end of Series 1 of "Lost", Series 2 starts with our protagonists, who dive deep into the heart of the Hatch phenomenon.
