I think most people who posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. To evaluate a movie, you first need to understand how everything in the movie works together. Modern sensations require a big drama. No, I do not mean great attitudes to characters and actions, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are very tragic or comedic. This is a subtle movie. Their beauty lies in their fineness (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It's a beautifully filmed movie combining sensuality, politics, human weakness, and venality. The world she is in would be foreign and not understood today. A world in which you must flaunt it NOW and LOUD, even if you only think it had it Today you do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people now understand that term. <br /> <br /> This film helps to set the record number.
