I immediately fell in love with Pushing Daisies. This show manages to put a smile on my face with her great storytelling, witty dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: you also succeed in holding you to the end. The basic idea of ​​the show - bringing people back to life with one touch, ending the undead status with one second - is interesting and could be in later seasons. But the exciting murder cases, the unique appearance of the show and the highly qualified storyteller complete the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than just a part of it. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy, and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
