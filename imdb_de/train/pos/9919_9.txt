Fascinating, breathtaking and terrible, this breathtakingly beautiful film is the "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slowly, calmly in the mood, there are good insights into the poisoned places of the earth, which can be signs of an inevitable fatality. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my mind - nature is plagued and we are the disease greed, the essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has made us something like cancer on the Way to consume the host and to die with him ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes created are an unforgettable prospect experience - at least I never see my toaster again and iron in the same way again.
