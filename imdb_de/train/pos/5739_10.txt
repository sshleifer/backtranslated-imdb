Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this outstanding example of brotherly love and devotion. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky), a slightly mentally handicapped young man who brings his 12-minute younger twin brother Liotta, who plays Eugene, to medical school. Located in Baltimore, it addresses the issues of sibling rivalries, the indestructible union of twins, child molestation, and the overcoming of evil. It is captivating and full of laughter and tears. If you have not seen this movie yet, lend it please, I promise, you'll be amazed how such a wonderful movie can not be noticed.
