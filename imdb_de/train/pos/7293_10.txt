What do I say to such an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw that in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering that this is my capital. I'm a science fiction fan and I like action movies. I was awake all night and just wanted to call a day when I saw this movie in the morning. This is not a sci-fi movie or action movie. Let me start by saying that I am neither a fan of Witchblade nor of Eric Etebari, having seen a few episodes (his performance seemed old and robotic). But he has managed to really convince me with this achievement. I really mean to convince myself. After seeing Cellular, I did not think there was much to do for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was amazing. He was extremely convincing as the evil demon. But there were so many detailed details about this figure that I was absolutely thrilled. Later, I looked online and found that Eric won the award for the best performer who deserved to be deserved of his best working life and earned my respect. Now I keep reading about the background and the production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very well done, but I was even more impressed by the story - which, in my opinion, was even more of his goal (watching movies like Godzilla with big effects really ticked me off). I could not sleep after this movie and kept thinking in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed my girlfriend's trailer online and she almost cried because it made her feel like she was abusing. This is a movie I am constantly thinking about and I highly recommend it.
