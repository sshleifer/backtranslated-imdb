Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually it is incredible. Everything else was just fine. <br /> <br /> For the movie, I think the movie is fantastic, but I like everything Burton did. People need to calm down and stop behaving as if it were the end of the world of this movie. It should not be a remake and it is not like that. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. , I saw it as a parallel universe.
