I just wish the Jedi's return was led by another director, I mean, there are far too many ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Apart from that time, our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia does not fight solo anymore, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before and Yoda just dies I'm going on in this episode, which I just do can not hate. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers 1- Jabba the hat 2- The assault sequence of the sailing ship. 3-The Emperor (now it's evil) 4- The Speeders hunt the endor forest. 5 - The Final Battle 6-The Dark Side Seduction Scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can bring tears to their eyes. If some scenes had been cut and another director had been hired, it would have been just as perfect as in Episodes 4 and 5, but still exceptional. 9 out of 10.
