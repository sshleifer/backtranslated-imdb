I think this is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. The script of Robert Harling is almost perfect. Just look at the "quotes". Just think about renting the DVD, because it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing. Sally Field offers a weird, superior performance you've never seen before, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly funny. Robert Downey, Jr. is generally brilliant, and in a very minor role, Kathy Najimy is a rebellion as a harassed customer. I've never been a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as she's the only person surrounded by a plethora of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun So Sets" in the Tomb. Either that or he laughs very hard , <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
