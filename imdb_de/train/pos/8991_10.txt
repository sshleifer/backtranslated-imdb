DIG! is funny, funny, amusing, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that it was done on such a low budget over 7 years is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such a style and content. If you're a music or documentary fanatic, this is a must. <br /> <br /> The focus on The Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is an excellent way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets, with modest success through persistence and the ability to compromise and one Ingenious megalomaniac singer supported by various characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that this was footage of real people, I would swear that it is an incredibly well written and imaginative script. The story is convincing, concise and simply stunning.
