I've seen tons of HK-actioners, and this one is at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetical as anything you've ever seen in an action movie. The kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics breathtaking, the stunts are heartbreaking. The processing is perfectly coordinated, increases the tension and complements the work with the liquid camera. This film is directed by veteran pro Corey Yuen, whose CV is filled with some of the best work in the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If anything is missing in this film, it is the presence of a three-dimensional figure, even though Martin, the male lead actor, comes closest to him. This movie is full of archetypes and not characters - the sexy killer, the stupid thief and his bitchy girlfriend, the cackling villains. That said, Shannon Lee has a terrific screen presence. She's great with the fighting, the stunts and the weapons. When she's on the screen, it's hard to take her eyes off her. She is so good. Why is not this woman a star?
