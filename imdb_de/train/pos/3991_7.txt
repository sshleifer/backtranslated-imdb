"If I sit down, I'll never get up again," says the mother (the one of the title) to his son when he tells her to rest (she's just widowed). He says that rest must be done by a woman of his age and in her situation: resting in peace, neglecting oneself. But she's not in the mood for "rest," not yet. She also has a daughter who accuses her of every disaster in her life ... Suddenly comes the revelation: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter, 30 years her junior (Daniel Craig, the brand new James Bond) than she thought "nobody would ever touch her again". It's a story that makes you think about many things, especially about what a woman has to do with her life when his husband dies. It does not seem that we have progressed so far in these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were different? An old woman, a young man ... no, you're not ready, right? The film has intimistic sounds everywhere, except for two or three sequences in which the notes are located and there are some explicit dialogues. These vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter find out their mother's love affair (quite absurd - you'll know what I mean when you see it -) are the only inconsistent elements in The Mother. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
