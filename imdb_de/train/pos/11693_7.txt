This movie is a remake of two movies that were much better. The last, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see this one. This is not great. The last third of the movie is not that bad and Chris Rock is now showing some of the comic humor that has brought him to the current state. I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It runs like a really bad "B" movie in which people sound like a bad TV sit-com. The situations are forced and it's as if they're just trying to finish the story so they can start the right movie. It all seems to be really fake and the editing is just bad. I do not know how they could release this movie like this. Anyway, the last part is not that bad, so wait for the video and then watch it.
