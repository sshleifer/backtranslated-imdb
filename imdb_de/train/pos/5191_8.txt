Scott is right. The best two-person sword duel ever made on film is right in the middle of this movie. The sword fights with several fighters are not the best, although they are pretty good. However, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai films. In my opinion, Chinese sword fighting scenes have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a man has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese films are excellent, for example, the series Lone Wolf and Cub. Even if duels in Japanese cinema last only seconds or at most a minute, they have made better by the intensity of these moments. However, this is an example where the Chinese sword fighting surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute fight with the most amazing choreography of all time. The other fights in this movie are also good, but even if they suck this movie would get a 7 for this one scene. If you have not seen it, you must. John Woo is the man.
