Nicely done. A lot of fear. Friendship may not take everything, but in the end everything that a group of friends learns matters. I have seen it again and again. The music is also incredible. When Kei loses the one friend he has, he gives up until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not repulsed by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, they fight for their own place in the midst of a melting pot of Asian races and learn that sometimes it costs a little more than you ever have to pay. A surprising ending that works just as well as the whole movie. I could not get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do a wonderful job as an actress, proving that they are more than pretty boys singing.
