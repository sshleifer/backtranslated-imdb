What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, one can assume that it is filled with action. <br /> <br /> The latest film by producer Bruckheimer, Gone in 60 Seconds, is all about nomenclature. With character monsters like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars that are idealized with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's just the non-stop action that keeps you from playing just the name game. <br /> <br /> No deep script, but it's a great way to do something, with Nicolas Cage and Memphis Raines coming out of car-arrest together with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall to save his brother's life, by having a list of 50 people stealing exotic cars in one night. As a remake of the cult hit of 1974, this film may not be for the same cult status, but it's entertaining. Surprisingly, it's the action that does not watch you act. Although star-laden, none of them performed well, including a very poor performance by one of my favorite colleagues, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who just won her Oscar, is just a love interest that has little time. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and the chases they operate make a great movie? I think so. The movie is a pleasure, and though a particular scene leads you into the realm of unbelief, the action is uninterrupted and the tension is compelling. Be careful when other riders fight for pole position when leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5 points
