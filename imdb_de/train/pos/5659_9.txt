AG was an outstanding presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare on American television. Sheriff Lucas gave the Willies to many spectators. We searched for Caleb as he struggled to fight Sheriff Lucas's cockiness. We were stunned and scared as we discovered the unimaginable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that gave weekly worries about what Lucas would do next were really surprising. This show experienced the "Gothic" nickname in a way that American entertainment has rarely tried, let alone master. The suits definitely made a big mistake when they did not support this show. This show is a shame for the current glut of "reality" shows that are less than satisfying to look at. This show is quality consideration for a demanding market that is starving for quality consideration. An audience suffering from the supersaturation of insane reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. Bring the DVD box with you!
