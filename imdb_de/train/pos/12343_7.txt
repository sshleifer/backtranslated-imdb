Artistically, this is a beautiful movie - the cinematography, music and costumes are great. In fact, this film is more beautiful than the one by Akira Kurasawa himself director. In this case, he wrote the film only as it was written several years after his death. <br /> <br /> Well, as far as writing is concerned, the dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes interesting. The story, however, was quite depressing, but in some ways indissoluble - after all, it is a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, while prostitution is considered a far more acceptable business in Japan, women still seek a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, although Streets Of Shames characters are much less sympathetic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Overall, it gets a 7 - mostly because of everything, BUT the writing. It is a pity that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
