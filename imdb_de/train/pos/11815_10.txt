At the time I write this, I see a rating of 5.8 out of over 15,000 votes. Something is wrong with this picture. Personally, I give a 10th. I can see a 7th lowest or a possible 8th, if rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on a comic book hero. This film won more than its share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations ... that's where it tells me it's better than a 5.8. Some great plays by some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be a classic, if not for years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to visit Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can see more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as a Big Boy Caprice.
