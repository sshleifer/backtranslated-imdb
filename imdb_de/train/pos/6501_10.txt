If you want to get everything you want to know about World War II from different perspectives with this DVD, you're guaranteed to learn new things, so you do not need any more documentary on the subject. Get it, look at it, learn from it. Good for the school. As a bonus you can watch this with Tora Tora Tora. They're saving private Ryan, Patton, a group of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day, and other World War II episodes. Sir Laurence Oliver's voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26-part series. Seriously, there is no better documentary from the Second World War on this subject. PERFECT 10 !!!
