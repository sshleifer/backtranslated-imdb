This movie is really special. It is a very nice movie. What with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and her friend Toshi, starts are poor children living on the street, but one day, they were able to steal a bag full of money, and then they could go on living, to buy a house, and her life seems to be getting much better. They make new friends, life friends. But something went wrong and they become enemies and it all ends in killing each other. <br /> <br /> I was initially negative because singer (Gackt - Solo, former lead singer) in Malice Mizer, Hyde - solo singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee -Hom (Taiwanese singer)) who is trying to become an actor, but this is not like the other singer-actors movies. They do a great job and have no previous experience with movies (except Lee-Hom, who had previously starred in two films). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's a bit because I am, but a very big fan of Hyde - it was this film that brought me to discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (the main character - the orphan Sho) was part of the group that wrote the script, and he insisted that Hydeo's friend, the vampire Kei, play. At that time, they did not know each other, at least not like friends. But after the movie they were really good friends, and that shows us that they have worked really hard on this film and had good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The film has many different emotions that run through the story, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first lesson is the best, it's so nice. After that, people die, Kei goes and everything changes so much. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends so sad, but still nice. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you should really do it. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
