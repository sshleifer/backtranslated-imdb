Weak start, solid middle, fantastic finish. At least that's my impression of this movie. I liked Simon Pegg in the two movies I saw him in - Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. Shows his spectrum as an actor, but still I did not really like the character because he was portrayed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor that I call "frustration comedy". The alleged "jokes" and the joke are really nothing but painful and unpleasant moments. Similar to the bean figure that Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters. I do not want to bomb her here, so not. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you're like me and slick and insanely agonizing idiots, Pegg for the first time shows such features third of this movie. It gets better, though. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Could be. The story of the movie stopped being annoying and became the triumph of the "little man" in the last third. I do not need all the movies to be sugar and light - but by chance, as this movie got better, it also became more and more a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play such a masterful role. I liked Iron Man, but was saddened that Bridge's character was a villain. A purely personal taste, of course, because he was great at it. Nonetheless, as the visionary of Bigger Than Life, the publisher of Sharps, he was a miracle. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall I liked it! I only wish I had come in 40 minutes late and missed the start.
