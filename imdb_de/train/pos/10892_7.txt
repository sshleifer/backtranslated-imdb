What is not to like about this movie? Every year you know that during the Christmas season you get one or two Christmas flood movies and most of them will be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that has been pretty well deducted. A very funny version of a rich young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What's the good thing about having something like that if you can not do funny things with it? It was a win-win situation. A normal family gets six figures and a rich man can experience Christmas the way he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly hard to deal with and it was just an uprising when the family reluctantly pursued his absurd demands. It was a funny and funny movie.
