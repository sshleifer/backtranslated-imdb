At the San Francisco International Film Festival on 25, 26 and 27 April 2001 under the title "Come Undone" shown. The cameraman uses techniques that complement storytelling. Even with the backgrounds in autumn / winter for the present and the spring summer for the "flashbacks", continuity can lead to difficulties in real life; from physical violence to each other to their passionate lovemaking. The story draws you slowly into the characters at first. But as the end approaches, you really care where these guys will be next summer! You also want a sequel to find out.
