This show probably will not please everyone. Sarah does what she wants; She does not ask for permission and does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male cheerleaders stealing purses. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can not appreciate the unconventional humor, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It combines the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The comedians), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's stay) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also highlights the best talents of the emerging online community, channel101.com. (If you're interested in this show, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 this March, it's pulled from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Check out the show from Sarah Silverman. This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment.
