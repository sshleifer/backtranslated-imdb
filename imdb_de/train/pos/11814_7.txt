When we use the word "escapist," we usually mean it negatively. Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" movie version shows that "escapist" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As the same-named, fearless title character dressed in yellow, Beatty creates a detective we can all relate to: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses, a world apart. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect from the man of a criminal. The breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most amazing person you can imagine; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include the language-challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also play a role. Oh, wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and so far failed - to find a way to find Big Boy. At the same time, some very bizarre events have been held in the city, whose answers may or may not be closer than anyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the most important thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty struggled to maintain his age, he made good use of it. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
