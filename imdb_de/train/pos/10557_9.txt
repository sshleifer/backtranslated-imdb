I just saw it at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was funny and a bit surreal. Take place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this rundown house in the midst of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just great, because the two losers who wish the world would just disappear. The acting, the dialogue and the writing are very good and the whole movie looks good for such a low budget movie. The director / author Vincenzo Natali was present at this screening, and he seemed so intelligent and down-to-earth. This guy is so resourceful with these great stories that work so well in small budgets that he shames the big-budget Hollywood crap!
