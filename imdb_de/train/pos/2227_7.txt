This will get reviews on the whole map, as it does not fit in any shape. It's horror - but not a splatterfest. It's equally suspense and horror - but without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky cameras. <br /> <br /> The feeling of the film is thrifty and slim with almost no special effects, because I think you should listen to the faces of the characters and watch them. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy Universe. This is a red herring. He acts here. "Camp" is a misunderstanding of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is doing a very solid job - so she has to believe that the script has something to say. We all know the sad excuses that the actors obviously no longer care about, just waiting for the director to cut and get their paychecks. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive that the bodies begin to fall with an almost random regularity. I do not think the intent was funny - but to upset you. <br /> <br /> Think less of a horror "movie" and more of a horror "play" on a stage - this run-down, whitewashed house. Then you might see that it really is about paranoia, fear and crazy madness, located in an isolated place in the US. <br /> <br /> And it's confused. Time travel, mind control, secret experiments and Nazis who are NOT dead. , I say, rent it and try it if you are in the mood for something small brain. This would be a good choice for a Saturday midnight sitting.
