A recent ad by THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has made me look at many of the classic MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a smaller movie than ON THE TOWN. The songs are not as good as the chemistry between the characters. But the film wonderfully combines classic favorites like Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl, where Sinatra and Kelly show up out of the woods and then run down the stairs while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the movie, even though the scene is in Kelly's with Jerry Mouse dances, is more famous. Lovers of classical music will undoubtedly identify the music played by the pianists. Sinatra then sings, "I fall in love too easily" before he has his epiphany that he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with mountains and eco-friendly air (can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid-1940s ?!), and the piano music is absolutely gorgeous. MGM certainly had a sense of creating such lyrical moments.
