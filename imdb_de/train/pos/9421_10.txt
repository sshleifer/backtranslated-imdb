Contains * Spoiler * - even my quotes may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone is always aware of the satire in social commentary and in economic parallels - how true. But for me, I see this movie much more than that. I love the symbolism of this man in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and dirt in the world around him, but it does not hang. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grin and eternal curiosity are so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "That's awesome - can you tell me, what's the ratio of ink to gas?" > <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention did not work - almost naked there. More than a shame, however, is the simple disappointment that "it did not work". He is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we also want to stop it." <br /> <br /> He hesitates for a moment before trying to get away. Does he show any signs of the pain that such a betrayal has caused? <br /> <br /> The role of Dapne is also remarkable. She has enough of money and power. She believes she has finally found love outside of her father's company. At first, she does not care about Sidney anymore than for everyone else. But the moment he falls off her car and she goes back to see if she may have killed him - and all the while he is only thinking of the beauty of his invention. She has finally found something that she believes is worth living. The funny thing is that it's not even a romance. It's friendship, but so fleeting that the title almost does not fit. It's more admiration and maybe even inspiration. After discovering that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is totally incompetent to take care of her, she cynicizes and tries to calm herself. Sidney Fortunately, she realizes that there are really people in this world who live for more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you, Sidney, if you had said yes, I would probably have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I love the end. If all this crazy business seems to come to nothing. But then the bubbly, quirky beat starts and Sidney starts, his step matching the melody: undaunted. Where is Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and she was not a scientist. He got help with the escape and she got "a shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A continued relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I had hoped ..." <br /> <br />
