If an actor plays the role of an actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much harder to play than a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman excelled as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He put all his talent and sincerity into this character. The countenance, manners, gait, and attitude spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was experiencing as he played Othello on stage. Coleman was also extremely successful as a Shakespearean actor in the short scenes as Othello, who were part of this movie jewel. The faces of Coleman's face as Othello, tormented by doubts about the loyalty of Desdemona, were in themselves scenes worth seeing. In addition, the despair of his character offstage and only someone with Coleman's depth can achieve the acting perceptions. It was like being Spenser Tracy as a dr. See Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, only that this dual role was much deeper and more moving. Shelly Winters looked so cute, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman valued his role in this film before anyone else he played, and in 1947 won the Oscar for Best Actor. I would watch this movie again and again and never get bored.
