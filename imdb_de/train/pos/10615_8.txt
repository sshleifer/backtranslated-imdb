The Unseen is designed in a style that is more like the old Hollywood mystery than a horror show. The movie is a bit slow, but many bizarre pictures keep it alive and looking good. The basic idea of ​​the young girls being stolen from the basement is old, but good acting and good production make the movie worth seeing. The film is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for explicit actions or special effects. I rated it with 8 out of 10 points.
