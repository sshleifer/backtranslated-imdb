Although Kurt Russell was and is the Elvis in show business, he is probably the closest person, but so many things were wrong in this film. At first, the makers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after a nine-year hault for movies by wearing a white jumpsuit from 1972. They also claimed that he sang "Burning Love," which he first sang in 1972, "The Miracle of thee," which he recorded for the first time in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all the Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know that all films based on the past have something wrong, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
