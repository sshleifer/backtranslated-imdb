The Man in the Moon is a warm and moving drama that revolves around a peasant family in the 1950s. The main story is about a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who eventually falls in love with his older sister (Emily Warfield) and an unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of the family forever. The fifties are lovingly addressed here and the script shows you characters that interest you almost immediately. Witherspoon already shows the Oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role, and London is a charming leader. Warfield gives the role of the older sister a quiet maturity that is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the girls' parents, and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. This calm and influential drama that arouses strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties" has moved me unexpectedly.
