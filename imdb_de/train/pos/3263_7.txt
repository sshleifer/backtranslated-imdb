I usually enjoy movies like "Chances Are", but for some reasons I was not happy with it. Overall, the first half was pretty good, Alex Finch died and was reborn in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his now-grown daughter. The scenes in which they meet again and rediscover Downey, who he once was, are well done, and if Shepherd finally believes that his husband is truly born again, there is a lot of emotion and happiness. There are several sex-related scenes that totally put me off, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to reunite despite their age difference. Thereafter, however, the film may end satisfactorily considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the movie to become so immoral in the end. There was a lot of potential in this story and the scenes in the sky are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the movie is not great. For a better, similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait." Decent, but I really wish I had not seen it because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
