As Otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of the highest quality. There are no loops and sequences where art loses quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not affect the enjoyment of the movie. Although described as "sappy", it should be noted that women do not react in the same way as men do. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily have to resort to "macho man" tactics to gain the respect of her peers. The Seiryuu for Noriko also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is as three-dimensional as a cartoon can look like. Her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems helpless at first, but ultimately succeeds by the power of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked like teddy bears. Even the gunbuster uses a rather dubious "homing laser" and "buster shield" (which is nothing other than letting the machine wrap a huge, velvety dracula-like cloak around itself). I doubt that scene should be funny, but she pulled me together. All in all, I would rank Gunbuster among the top 20 anime of all time.
