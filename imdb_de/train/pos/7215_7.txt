FULL OF SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty quick and entertaining thriller based on Ira Levin's drama, which features two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) planning the murder of a wealthy woman (Cannon), to get the property and the insurance. The plot succeeds, but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less well-established of the two writers decides to play the murder - with only minor changes in the details. Reeve allows Easthampton, Long Island, for example, to be screened in Southampton, Long Island. The rest of the drama is a dead giveaway, and to tell the truth, Reeve does not care about a little gossip or even an investigation into Cannon's seemingly random death. It will increase revenue and its own Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the playwright who has bombarded the last four productions and wants nothing more than quietly resuming his work, a new play, perhaps with Reeves Input, the would redeem his reputation. He can not let Reeve's scandalous game key be produced. What else? - He tries to murder him. In the end, they kill each other, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she earns a million dollars to sell to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for a reason. One is the production design. This multi-storey, multi-story home with the big windmill on top of nine of the world's most valuable acres (Easthampton!) Would be a great collection of digs. You can not afford a puppy tent in Easthamptom. The house is not too big or baroque in decor. It's just wonderfully modest, although it's a little tidier for my taste. The kind of house that is so clean that you are afraid to step on the thick carpet so as not to leave the footprint. <br /> <br /> Next The spectacle could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are great. Dyan Cannon does a perfect job when the worried woman, whose pants are as tight as if they were sprayed, which is okay given their assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role as a decent but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth was somehow difficult to define as a psychic neighbor Helga, a mistake. Granted, she - or someone like her - was necessary for the plot, but, my God, what an offensive cold is her character walking around, claiming "I feel pain in his Woom!" I think, to make her a little more interesting, she has sweat and a dumb-looking beanie with bike reflectors on it. Nevertheless, she is a nuisance from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You have to love Ira Levin's bitchy dialogue. The desperate Caine asks Reeve to tell him why he wrote the narrative. "Because it's there, Sidney!" Reeve says, and Caine shouts, "Those are MOUNTAINS, not GAMES! Games are not here until some hole writes them!" Caines call to the police after his wife is frightened as planned. He assembles into a sob of sobs that barely speaks as he reports the incident and begs to send an ambulance immediately. When he hangs up, his face takes on his usual, calm expression, blowing his nose into his handkerchief and leaving, all business again of artistry, lacking the evil charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes. The score consists mainly of light-hearted riffs of the harpsichord, which fit well in the film. <br /> <br /> You will probably enjoy it.
