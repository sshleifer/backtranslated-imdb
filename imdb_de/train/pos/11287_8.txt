As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the movie because it feels like a pretty accurate representation of the trading post. Also, the exhibition is necessary so we know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and frightening car chases ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group has to overtake a tribe of cannibals. The production values ​​before censorship add a lot of realism and show the terrible dangers that awaited the Europeans who went into the jungle. The film also offers, albeit perhaps prematurely, an accurate account of how dreadfully the native Africans were treated by their white employers. Sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, great sets and two chetas! Not to miss an adventure classic.
