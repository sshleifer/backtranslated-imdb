This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many are knocking on this movie? I will tell you. In this movie you have a black criminal outwitting a white professor. A black policeman who tells the white professor he's wrong to defend the black criminal, and the black cop turns out to be right. make the white professor look stupid. It's always about the race. This is an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can ignore the fact that in this movie characters are played by blacks who outwit the white characters, you should have no trouble enjoying this movie. I recommended everyone to watch this movie.
