The novel is slightly superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; For example, the quiet but grim humor that breaks into the scene with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession of the murdered child taking over part of the conspiracy. Where the film deviates from the novel, he tends to ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I do not want to point out that the movie is in any way bad. It always looks like a part and the story stays in the head like a good "Un". Some of the minor characters were stick actors who could turn their hand to anything. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
