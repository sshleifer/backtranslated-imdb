This prestigious Hollywood nomination is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizzazz and some delightful surprises. Among the funniest scenes are a funny shoot (and a re-shoot) of a World War I trench scene with the Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the luckless McDoakes as Boyer / Colman messenger. all under the beaded eye of Ralph Sanford's adorable irascible Anguish; a lost McDoakes, led and re-directed by Jack Carson; Assistant director Chandler was pleased with an opportunity sent by McDoakes: "I'm going to be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace-Comic O'Hanlon plays a double role and plays McDoakes as well as McDoakes himself! Strangely, Richard L. Bare, who plays himself in one or more other entries in the series, has denied this opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a younger, two-meter-long rock Hudson lookalike, but here he embodies the seasoned actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
