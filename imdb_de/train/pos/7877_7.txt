The writing <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar courageously and brilliantly "does" is the destruction of the myth inflicted on the glamor and glitterati supporters who paint the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (read partisan habits) we pursue with such maniacal zeal that only ours explain intrinsic voyeuristic trace. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is both regrettable and puzzling. How exactly it gained such control over the printed word and when it entered the front page is the subject of further debate. Bhandarkar avoids that cleverly. He only deals with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. He puts together the different elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (though I do not compare Bhandarkar with the genius of Altman), Bhandarkar uses a variety of characters to promote his motif. Whether it's a would-be NRI, the gate crashers, a new-rich, an aspiring model, a celebrity politician or an erotic short story writer. All characters are introduced with a target and each of them has their own character sketch, even if their parts can be tiny. And therein lies the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist covering page 3 for Nation Today. At first content with her work, she soon begins to recognize the ugliness of this lower abdomen, which is covered by its fake and cosmetic superiority. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make a movie out of this theme that tests morality and avoids focusing on a single character. Therefore, the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor, who passively accepts his role as the cog of a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialist stifling socialist. Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a gay makeup artist and Madhavis roommate Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the cheeky Air Force hostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems to be an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) in one story, but Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for creating a tight script. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, no matter how good, may be flat due to the lack of real performances. Luckily '' 'only bristles actors and no stars. Konkona effortlessly goes through her author-supported role. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost exaggerates it. Atul Kulkarni, however, is wasted with a signed character. Sometimes the director seems to be too eager to integrate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not hurry. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar tries to calm our voyeurism, but he goes one step further. He takes us into the photographs and shows us the cruel realities of this sect of humanity, which strangely seems to live in another and distant world. These are the same people who indulged in the hustle and bustle of the new year, while their compatriots were destroyed hundreds of miles from the ferocity of nature! Clever writing, skilfully rehearsed songs, capable performances and a sincere sense of sincerity make this film worthy despite the lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimal introduction to a new theatrical year. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Bad ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
