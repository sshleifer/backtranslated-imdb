This is an excellent movie about the characters in an adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions. It should have reached a wider distribution, as it is much better than comparable films from large studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is an almost Olympic human who is limited to giving basic lessons to adults, and often the target of hunting by his female students. He tries more or less to fend off them with different results. <br /> <br /> The student characters are mainstream USA. Teachers, policemen, students and retirees who for some reason did not learn to swim. The film treats their relationships, including their friends, relatives, and romantic conquests as they go through class. Several deals offer fun food, including a divorcee teacher, a few student documentary filmmakers, and a girl who is only in class to meet people. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie. Or just one, if you fancy a romantic drama with overtones of reality.
