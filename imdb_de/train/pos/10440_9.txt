This movie is smart. That is, it outperforms the lowest common denominator more than most other films - stupid people probably will not appreciate it. History is also heavily dependent on dialogue. There are some parallels to Lost in Translation, though Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply much better. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere are absolutely realistic. The actors are absolutely brilliant. Rarely have I seen a movie in which the screenplay and the acting blend perfectly together. <br /> <br /> The dialogue becomes very personal, with the danger of being a little over the top. However, it is almost always on the right side, although I found something awkward and embarrassing for a few moments. Balancing on this fine line requires outrageously talented actors. Sometimes it brings great results, and overall, this movie is just amazing! Only very, very seldom is "love" portrayed in films as I believe to be trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that the overwhelming and seemingly timeless beauty of the lead actress has helped quite a bit in this regard. She still looks stunning in this movie after 12 years. <br /> <br /> This is just a gem that you should not miss. One of the best movies I saw in the 1990s!
