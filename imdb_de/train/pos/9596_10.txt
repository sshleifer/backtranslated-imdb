This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching is inherently transformative for the viewer. Few films strive for this transcendence, and I can not imagine another film - documentary or drama - that achieves this. There's no other movie where I both laugh so much and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and barrier-free travel. it's a worthwhile endeavor, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about living every day you live. And it's a great, funny, adventurous tale. That's why God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
