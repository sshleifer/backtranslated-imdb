ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brazen lad of a struggling Irish family who was alive at the time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) claimed he could beat any man. "Both Flynn and Ward Bond are probably the best performers they've ever shown on screen Raoul Walsh has staged the colorful story with a robust style, capturing family life with warm scenes - hearty and full of humor - all Warner contract players including the ever-reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's wild father, who is proud of his son's martial arts, and ALEXIS SMITH, who best uses her role as a lively socialite who loves to tear down Flynn. A hook with cheeky one-liners who deals with his imaginary manners. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere of the 1880s is brought in B & W captured, though it's too bad that Warners no longer believed in Flynn to turn the film color. At that time he was in a rocky phase of his film career. He was involved in a well-known rape case where all the tabloids were busy fixing things up. The fight scenes are among the best ever choreographed on the screen, with Flynn obviously being in fine form and using very little of doubles for most of the action. And the scene in which Bond presents his award badge to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Perform interest, whether you are a sports fan or not.
