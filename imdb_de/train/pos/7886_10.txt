Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone here says that this is the worst! But it is not!!! Did not you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! That was the worst of all !!! Well, this movie is pretty decent and sticks to the Freddy story and it's cool he had a daughter and so on. <br /> <br /> And then I found out that it was in 3D !!! I was so excited, I remember, when I saw it on the DVD box set, I immediately jumped to the 3D sequences. Pretty much was in 3D, though Lisa Zane's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand and Freddy's head exploded. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3D, but I wish the whole movie was in 3D, not just the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes, NO TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
