Well, I had seen that "you all laughed" when it came out around <br /> <br /> in Europe in 1982 and kept a vague but kind memory to it. I've just seen it back on tape almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a decidedly warm tenderness about his characters and a friendly sympathy that's hard to feel. Excellent comedians and actors, everywhere good and good lines for everyone and also a good cut. I laughed and smiled the whole time. As we all do sometimes. Get it.
