The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Riddles are waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I think it's great that they are gradually revealing the stories about the characters! Just explain enough to stay excited! Of course, this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason will not appear in season three! Many of the characters have a decent kill, but some are just not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to you? Maybe they will come back in later episodes! But it is a bit inconsistent! Apart from that, "Lost" succeeds in inspiring every episode (especially the first two seasons)! That is a very difficult thing! I find that in the third season, the focus is more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the show! That's not a bad thing! It even spares some episodes of getting bored! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But at some point I want to see some secrets that need to be resolved, and get a closure! The risk that "Lost" will be canceled due to decreasing ratings is close! And that would be devastating!
