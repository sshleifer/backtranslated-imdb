A good movie with a time-intense, sprawling, rather dark story, reminiscent of John Ford's The Searchers, though not so brutal. The story starts quickly and does not fade, with several scenes of a really good dialogue between Jeff Stewart (Stewart), Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This movie is somewhat reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann Stewart work, but I found it far less sentimental and interesting. There are some reservations: a too quickly wrapped (and more sentimental) end; As a na√Øve French teenager, 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing, and of course the movie is set in the mythical West, a land of fable that does not respect the true laws of nations and physics. However, these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, withdrawn man who thinks he cares only for himself, and the mountain backdrop is unbeatable. A fine western costume drama.
