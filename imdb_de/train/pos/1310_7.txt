** SPOILER ** High-resolution police drama about a serial killer in and around the small town of Riverside Wisconsin. Who is being tracked down by local police, using police officer Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt, as a covert decoy to catch him? <br /> <br /> Nothing new in this TV-themed movie you have not yet seen, but the depth of the drama and script is unusually good, expressing not just the murderer but the policewoman as well Co-lover of a policeman, mental state. <br /> <br /> After shooting an armed and unstable assailant who had attacked her partner with a rifle. Officer Palusky's job is to approach homicide suspect Kayle Timler, Steven Webber. After being positively identified by the little girl Sahsa, Kim Kluznick, he saw him not far from the spot where little Timmy Curtis had been stabbed 18 times and stabbed to death the next day. <br /> <br /> Mr. "C" Diner where Tim works Gina gets very friendly with him and later tells him to make Tim open up that he may have been the serial killer she once was killed in an accident was a 79-year-old woman. <br /> <br /> Tim, who is said to have an ingenious IQ, does not seem to be trying to catch Gina's attempt to catch him, even though he later sees her in a bowling alley where her colleagues spend the night. When she plays a comical cat and mouse game with her Tim, Gina is hit by a knife at some point to admit that she is wired. But Gina tells him that the police forced her to take a break and release her from prison early. In addition to Tim's instability and criminal actions, we find that Gina is not everything. She seems to be suffering when she was rejected by her father, who left her with a drunken and abusive mother as a young girl who influenced her work as a covert policewoman. <br /> <br /> There's also the fact that Gina's beloved policewoman Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who has alienated himself from his wife and two children and is pursuing serial murder, is too over-cautious. This means that Gina almost blows her cover and she is later taken off her mission. <br /> <br /> From her boss Capt. Cheney (Dan Conway) has been placed undercover because of the objection of Officer McCaid after another boy, 12-year-old Davy Marish, was found murdered and Tim is admitting that he is the person to be responsible for the murder in the area. Gina does it with a hidden tape recorder that has replaced her with the one she gave him to show how honest she is, hidden on her. <br /> <br /> The film "In the Company of Darkness" was not really that extraordinary was the acting of Helen Hunt Jeff Fahey and especially Steven Webber. It was these high-profile ideas that led the film well beyond the average value of television film.
