I am quite surprised that so far no reviewer has commented on the rather elementary chess error in Luschin's game as a white opponent against a nameless opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a chess expert Luzhin can win the game with an illegal train. Between the fast sections and back to the board, it's not hard to see that after Lushin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his tower on d1 is still glued to the black tower of c1 against his king in the corner of h1. So he can not play the alleged mating move Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but he has shown that he does so under the enthusiastic applause of the audience.
