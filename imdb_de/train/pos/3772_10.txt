Bill and Ted's fraudulent journey is the best movie I've ever seen. Although the spectacle and the scenery, etc. are bad, who cares. The plot is brilliant and the jokes and words that bring them are excellent, the ideas are great as well. I recommend everyone to see this classic. The best part is obvious when they die 'melvin', I've gotten together for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is so much better than the first, which was great. Maybe the funniest movie ever !!!!! I think the best parts of the movie are, though, when Bill and Ted scream and play guitar solo, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen release a third movie !!
