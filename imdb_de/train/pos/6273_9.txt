I really loved this movie, yes, I know that it was quite far-fetched. It's not possible that Shelby Auto could stay on the road, as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other things, but otherwise the whole movie was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast was pretty good as well, except for the British bad guy, he was a little "too" a lot, do not you think? Anyway, great movie, great cars and great acting. I made sure my car was locked and alarmed that night in my remote-controlled garage. :)
