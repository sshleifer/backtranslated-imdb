Not a bad word about this movie. I was not impressed at first, but it was growing fast. I like it a lot, and I think it's a shame that many people can not see it banned in some areas, and mine was one of them. The film delivers in the department of shock, blood and atmosphere. The score is a beautiful device for delivering tension. It only seems fair that Chris Young was one of the best composers in the industry. The acting in this film is of a high quality, though in some places a little wood, and the effects are very real and bleak. All this is a big praise for a good Slasher movie in my book. In some reviews, I've found that the movie was seriously baffled with the recording of the killer's famous OO killer. And I ask: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? It is a classic shot that scares any good fan of the genre and keeps the identity of the murderer secret. The only thing that makes this movie not get top marks in my book is that the surprise (killer revealed) is not treated with more care. I mean, it happens somehow fast, although the good performances make it almost believable. Apart from that, PRANKS is a great movie (though I prefer the original title) and it's a pity that so many people shoot it down as a cheap piece of crap. It's more than that, but few know that it has apparently lost in the haze of the 80s of the Slasher. What a shame ... It's a really good movie, guys! You can believe me!
