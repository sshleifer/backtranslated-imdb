I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and when I saw that this was going on in the cinema, I could not help it. I wanted to see Allen doing his great movie Match Point, as this is another of his films that appeared in G.B. were filmed. (This is unique to Allen) and his new muse, Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is the most enjoyable aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (journalist), who gets a clue to a hot story from outside the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and has to decide if the truth is worth a search. Oh, and all this is done with the help of a limping, all-played detective. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I enjoyed Johanson's performance very much, but I'm a bit biased, I could watch three hours of filming with Johanson forever and stay enchanted. She plays a tiny, happy, limping treasure that is a kind of diversion in the sense of Allen's stereotypical, neurotic-infested character. It adds appropriate body language for the comic effect. Needless to say, almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character disgustingly cute, and that's a plus. Allen is Allen ... He still plays the same character as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that happens in this movie asks me if I'll see the neurotic little hypochondriac again. He is not in the cast of his next picture and is spending more time lately behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also pleasing as a polite, millionaire murder suspect. I can not say that Jackman is doing something special to make the role his role, but he still fits his character. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that this is fresh ... Actually, it stinks of the curse of Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything else. However, I have to applaud Allen for his end, because he is a little smarter than your typical Hollywood version of this movie. Instead of being black and white, things are painted in grayscale. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it, nor any obvious guilt. Although the plot seemed old, Woody still has a knack for a liner. I found his allusions to his last movie interesting ... Come for the humor, laugh and be funny. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you enjoy Allen's work, look at this. If not look something else ...
