At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says he was accused of two strikes against him: he's black and male. In addition, he has a third blow: he is gay. "You have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he is told. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are transvestites or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jennie Livingston treats an issue that could very easily have been a freak show, allowing people to express their humanity. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that it is tragic. Many of the people are seriously rejecting; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this movie of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, this movie is not for you. But if you watch this movie, you'll find that "Paris is Burning" is not really about men wearing women's clothes. It is a group of people who are routinely marginalized and generally depressed by society, a sense of community in their lives. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film four times since it was published in 1991 because it says so much: it is a commentary on materialism in our culture, on gender roles about rich and poor people, about the media and what she celebrates, over glory and worship. "Paris Burns" is one of the most humane and one of the saddest films I have ever seen.
