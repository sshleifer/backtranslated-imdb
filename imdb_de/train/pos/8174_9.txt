I love this movie. As a child, this was one of the first films that made me falter. Sure, it's mild now, but it used to be great. Dentists are one thing that many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I've always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays dr. Feinstone perfect, nobody could have done better. And for a low budget horror movie, the effects and the like are pretty good. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) also plays a curious cop and does a good job. There is a lot of blood and some really cool torture / death scenes. Check this out!
