MULHOLLAND DRIVE has made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and style have a magic that crosses the canvas. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was a surprise for me, with an easy-to-follow story and sunny sets. Even so, Lynch is there, and though this is far from his best, it's a movie you should not miss. Richard Farnsworth's late performance is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
