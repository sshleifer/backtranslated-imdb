A few years ago, the satellite channel U.K. Gold repeats of 'Men Behaving Badly' with the hype: "Here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!". That was actually wrong. 'Man About The House' was also a flat sitcom and ran from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Father Dear Father'. In the end, they decided to do something more in tune with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) clean up their apartment in Myddleton Terrace after a wild party when they find a man in their bathroom. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a cook student from Southampton without a permanent residence. As his clothes dry, he puts on a women's coat and prepares a meal for them. They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there can not be a bad business. So Robin has to act like she's gay ... <br /> <br /> On BBC-2 'I Love 1973', which was shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic (for me anyway) images of British television in the 1970s was Sally Thomsett, who came with a sunshade from the London Underground. <br /> <br /> A man who lived with two girls was a daring topic at the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts were as close to the edge as possible without crossing them. Richard O'Sullivan still played 'Bingham' in 'Doctor In Charge' by I. T. V. when this began. In fact, the second run of 'In Charge' overlapped the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sex-addicted Robin. Paula Wilcox 'Chrissy' was more Streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. Over time, he almost became like an older brother to her. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the fighting Ropers. George had lost the interest in sex, but Mildred did not. They went on to their own show - the matching "George & Mildred". The late Doug Fisher was a good value as Robin's wideboy friend Larry. He worked so well that he became a regular. Within a year of his debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. I'm not a big fan of the film "Man About The House" because I think it was stretched onto the big screen. Most of his characters had never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became the longtime "Three's Company," starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often wearing sexy clothes. After six seasons, House ended up with Chrissy, who married Robin's older brother Norman (Norman Eshley). The fans were devastated when they saw Robin could not find the girl he loved, but it was a bit of comfort that he also got his own show - "Robin's Nest".
