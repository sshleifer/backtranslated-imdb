Very good drama, though it seemed to have a few empty spaces, so that the audience can complete the action themselves. I can imagine life as someone who can neither read nor write. This movie simply clapped to the real world: the woman who is suddenly the only supporter, the living relatives and their quarrels, the disturbed child who is knocked down and then usually breaks off school, a donkey man who takes in the child's nest egg and buys it Beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
