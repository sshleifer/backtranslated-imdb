This is not a profound movie. Most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true," but they were good and made some interesting points about what we (our "mistakes" as the movie calls them) could repent when looking back on our lives , I had not read the book, so I did not know much about the story of a dying woman who has long had strong memories she shared with no one. Fortunately, they got a first-class cast ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer plays the young Purple, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie as the old Lila ... Apart from an amazing resemblance (duh !) the younger actress did a great job (maybe not quite in the caliber of her mother, but who is that?) Everyone else in the movie was alright, though I wished there had been more Glen Close and thought the Buddy Character is a bit too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more a girl's movie than a boys movie, but a good movie you can see with your mother or daughter and maybe start a dialogue. How hard is it really to know a parent as a "person"!
