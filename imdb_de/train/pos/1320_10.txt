In the early to mid-seventies, Clifford Irving suggested writing The Ultimate Biography of Howard Hughes, who allegedly spent months preparing for the book and was in interviews with the retired millionaire. When all this turned out to be wrong, Irving was accused of assault and spent several years in jail (though he had always admitted his findings were accurate). Just before 20001, a few months before September 11, a book titled "Forbidden Love" (published in the US as "Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern Jordan") by a previously unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri , a Jordanian woman, who spoke of the death of her best friend Dalia through mercy, as Dalia was from a devout Muslim background with a Christian. It was revealed as Irving's biography of Hughes as a possible joke. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski tries to dive into the swamp where Khouri's attempts to break free from the lie. During a 104-minute period, the film attempts to reveal that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive liar with her own agenda / vendetta? Interviewing those who know her (including a former husband, her publisher, and others) tell her story page. This is a toothy, well-produced documentary that allows many fingers to target as many potential culprits. Not rated, but pervasive in bad language and a reenactment of the gruesome murder scene played a couple of times (but nothing nearly as graphic and disturbing as what you would see in the latest torture porn epic like Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
