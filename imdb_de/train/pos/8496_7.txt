Wow, it's been years since I saw this movie for the last time. It is certainly something else to see it in 2008 than to see it in 1986. At first I did not think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of the Americans. If that was not bad enough, the picture became even worse after the best workers in the small American town were shown. In the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were presented as emotionless robot workaholics. The movie was not so funny, I just hung there because of the nostalgic value. And I am glad that I continued the clock. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, the judges influence how you finish the round. This movie ran from about three to seven, which I rated because of the end. The end was excellent. They always wanted a harmonious ending and that was exactly what it was. It was great that the city could keep its jobs and keep the factory, but the special was the connection between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended with a high note.
