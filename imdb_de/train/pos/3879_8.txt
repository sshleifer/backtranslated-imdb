A typical Clausen movie, but also not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. This is really a great movie about normal people who lead a normal life and try to make the most of it. The 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut convinced. They think he is really sick. Sonja Richter plays a nurse who's really an actor, but it turns out she's the best nurse looking after the old man. Everyone has problems and those nobody believes in will be happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their lives and their love.
