This is a very moving picture of about 40 best friends in a small town in England. With a younger piano teacher one finds a passionate love and a new beginning, When tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of handkerchiefs with you! A powerful job. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is picked up by her young, handsome piano teacher and a passionate romance blossom. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank that quickly leads to a tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one fell swoop. In the end, an unexpected surprise pulls them back together (in my opinion, their forgiveness is not justified)
