The movie is very realistic. It absolutely does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre, where every line has to be pronounced perfectly and every movement is precise. The actors, who play the roles of the lovers, do a great job representing the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their adventures in everyday life. Overall, the movie leads to a depressed state of the viewer. Here is the realism of the whole story. Not everything happens the way we think it should. However, I can say that the film does not end with a bad grade. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. That's probably the moral of this story.
