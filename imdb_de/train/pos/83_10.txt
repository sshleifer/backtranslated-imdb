Several years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on the TV series "The Real McCoys". I said then and repeat it now, it was a charming, funny and entertaining show that played well with wonderful characterizations. I have recently seen on DVD four old episodes PLUS, the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is strange that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not mentioned, but maybe they can be located via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The Reunion The show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. Insider information we did NOT get was whether Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the show in an uncomfortable contract dispute, which made Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a bomb with a comedy called "Broadside," which refers to female nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Got it? Broadside? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the sloppy, violent and violent TRASH on TV that undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" maintains decent values ​​and fine people. I thank everyone involved, including creator Irving Pinkus, for bringing them to my family. We never missed it.
