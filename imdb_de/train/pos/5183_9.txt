<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it during my studies in the early 1990s, and although I did not identify with the film in the thirties, I felt that the story, the characters, and the film were generally first-rate. For the people who have talked negatively about Indian Summer, you can happily stick to your overused Armageddon films and leave the films with a great, healthy story to those who appreciate them.
