One of my favorite movies of all time. Simply beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor and intelligence. The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also fantastic ..... a great selection of the best British talents. I loved them all for each and every element that was included in the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to make a story like this - everything about this movie works <br /> I love it :)
