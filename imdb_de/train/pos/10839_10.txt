I discovered this movie in the video library a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I loved it so much that we bought the VHS and since then we've enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The plot has been well discussed. The point is, this movie deserves repeated visits. In particular, Americans will not get all the jokes the first time. I know that I did not do it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. If Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, that is staggering. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" while trying to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it is too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: It's as good as any soundtrack I've heard in years. I danced in the living room to "Anywhere in the World". <br /> <br /> Every achievement is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightly complimented on his portrayal of Ray, a man who had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovely keyboarder who has worn a torch for Karen all these years. He has a responsive hangdog look that wants to make women embrace him. But all actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore all the pans you read about this movie and see it. It is a gem.
