Good movie. Tell a young fantasy story that tells us how caught we are in social situations and what extreme measures you have to take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: You must violate any rule, if you want to break a rule. If you want to express love to someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about fascism to decide about the cultural life of others, what kind of culture is being pushed down our necks. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what we decide? Can I not drink the morning coffee alone? Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, the dumb headlines of the tabloids and street advertising before we even drank our morning coffee?
