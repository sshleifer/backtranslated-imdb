How can a movie with the singing of Curtis Mayfield be bad? It can not! The Groove Tube is a series of skatological dimming sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The heights (Koko the Clown, the simple glide recipe) surpass the lows (too long "The Dealers"), but even the lows are funny. Best of all, Ken Shapiro's manic dance on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan (this is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole who sings Just You, Just Me). Definitely outdated, but by that time The Groove Tube was disrespectful, brave, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this little cult hit, then he made the opening bomb "Modern Problems" (although I enjoyed it) 7 years later, and on Christmas day, and unfortunately nothing since then. (He could possibly play drums in a jazz group) The Groove Tube For me, there is an infinite impulse of positive energy, a film that still gives me great pleasure 26 years after my first visit!
