This documentary is about a story that was covered in Pilger's last book, Freedom Next Freedom, which was published in 2006. It shows the shocking expulsion of the natives from Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br The Islanders are technically British citizens, since Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island where the natives were banished. However, the British government has ignored their request to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the US Army, which has used it as the basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <Br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking as it documents the treatment and current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews in all areas are excellent, and his cornering with a member of parliament using his own information from the government is among the best of its kind. Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently published documents fully illuminate the British conspiracy to expel the natives. The weaving of this footage with the interviews and the music of the islanders really increases the effect of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to look at, but "Stealing a Nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
