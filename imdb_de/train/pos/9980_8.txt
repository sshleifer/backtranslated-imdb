Any movie that shows that PIGs (Persons in Government) are the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scriptwriting and editing and even sometimes the directors are flawed, so there will be people who disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original path when it was new and I hated it, despised it, loathed it, loathed it. I thought it was a terrible, irrational junk. Now I do not remember why. I think they should not be compared. <br /> <br /> Think of them as two different films. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" offers a gathering place, a banner for people who want to promote individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom, and above all the government Be federal government. <br /> <br /> "The Voice" wears a New Hampshire themed cap: "Live free or die." At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans. Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie to cheer.
