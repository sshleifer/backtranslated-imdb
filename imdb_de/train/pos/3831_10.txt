This is a free adaptation of the novels by Clarence Mulford; Fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a bit at sea here (and the reviews here reflect this so far). But I first knew Hopalong from the novels and never cared for the Boyd movies when I came to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise decision - he did not do a nostalgic "Western". ; Instead, he's gotten used to the Cassidy story as a piece of what we used to call "Americana." or what older critics once called "homespun". As the movie was being decoded, I increasingly remembered the great "Hallmark Theater" version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It" with James Garner. Both movies remind us, though films about the "Old West" are probably always mythical to Americans, they do not have to be "westerns"; You can very well be just films about what it meant to be American in this place. <br /> <br /> I never feel excited when watching this movie. There's no trouble pushing the Boyd Cassidy heir in our throat, no irony, no camp. So I have the feeling that these characters were walking through a real West America - or even ridden - I too could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Given the simplicity of the film - it positively avoids what we call "style" - everything is in its favor; and the simple actions of the interpreters fit in perfectly with this; Gosh, it really feels like a story told around a campfire on a cattle ride - no visual suits, just the quirks and the good mood - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good story of an adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer sets revealed expectations aside, he or she will enjoy it considerably. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie 9 stars, but I'll do it Enter a ten just because most reviewers have missed the point completely. and I urge her to put her memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: A reviewer complains that Hopalong shoots people in this film instead of firing their weapons (ala Boyd's Cassidy); First, Cassidy shoots people in the novels; Second, if Cassidy was a real cowboy, he would have shot people - the problem with the rifles from the hands of humans is that they can always get another weapon - which happens to be part of the subtext of this movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have the director of "The Godfather" under their belt, who gives them every opportunity to make films that I do can not do. but a good movie is a good movie; and that's a good movie. If it's from someone named "Coppola," it's just the way it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was it until Bush took office) - that's what the big American novels are all about.
