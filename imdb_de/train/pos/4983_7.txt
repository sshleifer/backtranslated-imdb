A short topic from SHIRLEY TEMPLE. <br /> <br /> At Buttermilk Pete's Cafe, the local wind-robed WAR BABIES can get into the milk at lunchtime. <br /> <br /> This primitive little movie - a parody of military films - offers a few giggles, but nothing else: Tiny little things that talk hard can weaken in no time. Shirley Temple, who plays a double, hip-swinging French miss, has little to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlight: the real sign of a toddler temperament when some of the babies are soaked in milk unexpectedly well. <br /> <br /> Today, often overlooked or neglected, the one-and-two-role briefs for the studios were useful as an important training ground for new or budding talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics with which a succesful short motive was created was completely different from a full length movie. This was more like a short story than a novel. Economical in terms of budget and schedule and able to present a wide range of materials, short topics were the perfect complement to the feature films of the studios.
