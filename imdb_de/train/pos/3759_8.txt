Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are close to rock stars in the near future but need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted will be in popular public history, but then a bad man (Joss Ackland) will kill Bill & Ted by sending cyborg looks to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent into the past and they murder the real Bill & Ted. Well, both guys are ghosts and have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. Much funnier and more entertaining than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> DVD has a good anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer and fine Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD has the movie trailer and an amusing backdrop behind the scenes. This sequel was a box office hit like the original, but it's also one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin briefly repeats his role from the original. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a funny fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
