A powerful adaptation of the bestselling book and the overwhelming Broadway play about the life of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters over 100 years old. They played wonderfully by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll in old age, telling their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. The retrospective and the current scenes do not have as much inspirational value as in the book, but are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the life of the sisters, such as the racial background of their mother and the reasons for their father's stern personality, are not clearly illustrated. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. That's a good thing, because the book is just as great! Apart from these shortcomings, it has been wonderfully done and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and instructive film.
