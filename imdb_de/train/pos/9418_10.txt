I had been on tape for years and watched it again this morning (while I waited for my lingerie - how ironic!), Mainly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's theme music again. In the end I sat for about half an hour, fascinated by how wonderful the direction, the writing and the performances are secured. The film is like a Who's Who of the British Characters of the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and especially Ernest Thesiger. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not character players as such, but charming, charismatic leaders. This is science fiction in its purest form and also a funny comedy. An eternal classic, and I hope nobody is trying to make it new!
