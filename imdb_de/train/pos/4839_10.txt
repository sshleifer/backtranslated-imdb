A timeless classic that plays wonderfully with perfect location settings and conjures up a wonderful atmospheric movie. a simple story, mixed with humor and excitement. I wish a video would be available in the UK. I have seen this movie many times and it is next to Oh Mr. Porter one of my favorites.
