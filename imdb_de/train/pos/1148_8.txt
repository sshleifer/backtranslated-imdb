This is one of those films - like Dave, American Dreamer, and Local Hero - that always arouse a viewer's interest. Light films seldom win Oscars, but anyone who did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after watching the movie and knowing what's coming, it's still gratifying to see how the various facets of the plot evolve. It's true, the whole drama is melodrama. but this is quite suitable for a film with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can not I write something like that?" I find it regrettable that the TV and website censors insist on all these unnecessary sanitation.
