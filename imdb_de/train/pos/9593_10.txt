First of all, I am a pure white man. But even with this handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80s. I had many gay friends who grew up in New York in the eighties, and the only thing I admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted. No matter what the consequences are. That's brave. You have to admire that. This is a great movie, watch the movie and see what it was like to be an extravagant African American or Hispanic gay man in New York in the 1980s. It is real life. The bottom line is the real life.
