The good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of the little things in life that could greatly affect someone else's life without you ever knowing. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> The Bad Thing: There are too many characters and it's hard to say who the main character is, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <It's a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia, which I have not seen yet. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would rate it as PG -13 for brief violence, some language and sexual situations.
