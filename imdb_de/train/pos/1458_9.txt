Sharp, well-made documentary with a focus on carnival beads. I have always liked this approach to filming - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex and often obscure phenomenon by breaking the problem down into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people have heard stories about sweatshirts and the basic motives for profit and capitalism, and the implications of globalism for poorer countries (however people think about it). Instead of dealing with these issues and putting oneself on a soapbox (except that there is something wrong here, except for those documentaries that normally preach to the converts), this documentary simply shows carnival beads, how they are made, what people and what is underneath which conditions and how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. It is open and keen to investigate the motivations of all those involved in the process, including the workers, factory management, American importers and, ultimately, the consumer at the bottom of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little bit ill; This also applies to the Mardi Gras celebrants, but also to the way in which the workers in China have considered their situation to be normal and self-evident (even if they object to the details of their administration). A special impression was made by the images of the street sweepers who cleaned the pearls off the streets in the end. But that was just my reaction. I can see someone else reading this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentary films on the subject, I do not believe that you need to have a certain political opinion to be affected. This is ultimately a story about man and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product manufactured in the Far East, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> Excellent and highly recommended. You have to see more documentation like this. Kudos to all who participated in this film.
