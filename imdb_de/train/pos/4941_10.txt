I think many people did not rate the movie, NOT because of the lack of quality. However, it did not follow the usual Hollywood formula. Some conflicts are not resolved. The end is just a bit too real for others, but the journey offered by the rich characters and long list of supporters is both thoughtful and entertaining. Although the cinematography is excellent given the urban environment, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book. They took some risks and did a few things differently. I think it worked well, I purposely try to avoid direct references to the film, because the best answer is to look at it for yourself because it does not accept the interpretation of another.
