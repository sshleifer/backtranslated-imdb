In this episode, a lot is outdated (just like most Twilight Zone episodes), such as the woman's unbelievably sexist military uniform. And some things are so incredible, such as the availability of clean water. Still think of the year in which this was done, and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is so special. It has a nice hope that something is missing in many Twilight Zones as well as an interesting female character (though she rarely speaks), something different in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone could take on more than 20 minutes of more emotion and drama than most of today's two-hour films. And it's great to see two people who became American icons so early in their careers.
