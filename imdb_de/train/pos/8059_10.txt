I saw this movie last night on Turner Classic Movies and was thrilled with the performance of Victor McLaglen: in the truest sense of the word a "tour de force". The atmosphere of Dublin in 1922 was brought to the forefront by cinematography and production design, which emphasized the techniques of the best film noirs of the 1940s and early 1950s, Gaelic. The score of Max Steiner is unforgettable. As in later films such as the 1939 GWTW, he used folk ballads to give local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: Already in 1935 a movie giant!
