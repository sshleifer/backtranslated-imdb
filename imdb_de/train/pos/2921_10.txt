The only thing was a great movie. I just finished EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought that this is a good portrayal of life as a professional wrestler. Now this movie was shot 4 years before my birth, but I do not think that the rigors of professional wrestling travel have changed so much. Sad, funny and all around GREAT !!! **** 10+
