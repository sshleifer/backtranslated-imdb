Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who has lost his muse. He has been faking it for some time and buys his lyrics and music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) happen to coincide and fall in love. And then they discover what they have done. Complications follow, but in the end everything is right. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing terrific. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and doubled as a regular at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I did not understand, the movie audience did not take her with me, so in 1944 she went back to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus. There she stayed. Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy very well. His ego is constantly being emptied by Sidekick Oscar Levant, and I'm surprised they did not do more movies together. <br /> <br /> As in most Crosby Paramount cars, no big production figures, but I agree with the previous reviewer of the theme tune as a spontaneous jam session in a pawn shop. Good job for everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
