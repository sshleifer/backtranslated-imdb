I see that some people today do not see a movie without a filming style. So much dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, have changed what we expect in a movie, maybe Casomai is not a loner -american movie anymore, the film needs all the film resources and language to tell us a simple story about love and marriage but much more. Full views, lectures and let's think ... and I'm sure you can not crash every second of a long 116 minutes. I expect that there is not a single scene more than 3 or 2 1/2 minutes.
