Warning! Spoiler ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I saw a movie in German, so it could be that I missed some hints. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness In the storyline, it's a movie that got through to me. I particularly liked the acting of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I get the impression that she is Camille. But I can not stop wondering what happened to Bob, Cassie and Baby in the end. I believe that after she was initially put on Bob, she finally loved him and regretted what happened to his brother and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like such ends. Dean Cain was better than ever, Eric Roberts. Well, I have seen him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film is more of an analysis of human relationships and a crime story reacts in unexpected situations. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, I really liked it.
