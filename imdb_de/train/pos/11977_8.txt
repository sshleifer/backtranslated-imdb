OK. Who brought the cheese? I love it. During the race it became a phenomenon. The anorexic twins became popular. Bob Saget started to paycheck (instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. That was when life was good and easy. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always brought a good lesson home. And here I am different from the norm: I liked the last seasons. As with Home Improvement, the script can do much more as children get older. That's why I dare say ... It could have been much later than it did. But anyway. I gave him an 8/10 because of his healthy, funny stories and because of Bob Saget!
