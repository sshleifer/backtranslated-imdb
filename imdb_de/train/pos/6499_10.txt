After all these years, I still regard this series as the best example of WWII documentary film production. The interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from all other projects. It would be great if a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) Picked up on this topic and tried to collect information from veterans before they all disappeared. With modern technology for improving old archive material and a wealth of information discovered since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The History Channel has made some nice shows that deal with many aspects of World War II, but an extensive series such as "World At War" has not been successfully tried since the original. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. It requires a consideration.
