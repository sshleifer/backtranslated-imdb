This is not a criticism of the film, but rather a commentary on how blind we are to our own past. <br /> <br /> Recently, I've seen Winter Soldier and The Ground Truth looked as if I would see a remake or a sequel - unless it came to Iraq, not Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of their one-sided message, show both films, as we jump happily on conflicts that are based on false pretenses, and our young and brave (and often naive) allow to bear the brunt of this greedy war profits. Both films effectively show that the mentality that has put young and willing people in the head makes them efficient killing machines, but training is not enough to convey the diplomatic and police skills necessary to the hearts and minds to win the spirit of the people who they are supposed to win fighting for. This has ultimately lost the war in Vietnam and is likely to lose the war in Iraq. is <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it could be easily passed as a left propaganda. Not from me, mind you, but from those who want to discredit the film and the news. A more balanced viewpoint would appeal to a larger audience.
