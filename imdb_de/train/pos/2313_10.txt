This "Coming of the Age" movie is about the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, who are getting to know life and love a fateful summer "To Kill a Mockingbird", the movie never hits the wrong mark. The spectacle is great. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes an impressive movie debut. When I saw this beautifully photographed and excellently staged and edited film, I felt like looking through a window to reality instead of watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say that this is one of the best films ever made to be young, to be in love and to have feelings, challenges and changes to go through the young adulthood. Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 should consider it together and use it as a contribution to the discussion, as it raises a number of questions about sibling rivalry, how to deal with infatuation, parent responsibility, and so on.
