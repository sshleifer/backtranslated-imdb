Enjoyed this 1936 film with many seasoned classical actors and most notably William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane", divorced and still managed to live and fight with each other. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a murder case and did everything to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a pretty nutty type and there's a lot of comedy from 1936, and the murder method is something you'll never believe, especially with a jockey on a California racetrack. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" had a great supporting role as a bookmaker with James Gleason, a detective who helped Dr. Bradford needs to solve this very strange murder mystery. When you watch this movie, just remember that it was produced and staged in 1936. The viewers at the time thought that this is a great conversation and really in Those DAYS!
