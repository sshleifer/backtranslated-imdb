This second movie is as interesting as the previous one except that there is no tension. We know what he will do and what will happen before it is indicated on the screen. Then the joy comes only from the way the various tricks are done, and the consequence of it. We know that there will be dynamism in the car, that he loses a bike, that the car has an accident just to talk about the car. And that's exactly what happens. Now the details and details are for you to discover in the movie. That he's being lured by a dumb woman is obvious and must come, but we know he's already seen through it and he knows he's being trapped. Well, how will he get out of this? You have to discover this yourself. And do not worry that he gets the main traffic, but what's another story. A speedboat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he is wounded. They did not know what bulletproof jackets were then. It is true that it was recently discovered that some GIs in Iraq did not have such devices. But what does such a movie mean? This insistence on the hunt for traffickers and this blindness, which does not realize that the ban is causing the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect example of the lack of value that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why do not you just legalize these goods so they can be properly monitored and monitored? If something is not illegal or is removed, it is all the less fun to use and do it. It is the forbidden or the limited that is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
