Have just watched this movie, which has me very excited. Also twice in South Africa, at the time this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a big hit, and the opening scenes tend to "set the scene". The slow, but steady increase in tempo hardly allows a break, and there are certainly few light moments. <br /> <br /> Nigel Hawthorne will never be able to see that again. He looked like a twisted person, and I turned him off every time he showed up. <br /> <br /> Fully in line with Steve Thomp's articulate and thoughtful comments.
