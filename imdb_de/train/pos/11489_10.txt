If you're looking for a Hollywood action kid movie with the usual bad language and violence, this may not be the movie. On the other hand, if you are interested in seeing a movie with your children that actually has some values, such as showing the importance of friendship and truth, this is the movie you should watch. If you look at the program guide, it's obvious what millions of other viewers have found. Not many low-budget independent films were aired as many times as Mr. Atlas. The film is actually very funny and warm and shows some beautiful locations that are masterfully captured by the keen eye of the obviously brilliant cinematographer Suki Medencevic. Even if you are looking for a muscular man with good looks, the ladies can get an eye full. Let us support those who make good children's films by buying their videos and watching their products on television. Enjoy
