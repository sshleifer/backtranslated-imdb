The Plainsman is an entertaining Western, undoubtedly a classic that is still relevant today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, perfect for the role. Together with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors to play western heroes of their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, nobody I know played better than she did. Even though historically it is not accurate, the film manages to capture the most important things about Hickok and the time in which it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice the story to say something, and that's what DeMille does here. The friendship of Hickok with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a major manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have by the end of the Civil War, Custer and Little Big Horn, the troubled relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife a religious one Woman, with Hickok a man who had killed a lot, even the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity makes "The Plainsman" an unconventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short performance that already shows what a great actor he should become. Much care has been taken to show the original weapons of the time.
