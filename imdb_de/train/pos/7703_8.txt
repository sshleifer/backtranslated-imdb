I was surprised how a movie can be cheesy and excellent at the same time. The frisbee flying saucer was incomprehensible, especially at the landing, but the particular impact of attacking the Krell was fantastic for a movie filmed over half a century ago! When I lived in the Middle East, I saw Islam invade when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress more modestly. As an engineer, he was amazed at the imagination of the "futuristic" gadgets and the props developed by the prop department. All in all a fun hour and a half hours. For the first time, I saw Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man
