Carla works for a developer, where she is unattractive, unrecognized and desperate. She is deaf, too. <br /> <br /> Your boss offers to hire someone to reduce their heavy workload, and takes the opportunity to secure a male company. Help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed Hoodlum who is fresh out of jail and apparently not fit for the routine routine of an office environment. An implicit sexual tension develops between the two and Carla is determined to hold on to it, despite his aversion to the work week. When Carla is ousted from an important deal she negotiated with a slimy colleague, she exploits Paul's criminality by letting him steal the contract. The colleague soon realizes that she is behind the robbery, but when he confronts them, Paul's willingness to slap people in the face is also useful - but this brawl costs a price. <br /> <br /> Paul is left by some mob acquaintances as a reminder of unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique lip-reading skills to tear a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it is Carla's turn to enter a terrifying new world. <br /> <br /> The fourth contribution by director Jacques Audiard, "READ MY LIPS", begins with a sweeping romantic drama between two marginalized losers, a nervous thriller in which their symbiotic shortcomings make them winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is a pleasing farce in which she tries to avoid his grudging restraint and captivity to discover that until recently he was a prison bird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has the almost exclusive ability to move from the Dowdy to the Magnificent and back again within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems to be at home when he gets a flogging or the rip-off that will likely kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French films, 'READ MY LIPS' does not seem to be anything special at first, until you scratch the surface and find out that it's probably all about it. The only clue is a signature regarding the missing wife of Paul's probation officer. A device that is only meant to steer the main thrust of history into a small, dead-end street. <br /> <br /> It was the French "New Wave" of the 60s that introduced the concept for the first time. I always have the feeling that every medium is a little at risk if you have to use a label system to define it , Therefore, it is always a pleasure to discover a movie that seems to transcend the genre, or even better to oppose it.
