Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I just cried. The role of Ruth Close as Ruth showed that she wanted to deal with the situation, but she was under the rule of her husband. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character Joe calmly. The story portrayed a rural family involved in the accidental death of a son of his brother, The Stone Boy, which meant he was so desperate and overwhelmed with what he was doing, emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end, when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, all went out to a stranger, I was so broken for him that I actually thought of some of the horrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Young have NOT added much to the movie. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, happy brother Andy as an idiot who did nothing to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Young, looked like a crazy lady who, out of frustration, smacked Arnold with her own problems without pity and blamed him for her troubles. I could not really regret these two. Although Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both have NOT effectively dealt with their problems. They really did NOTHING for the movie and they were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's subordinate role as a grandfather was touching, for he was the only character who paid Arnold any attention. I felt that his role should be worked out. The players just did what they thought was appropriate and sufficient. The end, however, I liked so much that I actually laughed and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were again a family. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
