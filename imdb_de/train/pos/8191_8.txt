The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together make up the two best episodes of the "new" Doctor Who second season. However, it should be clear that much of the story translates the conspiracy of Quatermass and the Pit (1967) into a space setting, with the story of the universe entangled with that of the 666 animal. The relationship between Rose and the Doctor underscores, however Rose's growing self-esteem and establishing her as a not-quite-equal but still-existing partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is Matt Jones' elegant script, which occasionally reduces dependency on singles for the doctor and the performance of the entire cast, in particular the excellent Shaun Park, as Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
