I saw this movie when I was little. His name was "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized! This is followed by a cute little fox family. The beginning was great and I remember being very attached to the little foxes. I also remember my mother, who hysterically removed me from the theater. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say it does not end well for all foxes. I was used to Disney-type wildlife movies that DO NOT REALLY die. Oh man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think I was really small and the truth was told. Rent it if you can, but do not show your kids!
