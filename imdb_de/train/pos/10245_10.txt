This was a personal favorite of mine when I was young, it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies ... adorable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain and some great songs (and not the typical little mermaid / Beauty and the beast-like songs, but those that are entertaining)! I recently came across this movie again and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie, and I definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations! Sorry, not the most informative, I'm in a bit of a hurry ... please trust me. Everyone who opposes this movie is killing their inner child!
