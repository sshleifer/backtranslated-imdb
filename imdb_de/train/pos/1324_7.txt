You sit there for half an hour and look at a story, believe it all, then see another half hour of the same story, completely untangled ... and then put together again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie" except Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans". It shows, reveals, defends, reveals and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost", the celebrated and paralyzed bestseller of 2001 on honor killings in Jordan. The film is so extraordinary that this "exposure" of Khouri with full participation of Khouri is made. <br /> <br /> For the first part of the film, Khouri presents her story about the alleged honor killing of one of her Amman friends, the story of the book. It sounds absolutely believable and confident. <br /> <br /> Then their story is taken apart and taken apart by extremely credible and persuasive people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia where Khouri lived. A while. <br /> <br /> Khouri comes back and denies the allegations, doing a successful polygraph test. There is another devastating segment - not to mention here as this would reduce the shock ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential in the matter of the book) /> <br /> And The Houdini Act continues, round after round in this heavy, bouncing price war, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of a solution. Brilliant.
