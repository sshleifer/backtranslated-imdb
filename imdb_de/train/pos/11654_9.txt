I agree with the comment above, I love the realism in it, and in many movies (not just eating disorders films) producers seem to forget that. They take on an everyday problem and create a dramatically dramatic scene. At the end of the film, everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it's not the reality. It does not mean that things can not get better, and it does not mean that things do not stand in this movie, but it does not stop at most of the movie to create all those issues and is at the end of the movie everything perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people do not just admit it and want to get better, and then life is boring, it takes time and I like how we grow in this movie with the characters, we go through the difficulties with them and get better and worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. It puts people with eating disorders in their heads and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way, and I loved it. I love it too, as it turns out. The secrecy and betrayal of people suffering from eating disorders is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they agree. I found this movie very touching and beautiful and well told and defiantly one of my favorites.
