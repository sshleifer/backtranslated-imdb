One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were in the supermarket on Hollywood Boulevard. and La Brea, my dad and I, and guess who's in the corridor! Barney Phillips, but no hat - at least I do not think he had a hat. We asked him about his third eye, and he said something as if he had left it at home, and everyone he met that day had asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. Back then, we saw all sorts of character actors in LA. By the way, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to get past the "three hands" of the other alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood resident and resident from 1947 to 1963.
