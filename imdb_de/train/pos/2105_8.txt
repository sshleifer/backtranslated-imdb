In World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious shop assistant who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to find that the mysterious woman is none other than the shop assistant from his shop, who is constantly involved seems to be arguing with his colleague. Add a small twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stewart - is having an affair with the owner's wife), which briefly "fires" Stewart, along with a concession that the shop assistant Stewart is happy all the time was the end is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although very outdated (evidence of poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider), are overused, along with the hint that many small amusement objects look like a musical cigar box are unattainable for ordinary People), this movie is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s "You've Got Mail". In the replay with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual chances of the chain of events are so incredible that the intelligence of the viewer is grossly offended. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent Walk the memory down to a less complicated, less hectic and romantic time and a place known as a novelist's utopia. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture!
