This movie is as unique as it is overlooked. Another story is just that, it shows how, for survival or maintenance needs, you can find the ability to love when you have an open heart, an open mind. I saw this on cable for the first time in the late 1970s, and it really showed the limitations of the gay community at that time. I think this movie was ahead of its time when it was a small piece of an obscure way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it is a precursor to what is now presented as an extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS, so that not only the exceptional achievements of Meg Foster & Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still have to go when it comes to relationships.
