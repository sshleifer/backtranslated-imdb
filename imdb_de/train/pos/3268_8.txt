A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried three times to sum it up and can not. Suffice it to say that it is worth seeing. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in great shape and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine, but alright. If you're a good fan of good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), get them here. Downey also looks great in underwear! <br /> <br /> Extra Bonuses - the title track by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" by Cher and Peter Cetera.
