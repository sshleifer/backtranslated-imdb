"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's movie by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it may be a bit too dark and frightening for younger people. However, older children can eat it up, that is, if you play it synchronized in English. <br /> <br /> The story is about a little boy who moved to the country with his mother to live with his grandfather after a divorce. During a village feast, the boy is selected as a "Kirin driver", a great honor, but of course this honor also involves a lot of danger and adventure. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, doing evil acts as a woman In a white miniskirt, go-go boots, and a hive hairstyle, you can band together with a wicked yokai to counter people's resentment and discarded objects against them put. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster heading for the City of Fury, Tokyo. In a rather funny scene, two fianc√©s watch as they fly the monster over the city ... saying, "Oh, it's just Gamera." <br /> <br /> The young boy has become friends with Yokai, monsters of a kind, mostly benign, who have isolated themselves from humans, and all the yokai in Japan are gathering to fight evil /> In many ways, Miike & Crew have turned the Yokai movies of the late 60s / early 70s into a modern action adventure movie for (older) kids, which also brings together some weird mechanical monsters that make me think of Transformers left. The look and feel of the movie is great, the effects are entertaining and part of the humor will glide right over the kids' heads, but older ones can still enjoy it. For adults there is not much to like here. If you're a fan of Japanese monster movies, you'll enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Cool and funny stuff, sometimes dark But maybe that's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
