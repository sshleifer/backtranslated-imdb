If you want to limit your vision of Chaplin to a lovable cheater and make your belly laugh out of pathos, then look at something else. However, if you love a slapstick comedy that is performed by one of the best, then check this out. <br /> <br /> The picture is of the vagabond who really can not get the girl. He discovers another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has a great time ruining their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies" filmed in the park by Mack Sennett with pickpockets, police and couples. These short films work because the format allows Chaplin to shine while going through difficult situations. <br /> <br /> I have ticked the box, as this can be considered a spoiler even though you have not seen these films. All except Chaplin land in the pond. He gets the girl who in this case from Minta Durfee a.k.a. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle was played.
