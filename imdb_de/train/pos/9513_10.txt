A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes directed this beautiful movie, which shows another father-son camaraderie. Brilliant star cast with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) has done a great job by actors from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Casting is just too good. The plot is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. A great illustration of the gangster of the 1930s. In the 1930s, this will certainly stand out as the zenith of all gangster films from this period. Soundtrack is pretty good for the movie. A great movie that shows everything a father does to protect his son. Underestimated for my taste.
