This show is great. I thought that the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad. I actually cried. But the other shows were great. Kerry was my favorite character because she was on the "dark side". I also think that Bridget is funny because she is very naughty. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was really cute. I loved it when Kerry sarcastically commented everything. The guy who played Rory was cute and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. The entire TV show is funny and I wish they still showed it on TV. But when they showed it on TV, I saw it every time it went. The next time I see it, I'll see it over and over.
