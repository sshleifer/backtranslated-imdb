Some of my favorite films by Laurel and Hardy have very, very little action. Instead, they give them a more secular situation and just let them be weird! Films like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are some of the funniest if you see the boys working or cleaning. Here in DIRTY WORK, the movie is mostly similar to these two other films - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps, and spend most of the movie cleaning (rather unsuccessfully) a mad professor's fireplace. To see Ollie falling through the chimney, the boys make the house a total mess, and Stanley's insane behaviors all work together to make a very enjoyable movie, really weird subplot that starts and ends the movie. It seems that the professor is really a crazy scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. Later in the movie you can see him turn a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! Is it any surprise what happens when he leaves the boys alone in the room? Although this subdivision was unnecessary, it worked well. What worked exceptionally well was the middle section. Do not give the boys anything exciting and you will be amazed by the funny results. One of the better films of the team and earns almost a 9.
