This is a feel-good movie and nothing more. And that's a lot of fun to watch. Sure, it's flooding political issues. So what? I'm sure she did not try to make "good night and good luck" here. Let's not try to do anything other than what it is ... light fare. <br /> <br /> And very enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Do we remember what 1984 was like? We have become very sophisticated in the media, what we see or not. I tend to differ on this point. Goldie knew that was fun, and she kept going and did it. <br /> <br /> Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, House Sitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, seems to be playing badly like old times, becoming Death to her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... she plays every role in the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie knows just fine and knows what she's really good at. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh happily and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and in everything she's ever been to. She has never tried to be anything other than who she is ... and this is the bubbly, chubby girl next door, who is very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always love me and remind me that Life is quite short and you only have to relieve yourself, because before you know it, you are old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable sufferings of life. If it even comes so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovely, funny actress.
