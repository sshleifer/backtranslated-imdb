The only other review of this movie at the time really ruins the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of ​​what I can expect from a movie I do not know much about. It is unfortunate if there are not many comments for a particular tile, because if there is only one review and the film and cast are inappropriately wasted, you will have no idea what to expect. I read the review before I saw this title, and I do not know where all the poison for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive folks who usually delivered, though the material was not the best. I found the movie and the performances funny and enjoyable. It is not one of the great classics of all time, but a pleasant and fun variety - much more than you can hope for in most recent films. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
