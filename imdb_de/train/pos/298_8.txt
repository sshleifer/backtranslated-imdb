New York has never looked so good! And nobody has anyone in this movie. The script is a bit lightweight, but you can just like this movie or one of the characters in it. They almost wish that such people really existed. The thrill of the actors is what really impresses them (John Ritter, Colleen Camp, and the late Dorothy Stratten are especially good.) If you rent or buy this movie, you'll be glad.
