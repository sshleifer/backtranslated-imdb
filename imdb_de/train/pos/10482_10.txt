I love this movie. It is one of those that I can see again and again. A good cast that does not try too hard to be star-studded behaved well. <br /> <br /> The premise of a freshly widowed housewife selling heads could become a goodwill Americanized crap on a movie or an action thriller. Either the movie would have killed completely. <br /> <br /> The film is like an Ealing comedy, which is characterized by a great feel-good factor throughout. <br /> <br /> It's worth it for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cereal ... (no, that's not a spoiler!)
