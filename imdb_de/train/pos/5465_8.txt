This is a hardened Warner Brothers movie starring the very young Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck, a master of Machiavellian cool art, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, plays Lily Powers, the worn-out daughter of a violent spokesman in a stifling steel town. She was made cynical and deaf when she was offered to her father's clients as a sexual favor. As soon as her father dies in a distillery explosion, she jumps to New York on a freight train and literally sleeps up the bank ladder. <br /> <br /> This would seem absurd if Stanwyck would not be on fire working here. With their dead eyes and amoral seduction methods, it's easy to see why men become addicted to their aggressive fleshiness. One of the young men she seduces on the way is John Wayne, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama is set to end with a murder-suicide, a stoppage in Paris that's supposed to keep Lily quiet, and the new bank president, who's so addicted to Lily, that he's misappropriating the company's money, hard against the last third of the movie's luxury. An attached end is a little disappointing, but not before Stanwyck scorches the screen. The film has curious features, such as Lily's friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant, who teaches Lily the Nietzsche philosophy of how important it is to avoid sentimentality.
