Really ... and an incredible film that may not be very popular ... very touching and almost life changing ... for me at least. <br /> <br /> worth a visit and to buy ..... added Anyway to my favorite film list ... now the number one .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching Movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon ..... we are just amazing. The time now is my favorite film and I only saw him today. I would recommend him to any more than 15, as long as you are a bit ripe. If you do not really try to feel the emotions of the characters, you are I will never know the true meaning and value of this film ... But it's really incredible ... Look at it simply, because it is the way will change how some people look at life ... worth seeing 5/5
