The film will be released in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs found their way to the public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVD movies led to the release in theaters, and it still became public. <br /> <br /> The film is a great epic that brings Japanese culture to your home in an exciting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story is told about a playwright who writes a story for his theater, as the regular Kabuki play gets a bit boring. A bit confused about what story we're following, but as the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new Kabuki play. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark, if this is a story that has actually happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with a love of theater expression, vibrant colors, humor and tragedies make this a great ride on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema and the theater. <br /> <br /> Drop completely when you watch this movie, try watching it in a movie theater instead of in your TV at home. <br /> <br /> One critical point: The soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of the music is great, there are some moments in the movie that I think should be more dramatic. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor has also selected the director for lighter moments in the music.
