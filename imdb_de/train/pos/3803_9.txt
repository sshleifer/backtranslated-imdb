What people do not understand about this movie is that it's not beginning, middle and end. It's just the conclusion of a 26-year TV series. So remember, when you all talk about how the world has not been researched enough. That was all done in the TV show. <br /> <br /> As awesome and gorgeous as the picture is, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo was close to the end of the movie What really made me to love this movie. It was agonizing to watch characters fight me through 26 episodes, and Gwizdo, as he walked sadly alone among the floating ruins while Lian-chu sharpened his blade, was almost tearing. <br /> <br /> Then we got a total contrast as Lian-Chu fought against these amazingly fantastic dragons (previously featured in the series), while Gwizdo babbled insane and indirectly threatened to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this scene was not mentioned in the warnings anymore. Any child who has a bit of sense will realize that Gwizdo was not himself and had been focused on strangling the little girl. It was enough to bother me and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of it to go see my favorite characters. Listen. :)
