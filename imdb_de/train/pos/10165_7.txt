Actually, my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, he has the funny parts that deserve to see him, do not misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie in the world and he's not even original because he's an idea we did before have seen other films, but this has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this is a movie for friends ... I think that's not exactly, but who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same theme, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, Men, a very funny movie. See both, if you want, and I know you'll agree rock won with his movie. I would like it, that the protagonist male was handed over to Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
