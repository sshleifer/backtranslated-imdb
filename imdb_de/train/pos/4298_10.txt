This movie impressed me so much that I see it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. It's a movie that shows you the bizarre reality of living in LA, starting with the recurring heli searchlights looking for the dangers that lurk so close to the characters' ordinary lives. It's also a movie that shows you how the friendliness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intentional or not, has a major impact. I found this movie similar in many ways to Robert Altman's Short Cuts. Both had a star-studded list of perfectly cast actors and actresses, and in both films one could gradually see how the characters interacted and influenced each other, for better or for worse. Grand Canyon has been better able to convey a coherent message (hope in the face of desperate reality) than Altman's film, though I found both of them intriguing in their own way. This movie is an absolute must !!!
