There are two things I like about Elvira and they are both bigger than her and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. A movie is the best way to show how funny it can be or how it attracts attention. She looks like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith and inherits the fortune of a distant relative only to find that she is truly the heir to the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best part of it, but it could have been a lot scary. It's mostly a Campy fare with so many bad horror movie references like the insurgent mob or the fleeing heroine stumbling and stumbling on her heels. My favorite part is when she breaks her chains with her wonderful talents and keeps them locked up in the cemetery. The end is juicy cute, as if written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas act in the end seems too grand for this kind of movie.
