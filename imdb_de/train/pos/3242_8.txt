I saw this movie with my dad. I must've been quite young, about 15 years old. One afternoon it was Star Movies. The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could see that these robbers were gathering for a score. After the first half hour, it really has brought pace. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the storyline and the characters who try to handle a very strange score. The jokes are not cheesy, but at the same time subtle and extreme, which makes them so funny. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
