I see many films, good, bad and indifferent; There's usually something interesting to cling to, even if it's just solid design, or the dependable work of a good character actor, or the casual laughter that comes from watching the incompetence captured forever. <br /> I was pretty pleasantly surprised by this movie that I had never seen before. Of course, Graham Greene has been widely translated into movies, in masterpieces like "Thin Man" and in smaller vehicles. "Confidential Agent" is one of those smaller vehicles, but I still manage to get somewhere, despite the sluggish direction, the incongruity of the representations of Bacall and Boyer as (respectively) British and Spanish citizens, and the almost complete absence of chemistry that leads the two , In a way, this last "problem" actually works in favor of the film. How can love really arise in the deadly atmosphere of fascism and capitalism that meets the tragedy of a person? The most convincing aspect of the film comes directly from Green's complex and guilt-laden psychology that permeates the film. I know some see the intentional tempo here as boring and I can understand that. However, I found trotting to emphasize rather than distract the claustrophobic world. I was forced to watch, not by some great spectacle (though Boyer is wonderful as usual and manages to convey a rich mix of world fatigue, tragedy, hope, and fervor with his great voice and longing eyes), The Raging Onslaught of the Slender Hopes of a man against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does the profit and the exploitation end? The film does not rise to the level of art and therefore can not hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than just entertainment and its murders and guilt are very grimly drawn. The lack of glamor, "bubble", narrative "bounce" helps make this movie very worthwhile. <br /> <br /> And there is no happy ending, because the story was the end.
