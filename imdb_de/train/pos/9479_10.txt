Tian's remake is not good at all. I just click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress from the classic 1948 movie, say a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (March 28, 2010) after Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun was shown in the Hong Kong film Archiev. Wei Wei is nearly 90 years old and has silver hair. Her cameo appearances in Hong Kong films are always a surprise to her fans. At this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, Fei Mu, a director of this epic film, is dedicated to a special program. Wei Wei's filming is shown everywhere in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful back then.
