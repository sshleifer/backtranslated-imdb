"The time of day ended" is an incredible picture. In a way, it's better than "encounters of the third kind." (I prefer cheesy independent films rather than big budget spectacles.) The special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this film. It's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. The music is very good. History makes no sense. BUT THIS ONLY MAKES ALL INTRIGUING. Like many of the best works of art, "the time of the day is over" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. Although "the day time ended" is a low-budget indie film, it's not too much to compare it to the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (Many of them were independent low-budget productions.)
