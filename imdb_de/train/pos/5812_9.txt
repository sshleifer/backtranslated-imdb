Moonwalker is probably not the movie you should see if you are not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and have enjoyed the majority of the movie, the end was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were so - if you are a fan minutes are many times to see again. The dancing in each video is breathtaking, the music fantastic to hear and the dialogue entertaining. <br /> <br /> It contains many of his best videos of Bad and excerpts from his earlier videos. It also contains live concert material. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must if you're not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, you control well. <br /> <br /> 9/10
