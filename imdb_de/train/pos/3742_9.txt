I really enjoyed this movie, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here grouped him with other war movies, this movie was misclassified! It's not a war movie anymore, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," is an asylum film, or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about individuality, disagreement, self-esteem and the cost of this personality type. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", being in good company, and keeping it good. It is these films that you should fight against and compare, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
