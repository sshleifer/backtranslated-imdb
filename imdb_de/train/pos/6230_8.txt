1936 was the most productive year for Astaire and Rogers. Your second movie for RKO this year is the third movie in this collection? Mark Sandrich's "Follow The Fleet". This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a lay-by sailor who happens to stumble into the shabby waterfront caf√© where Sherry Martin (Rogers) drips romantic-sweet niches into everyone's ear. Yes, you guessed it? They are hot again on each other. Only this time, Sherry's Spinster sister Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens all the fine romance by betting on Bake's rugged navigator Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use 'em up and was' em guy forcing sherry to reconsider their opinion about all sailors in general. Irving Berlin lends the process with its classical, classical score immeasurable class. These include the standards "Let Yourself Go", "I put all my eggs in a basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance". The latter is a divinely-inspired sketch of suicide, which for Fred and Ginger becomes an instantly recognizable and thoroughly elevated pas deux. <br /> <br /> The transfer to 'Follow The Fleet' is a bit weaker. The grayscale stays well balanced, but now it looks a bit thick with not so much tonal variations as the previous tracks. Cereal is still available. Also age-related artifacts. Once you become familiar with the somewhat dense and sometimes softer focused image quality, the overall look of a film of this vintage is more than acceptable. The sound is mono but very well balanced. Extras include a featurette, a movie trailer and a short theme, but weird? no audio commentary Considering the importance of this movie in the overall canon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an unusual oversight of Warner Home Video.
