I rated this as ten just because I find it so impressive what an eighteen-year-old can do with a video camera. It's not an epic, but it's very stimulating and I was never bored. If tens of millions of dollars can flow into the myriad of bad movies that are poured out in bulk, then give that director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know that I will be in the local cinema for the first big release. Damn good job and worth the money. What a script! It could be a low budget, but it tops half of the most important pictures I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious praise to her, can not wait to see more.
