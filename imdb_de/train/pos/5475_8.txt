Finally, the uncut version of "Baby Face" is displayed and from which source? The Library of Congress. The restored four minutes, here and there a cut, make the movie much better. We now know that Baby Face was pimped by her old man from the age of fourteen. Another reason for her behavior and her cold, calculating appearance. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers (note the nickname), a part that demanded just the right amount of sexuality. With power, guile and vengeance, but if necessary with virginal claim, a very difficult and convincing account. Barbara Stanwyck conveys the nuances necessary to show that although she (literally) sleeps upwards, she is still good in the heart. Notice the way she treats the few who were so kind to her, like Chico (the wonderful actress) Theresa Harris) and the ancient philosopher. And while she uses her sexuality to pound out men who are rich and powerful, the same men try to exploit them for their carnal desires, without the intention of having a permanent bondage until they fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers does not understand that emotions are hard to ride and that it is easy to lose control. One possible result is death. To connect a car with a star, materialism can lead you to a destination where nothing but the ephemeral is present, and it's a cold lonely place. <br /> <br /> A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose "Will to Power" is emphasized in "Baby Face" by the older philosopher who befriends Lilly if she still loves her old man plays a trick. "Baby Face" was released when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that the half-educated Hitler understood much about Nietzsche, he considered himself a Nietzscheaner in the nth degree and proclaimed him next to his other cries. "Baby Face" is a charge against the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will to maintain power, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the cutest little baby face." apropos is a theme for "Baby Face", an even more enlightening and applicable tune is WC Handy's "St. Louis Blues" throughout the movie, especially at times when the camera has to move away from otherwise sexually explicit scenes. "St. Louis Blues" is also wisely used in the end, as Lily sees beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico sings a harsh, brisk version of "St. Louis Blues" as Lily, who does not agree with the lyrics, brings her to a halt. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the movie more modern in its attitude and attitude towards sex than power as many new Hollywood releases. Be sure to visit this gem from the distant past and enjoy it.
