More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need more sales for their talents. 7:35 De la ma√±ana is an absolute genius. What Nacho can convey in 8 minutes requires some Hollywood directors hours of film. I looked at that smile but felt a little dirty and not in a sexual way. You sit and wonder how you should feel after looking at these 8 minutes. Nugget I was entertained but disturbed at the same time. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. It starts very easy. A young woman comes in for breakfast at her usual place. She sits down and somebody starts to sing. From there, the movie takes you through so many different emotions that are hard to describe. It's in black and white, but this helps with the feeling the movie gives you. This movie wants to know more about the characters, their interaction and the impact of the end on their lives. I think it's like the old adage, "Let them do more," Nacho Vigalondo can. Watch this if you can. Show it to your friends and ask yourself how 8 minutes can be so much fun without getting undressed.
