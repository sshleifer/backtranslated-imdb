Jim Belushi is the "Average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bartender who not only listens to Belushi's "story," but is also a "mean" for all Belushi middle-class issues: a potion that causes an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life br /> flashbacks show a 15-year-old who was terribly ashamed because he had caused the championship defeat of his high school baseball team. Belushi continues his "miserable life," seemingly happy, but always wonders, "what if ...". Belushi experiences, it seems, several days, a "different" life the same measure. <br /> <br /> This is not quite "It's a Wonderful Life", but some elements are similar and very adorable. The "end" is predictable, but still satisfying. Look for a very young Cortney Cox, who in some ways is considered a "deadly magnet" - like other women. A very nice movie!
