This typical Mamet movie provides a quiet, even-going glimpse into what makes a trustman (Joe Mantegna) good. As a psychological study of a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse) explores, she slowly pulls her into his world with the usual unpleasant consequences. Performers include a number of players who have found Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, and William H. Macy), and they do their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie, and I've often wondered why she has not become a more distinguished player than she has become. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film continues at a slow pace with a flat dialogue, but maintains a level of tension that logically leads to the end of the stroke. In the end you expect a real disappointment, but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!
