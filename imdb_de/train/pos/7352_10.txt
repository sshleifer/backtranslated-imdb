This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I am now addicted! Okay, so it requires a different way of looking at US movies, but if you enjoy the pleasure of enjoying it, you will not be disappointed. The songs are outstanding, melodic and very catchy. The actors are above all Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in the film world, visually appealing. Places, colors are fascinating. If you want something different and want to get up, cheer and stimulate, I recommend you to watch this movie.
