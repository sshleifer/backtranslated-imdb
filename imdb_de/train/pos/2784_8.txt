Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family that is not particularly interested in girls in competitive sports. But our attractive young star can seriously play football. Rhys-Meyers trains Nagra and encourages her to perform while Knightley is a supportive player and friend. If a sis wedding is planned for the same day as the ultimate football game, what should a girl do? Similar to BFGW, Nagra tries to shift the envelope to traditional family paths. Here it is the father (well played by Kher) who can see both sides of the issue. A whole point for a later sexual orientation without crisis docked, if they needed filler, they could have gone elsewhere. Nice Final Wrap until the whole deal.
