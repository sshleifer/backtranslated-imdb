This was a popular Christmas special that I wish it would be released on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM was lost and all cassettes I've made are long gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John The fan of Denver, however, was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with Muppet spin (especially Little St. Nick!). It also contained a few well-known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Even though the late 70s, this show was timeless. I hope to find a copy soon !!!
