Sniper gives war films a new meaning. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, many shots, all dying, bam bam. "Sniper" brings war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly conveys all the emotions it targets: the helplessness of the people in the jungle, the hatred and ultimately the trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-budget movie makes up for every mistake with action, excitement and thrills, because when it comes down to it, it's just a shot, a kill.
