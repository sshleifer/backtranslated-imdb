Possible spoilers are: late-appearing cameos <br /> <br /> Rarely does one see so many beautiful and memorable character actors (almost exclusively actresses, to be exact) in one movie. Although some appear only for cameos, everyone is a gem. The Brits make this mix of comedy and real pathos better than any other IMO, so it's no surprise that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> The music is great; Undoubtedly, much had to be dubbed (does Leslie Caron * really play the bass so well? Maybe - who knew that?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm-hearted, inner sound still looks like a few other jazz singers. > <br /> As an aging musician himself, not so old and of course not in this class, it was also an encouraging movie - a great movie for anyone wondering if they pass by in their job or their age whatever it is. And of course a big celebration of stage life. <br /> <br /> I missed something of the opening but a makeshift 9/10 - and it makes us sure we want to see it all.
