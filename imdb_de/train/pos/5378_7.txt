This is an interesting little movie from 1967 featuring cool, jazzy, twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's cheesy fun. I have seen many similarities between this and "The Blue Handed Creature" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! The best thing about Scotland Yard is examining the murders of young ladies at a college. It looks like criminals are released from a local jail to fulfill the evil command, and then return when their job is done. There's a bible hidden in a bible that squirts hydrocyanic acid, and there's another device that's neither smart nor secretive. It looks like a large spray gun, and the victim must be soaked pretty close to the drain. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mainly chews gum and looks into the distance. There is a "monk", and how anyone identifies this thing as a "monk" is a mystery to me, he wears a whip and wears a red outfit with a red hood, more like a clan member of a different color than a monk. There are all sorts of clever devices, like a stove, that makes the monk go up and down, and he steps straight over the fire without lighting his robes, a clever trick here. This is a weird combination of thrillers with silly overtones, and though it's sometimes stupid, it's fun to watch them. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
