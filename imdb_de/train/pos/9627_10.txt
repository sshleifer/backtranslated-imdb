This is by far the funniest short film the two comic geniuses have ever done. From the moment Hardy falls from the roof, I laugh hysterically. I suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should be so short. I also recommend the entire Ghost series. If you're looking for a laugh, watch this movie and you'll be happy.
