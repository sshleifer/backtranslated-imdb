Since this is one of the most popular novels, I was really looking forward to the move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course there are a few things that I could choose, but I think the movie stayed true to the book and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King movies usually get a bad review, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story that I appreciate why I like it .. and what's better than the dead who come to life. If you've seen the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book now !! It's a well written script, the actors could have done a better job (I just say that to Rachel and Ellie ... she was so mean) agrees with the novel.
