Paul (Jason Lee) is an underachiever who happens to be engaged to a Type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses his clothes and his daily routine. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little too drunk and eventually he takes a pretty dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) home. "Nothing has happened," they say, but the duo wake up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen is on the phone. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul pushes Becky out of town, although her underpants are left behind. But there is more fun. At a family dinner in Karen's childhood home, Paul once again encounters Becky and learns that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about explanations you have to do! Instead, Paul decides to fake a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever know that Becky spent the night with Paul? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for critics who wave such films. You should definitely make it easier, because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, it does not hurt that Lee is a consummate, funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty, or that Blair is a natural but anal fianc√©. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also nice. The look of the film is wonderful, as are the costumes and attitudes in California. Best of all, the script is imaginative, inspired, and creates a big laugh for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. It's not Oscar material, but it's absolutely guaranteed that turning a bad day into a damn good day.
