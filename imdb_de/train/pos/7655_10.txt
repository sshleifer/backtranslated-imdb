After not seeing this movie in about 20 years, I am still impressed by the harsh effect and the outstanding acting. Of course, a Mr. Mickey Rooney in his role as the leading killer of the ring is indeed INCREDIBLE. (Regarding another report here - none other than Orson Welles has named Mickey Rooney as the greatest movie actor.) I also remember the jazzy-brassy score and the sheer black and white photography. I love Mick's last line before he goes beyond his dose of lead poisoning. (I think the Stranglers raised them for a line in one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) This is a great movie that's unjustly buried. Let's get it out! Side Note - a recent movie review magazine reported in detail on Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", a few years before "Last Mile" and with Mickey Rooney. Another rave of Mick's intense and likeable performance. This may well be the beginning of a fundamental momentum of recognition for some truly superior film screenings.
