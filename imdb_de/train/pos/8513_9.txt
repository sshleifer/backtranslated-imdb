I have always had the philosophy that every single person has a different taste, I thought this movie was fantastic and I think every student out there could agree with me. Nevertheless, it is not a "movie with plot", it is about real men and some of the "problems" they face. I found the movie hilarious (especially the parts in which they played the practical jokes together). Simply put, if you are in the same wavelength as these people, you will find this movie amazing. I do not think this will win Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people in this movie will be future Hollywood stars, but it's a kind of "cult classic" among young people who can relate to their experiences. For me, the guy who stands out the most is Hans, the Scandinavian who, in his words, is "not an eye-catcher" but gets all (or some) of the chicks. The "little people" also play a big role in the movie, especially when they are drunk. If I carry on, I could provide a spoiler and I do not want to do that. Just go and get the movie and you will not regret it. I give an 8/10
