Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaptation ever. No wonder, as King himself wrote the screenplay. The story is about the Creed family who moved to a beautiful house in Maine. One of the other inhabitants is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a lot about the area. One is the highway that runs straight through her front yard. The other is a path that leads to the Pet Sematary, where children have been burring the highway-killed animals for decades. Soon Ellie Creed's cat has been found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family except for Louis (the father) is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground, behind Pet Sematary, where the church is to be buried. Later, Louis (not so polite) is greeted by Church. He has returned and seems to have chewed from the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more can I say without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the King's adjustments I've seen, this would be the most terrible. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job in directing. The tension is kept fairly high throughout the movie, partly due to the plot's evolution. The scene where Gage is killed will be remembered forever. Then of course we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what's going to happen, but Lambert pulls out some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. If you like being scared and do not mind being followed by occasionally disturbing pictures, then Pet Sematary is exactly what you are looking for. Non-horror fans want to avoid this.
