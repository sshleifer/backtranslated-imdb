Fabulous movie! Rented the DVD recently and was moved from this stunning work. Douglas Sirk was a brilliant filmmaker. He has appearances by Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nomination) and Lauren Bacall, who can not describe words. Paul Verhoeven was a great tribute to the film as Dorothy Malone played Sharon Mord's inspiring guru in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> The movie is alternately hilarious, intriguing, pugnacious, biting, trashy, captivating and exciting! It's definitely the forefather of every shabby big and small screen soap opera, but no one had the dazzling style you'll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening montage is fixed at first glance unmistakable, the one-dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final picture leaves you scratching your head as the censors made the final cut! <br /> <br /> While most are older, highly regarded movies can sometimes be a boring job to get through. Written on the Wind contains so much and passes so fast that it is a pity when it ends. Many thanks to Mr. Sirk for crafting - and Todd Haynes for the attention that has become one of my favorite movies of all time! SEE THIS FILM !!!
