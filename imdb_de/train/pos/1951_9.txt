A single mother (Diane Keaton) works several minimum wage jobs. When she is fired, she realizes that she can not feed her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter of whom has asthma. Then she goes to her friend and sells drugs. Soon she will become addicted to the drugs she sells. Her life collapses, especially when her children, her eldest son, learn the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she has difficulty saving herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug addicts she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This movie has some of the best spectacles I have ever seen! Diane Keaton has played way too much, and her character is crazy, but she was very convincing. She is much better for drama than comedy. The best performance in the film, however, comes from Michael Seater, who plays her eldest son. He is perfect as a responsible son who is still young but tries to be the adult in the family. His acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronted his mother with the drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie that pays off especially for the acting of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton.
