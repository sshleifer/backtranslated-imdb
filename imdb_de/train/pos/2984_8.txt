David Zucker has staged one of the most beautiful comedies of the year with this silly farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends on a wealth of sophomoric gags, but unlike some recent comedic efforts, it's consistently funny. The movie is packed with a variety of jokes ranging from the obvious obvious to the more subtle, that you have to watch out for everything in the picture, otherwise you'll probably miss them. As with his previous efforts, which included "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And belonging to "Naked Gun", the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is the fact that it has a real plot. While others have relied on making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (please take "Mafia!"), This movie tells a new story with sympathetic characters. It touches on sports films in general, as well as the satirizing of the real sports industry, rather than glossing over certain films. Even for people who are not interested in "South Park," their creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are a good pair of leading natural chemistry actors. The film also uses extremely effective cameos of athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially a funny piece with Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries. By the way, stay with Bob Costas and Al Michaels for the last joke. All in all, sugar, in words perhaps for the sports mix of the movie, has achieved a home dunk.
