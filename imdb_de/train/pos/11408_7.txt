Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the kind of person that people would almost never know by name. However, he again plays the coroner - one of the only actors in the films of Philo Vance who have played his role more than once. I've seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and fresh. This film is also great to watch, because besides Girardot there are many other wonderful character actors - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive cast, and they certainly made the senior man and wife Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce lighter. <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the main reasons why I love these old B-Movies. While the mystery itself is rarely so great, the films really satisfy the airy writing and acting. As far as the movie is concerned, Vance is wonderfully played by Lowe, but as I said, the mystery itself is just a reflection - with a stupid plot involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything like this - I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something the evil in the movie could do, I would have done it! Used car salesman and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious goals !! <br /> <br /> Overall, it was not the best Philo Vance movie, but it was very good and it's a shame that Lowe played this role only once. Apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hindered by a long, long line of actors including Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is a similar problem that plagued the Bulldog Drummond series too - just too many different actors playing the lead man. <br /> <br /> Interesting and exciting - but also quite impossible.
