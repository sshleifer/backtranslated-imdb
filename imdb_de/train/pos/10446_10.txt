I saw this movie 10 years ago. and have seen it an average of once a year since then. This kind of movie is timeless because the themes are universal and the stories and the conversation are so personal. It is also one of the few films you capture from the first image to the credits, though there are really only two (very involved) characters. this is thanks to the dedicated acting of hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. This is also the first movie in which I mentioned the reality TV. Now the phenomenon is widespread! I love the way this movie wraps the audience in its space, and makes you think, however you may, that you're one of those characters. It also made me travel by train through Europe! I have not met anyone yet who could not relate to this movie. Maybe that speaks of me, my friends or just the genius of this movie.
