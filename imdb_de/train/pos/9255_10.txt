If you want to have fun with subtle humor then you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would not like this movie. Take it for what it is: a vehicle that makes Dennis Hopper confuse your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's done well. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this regard - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a sense of subtle humor. Too bad that she did not have many opportunities to expand that. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits in perfectly with his role as a "real marine," and William McNamara does a good job as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Take a walk-on from Hopper to the middle of the hunt for "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that kept my attention and made me laugh. I bought it as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-Candy.
