Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. They always want to see more. I wonder what the secret of Alicia hides. I think I saw this movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Besides, I usually do not cry about movies, but this one made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like this. All in all, I found it a great movie. The more you observe, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that really impressed me when she cried at the high school because her daughter's name was. My heart felt like it was broken. And how she was comforted by her new friend when she had not gotten her yet. I loved it so much.
