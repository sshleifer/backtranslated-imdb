I was adopted at birth and certainly did NOT have the problems Antwone had in the movie, but I still share some emotions and this movie really helped me get them out and force me to deal with them. It even made it clear to me that I have a "missing piece" and I will now look for my birth. <br /> <br /> I cried for almost a day after seeing this for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his birthing mother, which is contrasted with his father's reaction to his sudden appearance, is for those of us who do not know what happens when we find our birth parents. And his self-confidence and self-affirmations towards his mother and against the perpetrators of his past were so powerful. I could really identify with that and my need to tell people, "Yes, I was rejected by my parents at birth, BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me, and now I am successful!" <Br /> <br /> It also helped my wife to understand me and our adopted children, who had tragic experiences before they came to our home. And it helped me to see how confused our social system is. If you remember reading last year's story about the foster-child in Florida that was "lost," and then the "Miranda & Ashley" story in Oregon City, in the SCF, several lawsuits about sexual abuse of the man ignored, who finally killed her AND this week was published this movie, another story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system. One died. The state apparently thought the house was alright because the guardian was busy (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many problems in this film - and they are so well handled by the script and acting that Antwone Fisher should surely be a "Best Picture" nominee. Whether you are adopted or not, it is a heartbreaker that can not be ignored by anyone who cares about children in our society.
