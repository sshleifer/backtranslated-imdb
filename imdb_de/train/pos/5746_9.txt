Words are really not enough to convey the emotional power of this film; It's one of the worst you've ever seen, but the end is one of the loveliest, most affectionate, and emotionally most fulfilling you can hope for. Every actor in each role is great, especially a wise and unobtrusive Jamie Lee Curtis, a tight wounded Ray Liotta, and a heartbreaking twist from Tom Hulce that would have earned him for every award in the book. (He's No. 1 for 1988's Best Actor in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars.") The last half hour borders on the melodrama, but the movie brings tears to everyone - and if they're not rock, it will be many of them ,
