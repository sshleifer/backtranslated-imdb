Groove Tube is 35 years old today and looks like real TV! Special niche networks, a television show about stoner drug dealers, the dealers (ala Weeds and even before 1978 Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke), weird beer ads (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls), dirty Koko (shades by Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase, who made slapstick humor (a violent barbershop vocal duo) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube a first X rating, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking of naked hitchhiking hippies ---- See for similar skit-style movies TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Behind the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and the Firesign Theater everything you know is wrong.
