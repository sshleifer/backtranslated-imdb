I saw that on Dances with Films and it was great. I really felt like Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents divorced, but there is a monster behind you. <br /> <br /> It was both profound and frightening - there were several moments when the audience screamed in true fear. It somehow reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, only that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separated "Jake's Closet" from the usual Indy movie lab - a great script with captivating characters. By mixing elements of horror film with family drama, the film gets the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If it's not in the cinemas, be sure to buy the DVD.
