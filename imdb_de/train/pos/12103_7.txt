I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I did not like and have always been a fan of good ghost stories (especially for wonderful pictures like "The Legend of Hell House") and the original versions of "The Haunting" " and "House on Haunted Hill"), I felt like "Castle of Blood" would be in my alleyway, and boy, was it ever! This Franco-Italian co-production is not the classic, Steele's first horror movie "Black Sunday" to this day, however, is an extremely atmospheric, frightening introduction to the haunting genre, shot in black and white, giving it a truly scary miasma.The film is about a journalist referring to a Lord Blackwood and an author Edgar Allen Poe claims that he can spend the night of All Saints' Day on Blackwood's night, when the ghosts of those killed in the castle reenact their fate, the viewer sees these deaths and s They're pretty awful most of the time. The movie does in fact make a shiver on the back of the viewer, and on the uncut DVD I've just seen - thanks to the good people of Synapse - it even offers a surprising topless scene and a mild Lesianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie. Her otherworldly beauty is exploited by a sympathetic ghost. Their mere presence turns a spooky ghost story into something truly memorable. It was not for nothing that she was called "The Queen of Terror".
