One of my favorite films so far starts as an adventure through the wild side of a four-man team from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it was turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynolds Lewis, who unconsciously sinks his guys into their worst nightmare. If the first half of the movie looks more like an action movie, the second half takes the viewer into a completely different story, forcing our men to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In a very bad way. At the end of the film, each person will be forced to deal with the scars of something that had to have been a fairly quiet weekend over the weekend, but muffled in a fight for survival. The film (except for some pretty obvious things) is very well directed and beautifully shot in a natural paradise that takes your breath away. The photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty all excellently show how a single event can ruin four different lives tied to the same mistake.
