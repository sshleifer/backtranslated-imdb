I'm not an ordinary commentator on this site, but since I underestimated this movie, I try to write comments and comments about it. I enjoyed watching this movie, maybe because Cat is everything I wish, I could not post spoilers or reveal plans, but there are things that I really enjoy. The way she manipulates people is just so divine. This is a very underrated movie, I lack arguments here, I enjoy it and enjoy talking about it a little when you go to the cinema to have fun, and I have the 1h53 I spent in the dark room I really enjoyed it. One has to be seen again and again, until the joy fades. Let's not be so critical. Thank you for reading.
