I was lucky to see "Oliver". 1968 on a big movie screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later in the summer of 1969, I was delighted that this film was still in a prominent movie theater in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for best picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" Both on stage and on screen, I remembered that not every talent on Broadway starts and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was brought to the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming musical became a hit in New York and around the world. The film was shot in the summer of 1967 in England and published in 1968. The sets and the music numbers are overwhelming. The song "Who will buy?" Hundreds of actors needed it, and the British film director really deserved his Oscar for putting everything together seamlessly. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but it is above all a tribute to the fine craft of British film studios like Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham, and Ealing have many films to offer the world over the years.
