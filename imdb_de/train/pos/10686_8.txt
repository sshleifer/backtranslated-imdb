And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I would pay for her to read the Moscow phone book and hear what she might have done to my knowledge when speaking Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four principles are excellent, but the film itself is a series of good pictures and better scenes that are held together by nothing. <br /> <br /> Always ready to expose unbelief When watching a movie, it asks too much of the viewer. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (which it partly is) or pretty scary (which it is in a scene), but the director did not seem to know which way to go.
