Chris and Andre are two average, ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and taken up by others. But together they stand and everyone will pay. Together they form "The Army of Two". You plan and plan "Zero Day". That day, they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood. Told by the cassettes that they have made "Zero Day", it's hardly a fictional narrative about the tragedy of Columbine. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of the movies that gets infected with your head afterwards. The two main characters (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost all disenfranchised teenagers walking on the street. Their performances were very believable, the guys liked them somehow and that was scary. Almost taped on from the perspective of the teenager, "Zero Day" feels very real and authentic as if you were right there. These children try to streamline their actions to the viewer, and the actors sell it to you. But be warned, it follows the tragedy from start to finish, and the ending is shocking and uneasy for some.
