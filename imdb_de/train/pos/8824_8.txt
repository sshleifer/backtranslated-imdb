One woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur), enters a restaurant one morning and does not know that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in this restaurant and gets them to play a musical number in this strange but intriguing short I only seen it on the DVD of the equally fascinating "Time Crimes" of the director / writer to find. It had a pretty catchy song and somehow it brought a smile to my face, despite the bleak overall plot. I am glad that I stumbled upon it (did not know that this would be an extra if I borrow the DVD) and would without hesitation recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My grade: A-
