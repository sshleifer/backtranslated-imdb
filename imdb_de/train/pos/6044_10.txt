A great British Indy movie! The fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters is just some of the funky drugstacks that Cheech and Chong might be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he switched sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! I loved the last fight scene with Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire at Top of the Pops ... ... he does not play ... he's really a good British Hippie !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy it, and it's right in my collection of Friday night re-take cameras after the pub. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed.
