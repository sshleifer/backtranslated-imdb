Fifteen years later, Paris Is Burning is still burning. This is a classic in black gay movies, topping with the other black gay-rated films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures underground and subclass (ie "underserved") black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since, including all the sentimental retrospectives and renderings of gay Harlem Rennaissance gays I say, the only "real" movie, you will find on this topic. It's "Relentlessy Cunty" (the classic house music invention) that comes to Hollywood, an uninterrupted, funny camp (as only we do) and total social criticism. All this from a white director (who in one's past life is obviously one Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing.) I could go on, but I think you got the point now: I love this movie!
