This is an exquisite movie about finding happiness in everyday life. The pace, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting music and the pure charm of this image make it a must. Immature or emotionally stunted people do not appreciate it so easily. The only mistake I can see in this movie is that it was not recorded in a more technically perfect movie format. It deserves Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best sound format. (An intimate film can be shot in 70 millimeters.) The magnificent Italian villa effect on its inhabitants would have been even lush and the little beautiful moments would be even more beautiful seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as a sweet, moving little movie. I can not help but watch it every time it's on satellite. The transformation of the characters from reserved, narrow and suspicious is always a pleasure to see and I should really recommend them more often. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is about reproach. It's a middle-aged movie and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful, without beating the viewer with hard handedness. Watch it in a session and let it take in you. If you do not understand it, you may not have lived enough or something else is wrong with you.
