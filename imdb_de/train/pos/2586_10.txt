The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was excellently tuned, the pyro effects were masterfully executed, and it takes a basic love triangle story and throws in a science fiction element. I was able to identify with many characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the context of the story. <br /> <br /> The camera work was great, the sound was clear and accurate, the background music perfect for the action, the singing firemen a beautiful, talented, catchy curiosity, the sets brilliantly designed and the special effects performed with a talented talent. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit confused as a whole mini carnival works in the parking lot of a chain store. The lot could be powered by a single lamppost socket. That does not seem to be the order of the day. The fight between the brothers towards the end of the film, however, was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was also a wonderful touch as he played the half-serious role of a carnival very well.
