I love watching this movie because of all the scary scenes about the birds of prey. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are those with the Raptor looking behind the pillar because he reminds me of a scene from the Friday, the 13th movie, with the girl who eats the banana. <br /> <br /> I really like to watch a lot This movie comes out because the computer graphics seem a bit spotty, but it's fine, because once you get into the movie, you hardly notice what's going on, and I think it's going well, although I did not really understand what was going on on my computer first few visits I've found over time, and that's the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be when you first see them. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE.
