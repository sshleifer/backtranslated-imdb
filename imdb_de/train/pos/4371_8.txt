When Braveheart first came out, I was intrigued and admittedly one of the greatest fans of the film. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. Over time, however, my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished. Braveheart is great entertainment, but there are also shortcomings. The most significant in my opinion is the unflattering portrayal of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another reason is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which obscures the film in relation to the many historical distortions. I think it bothers me too that in retrospect, this movie (at least mine) saw that the beginnings of Mel Gibson's egomania are clearly visible for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes that Braveheart most cares about. But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine and gets more mature and complex with every sight.
