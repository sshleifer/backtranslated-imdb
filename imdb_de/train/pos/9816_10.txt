Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I saw that, I thought, why do they have to do all these things? It's not right, but they learned their lesson when they found the wrong man! Anyway, if you ever see this movie on TV, look at it because it's good!
