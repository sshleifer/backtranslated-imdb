Saving Grace is a beautiful movie that you can watch on a boring afternoon if you're looking for something other than the usual script and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana is so crazy! It was the first movie I saw with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that does not really criticize it, just jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has had many financial problems with her dead husband, who has committed suicide, since he was in debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagined she could save some money for her, finds out that she has to pay all her husband's debts so as not to lose all her belongings, especially her house, which she loves so much. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener, enthusiastic about the smokehouse, decides to partner with her on selling marijuana on a large scale.
