Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He of course stays at the Hollywwod Hotel. At the same time, the big selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a temper tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new image. In panic, the studio leases Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to impersonate her, and Bowers is due to premiere her without saying it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can pretty well find out the rest of the story yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it nicely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very likeable couple and have beautiful voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in music sequence (Edgar Kennedy doing his patented, slow burning). Glenda Farrell also has some fun things as Mona's sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> Even so, the movie is not that good. The rest of the cast gets cruel and the humor is just not funny. Above all, Lola Lane is just lousy when she tries to play Mona for the comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid laughs and there is a really terrible racist "humor". That probably lasts most of the time. I know that it was accepted then, but it seems repugnant today. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie with serious problems, supported by a good cast and some great songs. I give a 7.
