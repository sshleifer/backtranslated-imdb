Since I am not an actor of Snoop Dogg, I have dealt even more with this movie. I remember being interviewed on "Jay Leno" and saying that he refused a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in that movie. Apparently, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove he was acting. I will not overrate Snoop for his performance in The Tenants. There are certainly better rappers / actors like Mos Def who could have done more with his role. But the point is that Snoop has done "good" work. He does not seem to shake off some of his typical body movements and vocal inflections, but even Jack Nicholson is a problem. The point is, I found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character was intriguing. Incidentally, McDermott delivers the best performance in the movie, though its subtle drama is most likely overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle acting. Being a great reader and aspiring author myself, I could not help but find the characters and draw something fascinating. It made it worse for me that Snoop's character constantly asked McDermott to read his work and scold him for his criticism. But, you know what? I am sure that many authors are like that. His character should be flawed in his own way, like McDermott's. My only mild criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, it felt too hectic for me, though the resolution made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than the plot.
