This story has never been one of my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to fully enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective when it was a little over the top, the bones of the story are present, though the subplot "Crime in the Past" is more emphasized. The students were all the way I had imagined, though it was a pity they were not more cosmopolitan - maybe the revised version of the 1930s did not allow that! I thought some very daring risks were involved in the shooting; Maybe it's because I did not read the book much longer, but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the killer was, because in some exposed photos he appeared early early early poirots. Sometimes it works, but I've found a lot of it quite difficult in this episode (though I smiled at the 'Lemon Sole' throw-in line). All in all, a solid entry into the series, although he is not the best.
