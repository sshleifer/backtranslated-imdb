I realized that this movie was devastated long before it went to the cinemas and I did not have much hope either. I thought it was a different kind of "You Got Served", with great dance moves and terrible drama. I went to the theater and chose between the Meet the Spartans and chose that. To my surprise, the acting was not bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage released here, I recommend seeing a matinee show of this movie so you do not spend too much. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised how wrong everyone was. When it comes to dance films, this is certainly one of the better ones with far better acting than many others. Look at the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will increase after it's released on DVD, and more people will check out the movie instead of commenting on it before the movie is released. <br /> <br /> edit Over 1000 people rated it 9, a bit too high, but at least it helps to make up for the ridiculous votes of 1.
