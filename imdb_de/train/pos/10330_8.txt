This is actually a trilogy of three short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is dismissed from his church job because he can neither read nor write. So what does he do? Of course, open a tobacconist! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, a story I read for school 6 years ago and immediately forgot until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes and also very good. It worked better in the movie than in a book for me, but that may be because I was only 14 years old at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> The third is almost a flop. For almost an hour, it just pulls out. It's not that bad, but not as fast and snappy as the last two. I looked at the first quarter of an hour and then I moved on to the last quarter of an hour, and found that it still makes sense, and I really had no overlooked business! <br /> <br /> Overall I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10 points.
