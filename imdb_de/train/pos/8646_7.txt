In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV movie called Too Young To Die, in which they played almost the same games as in California. I have no doubt that this led to her casting in this great movie. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia finds up-and-coming writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes, in a rocky relationship based on Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting into the thoughts and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has planned a most unusual odyssey, he wants to go abroad and visit the sites of some famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are broke. <br /> <br /> Destiny intervenes in more than financial terms with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the fuel costs on this cross country excursion. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer and he decides to do some research himself and deal with someone who is fascinated by amorality. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the kind of movie I normally can use, but in fact, Brad Pitt's acting skills and charisma make it a big part. Pitt is the walking definition of a gothic inbred refugee from Deliverance. But better than him is Juliette Lewis, who again plays these low self-esteem types, which she seems to be doing well. Watch her scene with Forbes while she's doing her hair and Lewis describes her sad and miserable life. Lewis 'dialogue and Forbes' reactions should be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their Slasher movies, they are no better than California.
