I saw this movie one night with some friends. I did not really hear much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribisi's acting performance needed some excitement. But such a small mistake, it could be overridden. Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who has to recharge 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The movie is in no way predictable. So the end should be a surprise. Do you think it's just another fast car movie? Well, you are partly right. There is much more. Everyone should watch this movie.
