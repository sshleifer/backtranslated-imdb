I did not expect much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised because it is easy, funny and very well watched. The central trio of deadbeat bikers was surprisingly sympathetic when they stumbled and gossiped through their drug-centered journey to Wales. The humor was gentle and subtle, just like the three characters (testify to their sympathetic treatment of the little old shopkeeper). The atmosphere of rural Wales was captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Wise and carefully written, with great attention to detail - I've never seen such a realistic depiction of alternative culture - I felt I was with them. Very easy in contact and fun - not what you can expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A joy on all fronts and difficult to criticize, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall an unexpected movie treasure.
