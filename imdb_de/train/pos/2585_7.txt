Here is a rare treasure for those of you who have not seen it yet, or most likely you have not heard. In the 80s Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films that unfortunately bombarded everyone. Two of those films that I really liked, and let me go into one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wild Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard) are ... Firelighters: Yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder, after a fatal incident in his youth, decided not to use his power (not useful anyway) when he and his brother blew up an abandoned house in which a man was was killed, who was unaware of them. Nowadays, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the crazy Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, guess, arson (see the movie for a better understanding). Wilder has not spoken to Wallace for 5 years because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party. Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for entertainment. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When the carnival arrives in Wilder's town, Wallace decides to meet again with his brother and see Vida Wallace fell in love with! Vida's house arrest is over, but Wilder is busy. So Wallace enters and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some great fireballs throwing in this streak ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The film also has some really weird but funny elements, like Wilder's Fire Brigade sings the songs acapella in firefights and on stations. Jim Varney (known worldwide as "Ernest") appears as a Wallace Redneck carnival friend. "Wild Napalm" has brilliantly shot ... and skillfully put together ... very out of the way and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Look at this ...
