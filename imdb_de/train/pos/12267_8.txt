Tim was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. I borrowed the books from the school library at every opportunity. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant depiction of the background story of Herge and his development by Tintin. The personal experience of the filmmaker interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character were very moving. A great example of someone who is known internationally and has brought joy to millions of children (and the young at heart) around the world.
