This movie has cost a lot of stick. It was planned by critics when it came out, and was blamed for destroying Nicolas Cage's career. I do not think people assume it's not an epic, Oscar contender for a movie, it's just a brilliant "Bruck-Buster" action at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. For those who like cars, it's a real treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and does not forget Eleanor! I think it would be hard for you to find a better action movie and personally a better movie! Then maybe that's just me!
