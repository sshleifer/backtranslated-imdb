In an attempt to establish the audience's empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers. Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invasion force. The Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to own slaves, to choose crooked legislators and judges, and to use a system of political corruption. There is nothing noble in it. The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> History seems to me to have nothing to do with ambiguity. If Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, that's not because he saw mistakes on his way. He does not yield to the virtue of the cause of the abolition.
