In a really varied cast this show meets FOX. It's the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you only watch one show, you might not like it very much, but if you see two or three, you'll become addicted. <br /> <br /> This is because some of the jokes beat and some miss, depending on how you see them. As usual today, the topics are very mature. The humor is usually very ripe too. The funniest parts are often the parts where the mature topics collide with the innocent ones. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith), a seasoned actor, does very good, top-notch humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble as well. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of the kids, is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in earlier shows than natural redhead (who had the idea to make her blonde?). She often shows very good talent and comedic timing. She cuts a fine figure even without make-up. <br /> <br /> This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom section and the most successful live action movie since Married With Children
