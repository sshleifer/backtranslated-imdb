The movie has pleasantly surprised me. Let's be honest; While the premise may not sound appealing if she has to spend money on the nightly movie, she has a loose nature that convinces her. There were no moments when I was rebellious, and I doubt I'll remember the next day, but that does not fail as a nice distraction. What I found funny was to see it here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands what I like. I told her there was a conspiracy - three guys have to bring some weeds to London. Hardly satisfactory for her. Here is not a raid for the camera I expected after reading some comments. However, I make an exception to comparisons with Withnail and myself; not in the same league, and I doubt it was intended. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
