This is different than in any other movie. The best I can compare to that is a Woody Allen movie ... But with Woody Allen constantly exploring human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to find a way to deal with a crippling insecurity that tends to make us better or worse poorly defined. In the case of Lou, this is the cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a unique childhood trauma revealed by flashbacks. There are so many weird neurotic people in the world and I believe that they all deserve a chance of salvation, even though the diversity of the human nature makes the world so intriguing, so perhaps we should not be able to repair our neurosis more than our noses or breasts /> <br /> This is an indie movie shot at a long shootout, but the production values ​​are enormous, as is the scope of the movie. I feel like a quirky gem for the self-help market. I'm really looking forward to seeing what this filmmaker will do next. I could imagine a career like Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, even if a guy like this breaks through, he goes out and does "X MEN" and his modest quirky character origins are soon forgotten or are they ... X Men is a bunch Freaks, if I remember correctly :)
