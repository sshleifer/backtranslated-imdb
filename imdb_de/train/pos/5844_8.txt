This was my favorite movie in 1948. Betty Grable's costumes were so gorgeous that I wanted to become her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks jr. Was irresistible as the brisk Hungarian officer. Silly and fluffy, as this film may seem at first glance, when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about the relationships between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was surprised it still was.
