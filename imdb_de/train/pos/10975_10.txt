The daughter's words are poetry: "I can not live another year, I have to go to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a deciduous sea." "The marble faun is moving in ... he just gave us a washing machine, that's the deal." "I'm pulverized by this latest thing." ".. Raccoons and cats get bored for too long." "... a small rat's nest, a mouse hole I would prefer." And in the words of the mother is wisdom: "... yes, the pleasure is entirely mine." "This little book will keep me straight, just like a dye." "You always have to do everything right." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have to have professional music." "I am your mother, do you remember me?" The mother-daughter relationship is drawn in this great movie. This is a Mother's Day movie.
