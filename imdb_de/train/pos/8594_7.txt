The Sentinel, which I hoped would be a good movie, and the boy, I was right. A great story, especially from a novel, and I thought this was an original story, but I think that was not and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is, but it's very hard to push him out of his role as Jack Bauer in 24, but in the end, you do and he's very different in The Sentinel than in 24 however, another person trying to shake off her TV role failed. Eva Longeria. She was not so good in the movie and had a backseat in the whole thing. After watching the movie, I always had dreams of The Sentinel and could not sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
