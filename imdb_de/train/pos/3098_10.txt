I loved this show so much and am so incredibly sad it was canceled and I thought it would come back as well, but only two stupid weeks. That's awful. I hate how we never figure out how everyone ends up. it sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and Whatnot, but does not give time to good shows like Six Degrees. If they were complaining about ratings, it was probably because they had a bad slot because it was really a good show that I could do something with and expect. JJ Abrams delivered, he is great. I wish ABC could just trust him enough to finish the story. I also loved the entire cast. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet one day. The history of all is now incomplete, now I never know if Steven and Whitney will get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really a downer.
