"SÃ¥ som in heaven" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. That it did not win the Oscar, I will shed no tears. This movie is in a class of its own, that an Oscar win might distract from it !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made true splendor here with your pen! Kay Pollak, with your creation and all who contribute, have given all of our world a gift of love. Between the points of entering this world from us, then leaving it - you can truly say that you have done better! A special personal thank you from my soul to you all, that you have brought back precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden and my young mind and being Beingness was shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings thank you all. With love and light, George Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
