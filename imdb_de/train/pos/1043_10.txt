Since then, I can remember, and I'm only 18 years old, my mother and I have been watching older movies, because I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but they do not get me wrong.) I love the movies we do I just do not have as much love today as I love movies of the 40s and 50s.) Well, I have to say, as soon as I saw the movie, my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... behaved in the least like children. But there's a good reason you spent most of your life hiding and walking when you saw how dreadful things children saw when these children destroyed their innocence. People said, "Oooo, I hated how the kids acted ... blah blah blah," reading between the lines, knowing that they saw things children should not see. Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know that a lot of people are crazy, that he did not go to the Oscars and Bogie, but they both did an amazing job, so I think it could have gone either way. But Lukas's performance was so amazing that I cried out at the end of the movie. I loved this movie so much and would recommend it to anyone !! :-D
