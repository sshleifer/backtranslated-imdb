Alain Resnai's films are scary in the way that they are not really cut to continuity, but the shot seems to end up exactly where a memory was edited. Love to Death is at times a quiet existential drama and an all around creative magical realism movie, and the audience will definitely be spoiled with a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or maybe it will create a new relationship, the Agape / Thanatos The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie. A woman runs desperately around the house while a man dies in his bed - did she kill him or what happened? This tension soon dissipates when a doctor comes and declares him dead, but from there begins a newer, stranger drama: The man wakes up, and after he is dead, wife and husband fall in love with rather tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, are observing their own debate in the form of love, faith, and devotion, and are presenting their own debate. Resnais always seems to have a means to get these kind of stories going. What's so amazing about his films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais cuts the scenes with snow-covered recordings into an exciting orchestral score, which is hidden in the subsequent recordings that continue the story. Trapped periodically in this elegiac side, the film develops a rhythm not too dissimilar to an epic poem, and I have received strange flashbacks to Dante's divine comedy, though there is no direct reference in this film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but beyond the cinepoem structure to something that forces the viewer a degree of self-observation, which has the potential to bring some strange memories to the surface. Memory narrative creates resnais. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
