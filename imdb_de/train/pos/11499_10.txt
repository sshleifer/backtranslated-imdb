Since the show was only a toddler on the show, I recently bought the DVD set and wished there were more episodes filmed. This show was a 70s version of the popular 90s TV series "X-Files" - but with a slightly weirder approach. But do not get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, and many of them have some pretty cruel acts (left to the imagination - this was the television of the early 1970s). <br /> <br /> Some of the acts were a bit silly and acting, but that's the charm and attraction of this series. Whether you like mystery thrillers, comedies, or sci-fi / horror themes, this series brought it all together. Each episode had about 50 minutes (1 hour in commercials) and those 50 minutes go by fast and always make me want more. A great classic show underestimated in my book!
