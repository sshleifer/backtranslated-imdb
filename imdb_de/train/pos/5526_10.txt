I love the cinema, and what I will concede will deeply embarrass me. I had banned "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. Terrible I know But I felt trapped by ... who? I do not really know, but there was negative word of mouth spreading like a wild fire. No matter how smart I think, I've fallen for myself. Luckily, I met an Argenean director, Martin Donovan, a man whom I love and admire. When I told him I did not see it because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he were ready to slap me in the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I saw both parts and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I saw in 2008. Of such purity, he will remind you of the work of some great masters of the past. Respect for the audience is something we are no longer used to. I do not know if we ever were. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. The humanity of man is overwhelming. Thanks again to Martin Donovan for raising me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all involved in this milestone movie. Do not commit the mistake that I wanted to commit. Now you see it on the big screen
