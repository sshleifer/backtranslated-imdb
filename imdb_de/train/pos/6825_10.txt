I was absolutely thrilled with John Cassavetes Opening Night. It's the first movie I've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale, so it feels more mainstream, but it still does not feel like it's anchoring itself more than in its previous films , That maybe makes it so intense. The reputation of this film is undoubtedly something special. <br /> <br /> It's about what made Cassavetes an integral part of his career, an ideal he has expressed throughout his career as a director behind the camera, and here it is in the forefront. Rowland's character, middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, can not bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as she was written, and she's immeasurably followed impulse by impulse, which looks like chaos on stage until she's done finds the right one. It's a daring abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not catch the innate control one goes through during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does so many things she does, and it's seen as something destructive and even something destructive, though perhaps it's best for her. It can be a cleaning rather than a breakdown. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, all ends in collapse. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which means she argues early on that she has nothing in common with her character, but in a calm but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is the case. <br /> <br The final scene, the climactic performance that shares Myrtle with a character that has been painfully alienated from her acting with her, is one of the most interesting, funniest, hardest, most revealing and enjoyable moments, I've ever seen in a movie movie.
