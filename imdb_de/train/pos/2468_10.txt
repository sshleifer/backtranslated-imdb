I visited Hamlet because I was in between jobs. I figured 4 hours would be great, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the director, the movie role, that made this movie. As in other reviews, the 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for that. When I watch this movie, I constantly try to find flaws, I looked at the fools and did not notice them. How he was able to move the camera into and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was shot in 70 mils. It's a shame that Columbia did not release a widescreen version on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I would take that over Titanic every day. So if you're listening to Columbia, set it up the way it should! And I do not know what happened at the Oscars. This should have the best image, the best actor, the best direction and the best cinematography swept. Which films have you seen? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he paid tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should've taken tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the biggest movies ever.
