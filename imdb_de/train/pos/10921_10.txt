After reading tons of good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it for a rehearsal (I bought it on DVD, hence the word game "Spin" ... I'm an idiot). The beginning was all I had hoped for, a perfect setup (along with some quotes I heard on Various Wu-Tang albums) about a movie that should have been good. But the action I heard was so great, so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except the lizard), I sensed which Venom he was dealing with. In addition, the only cool character is killed in the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot was not very good, but at least there were some good kung fu sounds, right? Not correct. The battles were very short and few and far from each other. Granted, the different styles were all pretty cool, but I wish the fights were longer. I had always hoped to see the lizard running and make a little crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede make a tight, fast race, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. The fight is all pretty routine. Do not be fooled, just because this movie has an action does not mean it's good.
