"Bend It Like Beckham" is a movie that received very little attention here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the film was heavily British in dialogue and terminology, and was heavily involved with football (soccer here), which could cause some coverage for some even in the US. I think the basis of the plot (following a dream) is something that many people can relate to, and in the end "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good movie with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not very excited to see this movie at first, but now I regret that I did not see it earlier. I highly recommend this movie!
