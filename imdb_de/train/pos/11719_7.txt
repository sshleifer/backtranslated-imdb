Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is a funny horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a few times and the jokes often remain below the navel. And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a horror show hostess who learns that she inherited her Aunt Morgana. So she goes to a small town of Fallwell, ruled by the most terrifying monster of all time, embracing Earth: Moral Comedies. Elvira's boobacious appearance is of course too much for the plums, but the children of the city get a kick-start from their other kind of lifestyle. And of course there is more evil evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is looking for magic after Elvira's mother's book. Elvira is a real witch, she just does not know. Yet. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, though the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are also some good visual gags. It's alright all over the place, but never will it be more than that. All in all a good, deliberately combative comedy. If you like that, that's the way it is.
