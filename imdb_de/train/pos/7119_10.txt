My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (aD Major, US Marine Corps) was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese. He also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical advisor to this film, and I hope that he influenced the film by making it look the way it was back then, making it look like real life. My dad is a fanatic of facts and figures, always wanting things to be seen as they were. I would like to believe that he had something to do with it. He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan. For over 40 years married to my mother (ironically, she is Japanese), he received some years ago, one of the highest awards of the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and his activities to bring Kendo and Iaido back to Japan WWII. <br /> <br /> My dad used to be a Marine, but I know that being a Marine always means being a Marine. And that's exactly what he is, and I love and respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie if someone has a copy of it. And I would love to give it to my dad for the 94th birthday of this year!
