Robot Jox does not suffer from story or negative impact. I mean, that was in 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 continued to use the stop animation, like most movies in the 80's. If you look at your biggest blockbusters at this time, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots they had at that time. It was not until the following year that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released, when a breakthrough in technology was realized and storyboarders began using the motif. If you watch this movie you will have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing and even Power Rangers. The enemy robot is very threatening. They do not want to help the man without a really good plan. And there are some great moments in this movie. A traitor / spy works in their midst. Anyone who finds you on your site and supports you could be the person you did not expect. And that is very tedious to think, is not that true?
