This show was a milestone in American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to play a purely African-American cast. Unfortunately, it never aired on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a skyscraper. His father's name is James, he tries to run the house, but his wife Florida is getting better and better. The three children are the artistic JJ, the moody Thelma and the young intellectual child Michael. Florida's gossipy friend Willona always comes into the house. <br /> <br /> I saw two episodes of this show on Youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - the only two on the site). You may be wondering why an English viewer saw a series that has never been heard in his country or that he has barely heard of. The answer is: In 1976, the first black sitcom of Britains with the name "The Fosters" came out. Only two series have been produced that now seem forgotten. But I watched an episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's gossiping friend was Vilma. (To read about the Fosters, I wrote a review about it). In "Good Times" only two things annoyed me. First, the initial theme was (terrible) and second, the laughter of the audience. I like the laughter of the audience, but in that case someone would say something funny and the audience would go crazy and start clapping. Otherwise it was a very funny show. Let's hope there are more episodes on youtube, and let's hope someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Series 1 Episode 6. It was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw Black Jesus was the title of an episode of "The Fosters"
