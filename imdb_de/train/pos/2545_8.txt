The Invisible Ray is an excellent representation of the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff performs immaculately as a grumpy and unruly scientist who seems to be putting his scientific achievements before his relationships with others, even his wife. His already loner personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. Lugosi plays the accomplished professional who is passionate about his work but still has time to have a good time with everyone, but still does not seem to have close friends. This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. However, it is hard to hear his accent and to believe that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science," but in a sense, even junk science works well. Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, today they are as "relevant" as they were when the film was made. And they are also forward and always will be. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely adorable movie that you can watch again and again. I may have seen it five times this weekend and was able to prevail five more times. The spectacle is wonderful and the science amusing. I highly recommend it.
