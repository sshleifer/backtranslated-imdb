I know, that sounds weird of someone born almost 15 years after the program aired, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I like to watch it. I love Adam best. The only disappointing thing is that I could buy the seasons on DVD only in Germany, and that was just the first two seasons. That's disappointing, but that's fine. I will continue to watch online. If anyone has tips on where to buy Season 2 through Season 14, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first. The only downside is that the DVDs come from Germany and are only played on my portable DVD player and my computer. Well. I still own it!
