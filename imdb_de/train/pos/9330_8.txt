"Dangerous Offender" is the story of a seemingly unsocial girl and how she got it. It is based on a true story, and although the monotonous portrayal of the title character and the unbelievable dedication of their lawyer have irritated me, I have to accept that life imitates art, and that there are people out there. <br /> <br /> The film is successful for me because although the character's behavior barely fades to near the end, it gradually becomes sympathetic to her as the film shows how they came to their present state is - what turns out to be self-destructive and not as anti-social. Really a moving movie that brings a lump down your throat when you think about it - which is often the case. <br /> <br /> Despite its many shortcomings (including the fact that it is sometimes hard to observe due to bodily functions and suicide attempts), this is another production that I am proud to call Canadian.
