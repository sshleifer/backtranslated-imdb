Fire And Ice is an animated movie in a fantasy world. The film is about a village destroyed by a huge glacier, home to the evil Ice Lord named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn, who wants to avenge those killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire, and the princess Teegra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn goes in search of her and also goes in search of Nekron. Fire And Ice is led by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us animated masterpieces like the movie version of Fritz The Cat and some movies he wrote himself, like the great movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like Fire And Ice as much as Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still liked the movie. There were some very nice animations and the story was entertaining enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I wish the movie had more story because the story he uses is very thin and does not have a lot of it. I also wish that the movie would be a bit longer because it runs under 80 minutes. Nevertheless, it is a fun action adventure movie that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, is suitable for ages 8 and up. I only wish that there is a more developed story and that it takes a little longer.
