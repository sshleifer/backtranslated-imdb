This remarkable movie is very easy to summarize. First of all, while the comparisons with "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it is almost pointless to do so. While both films combine wit and humor of adults with a fairytale backdrop, "Stardust" is so different from any other fantasy / science fiction movie I've ever seen. It's a mix of these genres, but its plot and script are so unique that the finished product - along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score - is not anything like what's ever been released on the CD Canvas. Second, the score is very effective at the same time to pull us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place, and to drive the story forward, while producing just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to keep the magic within Area credible signs exist. Third, I did not find it so difficult to follow or confuse the movie in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay of the three main negotiations made it even more convincing to watch. Wonderfully busy and excellently traded all along the line. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best I've seen since The King's Return (not that I compare them at all). OK, so it's not so easy to summarize, but do not allow rough and / or heartless and cynical reviews, and the film's pathetic PR does not stop you from taking part in the best time you (or possibly even this summer) in the movies could have in a long time)!
