From the rainy, gloomy late winter England of the early 1920s ... <br /> <br /> --- Where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled veterinarians of the great murder of men and murderers of their female dreams - known as First World War ... Four women share this beautiful little sunny Italian castle on a hill; a young widow drowning out her sorrows at hectic parties, two women rediscovering her own husbands, and a fourth wife who is fed up with her famous, dead friends ... <br /> <br /> ... these Four women will meet, almost blind, with two husbands and a former soldier to get a spiritual "makeover" for a big April holiday in Italy in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> NOTICE for aspiring filmmakers. Study this movie, how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie that could appeal to many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Stock up on coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls on a dull late winter day ... Spring is coming ... The Enchanted April promises you!
