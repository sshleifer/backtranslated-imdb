As I thought of "The Great Escape," I allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a childhood movie. I had read and reread the 1949 autobiographical novel that inspired him, and when it came to the only movie theater (we've never actually used that word) showing "foreign" movies, my turn was my ticket first. <br /> <br /> When someone told war and wartime propaganda films during the Second World War, I had a great interest in exploring the realities of this conflict, as shown in the memoirs and stories of men present in person were . This extended later over the years to the willingness to buy every book on the subject and finally to read the equally compelling novels by Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided for an even deeper sensitivity. The film versions, however, were different than these, as they rarely delivered the goods. <br /> <br /> The medium of black and white film has never been so well served as in those years. I have never seen a Technicolor version of the war that seems as authentic as the deep chiaroscuro of films like The Wooden Horse. If it is true that we are always destined to be caught in the images of our childhood, then I will release it. <br /> <br /> And there will never be anyone else like Leo Genn as the emblematic British war hero on film. Not even Sir Alec.
