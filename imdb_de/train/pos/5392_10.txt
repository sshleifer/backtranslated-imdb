The Waiting Women section of a large recumbent hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where life begins. This almost forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera, full of comedies and tragedies, all involved in the life of the delivery staff and their patients. The openness with which the topic is addressed indicates the pre-code status of the movie. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Aline MacMahon is a sympathetic head nurse, the quiet center of the film, the rock around which flows are all located. She is able to handle any crisis or emergency. She is the best, sometimes the last girlfriend of the mothers. The surrounding MacMahon is a band of excellent costumes: Loretta Young, a convicted killer who has been released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her scared young man; Brassy Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as thoughtful, compassionate physicians and Frank McHugh as a weirdly excited father. <br /> <br /> Filmmates will recognize Bob Watson as a little guy who wants to see the stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as a distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a rotten doctor, who was interested in adopting Farrell's son - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> There are some absurdities in the plot - some mothers are obviously too old; Farrell is obviously getting drunk in the ward, but none of the staff seem to notice. An obviously psychotic patient can wander at will - but this only adds to the bizarre entertainment value of the movie and prevents things from becoming too serious.
