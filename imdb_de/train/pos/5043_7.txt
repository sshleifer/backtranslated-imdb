A promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong, well thought-out horror story about a devout but crazy man in Thurman, Texas, who carries out a murder operation after being commanded by God to eliminate demons trying to control humanity. A few changes of action and a sinister finale make your money worthwhile. But most of the violence you do not really see is enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the twisted man known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the elusive son of the crazy man who tells this story to a Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). As always, Boothe is solid and flawless. Exciting ankle! Highly recommended.
