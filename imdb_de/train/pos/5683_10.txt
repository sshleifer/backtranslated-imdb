Just saying that you have a movie about John Holmes is a guarantee to bring some people to the screen, but the author / director James Cox delivers so much more. As "Rashamon" from the grim Hollywood set, the film splits the Wonderland murders of July 1981 through various angles (and film stocks), but mostly through the filter of John Holmes' petrified weasel brain. In a movie full of bad guys, Holmes is either the meanest, the most miserable, or both. Several versions of the story appear and merge as Cox skips flashes with effects and emotions and twists title cards. The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never sounds wrong. While the film is set to play two years after Holmes's out of pornography and a really evil, drugged depravity, Kilmer relentlessly radiates a sexuality so intense that it can be measured in inches. This sexuality at the edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs almost as strongly as the violence in the center throughout the movie. These murders are reiterated throughout the film, though they are never clearly shown at the climax, though the violence tirelessly permeates the whole picture, spilling lots of blood over walls and photos of crime scenes. Once again, Val Kilmer demonstrates how Holmes shows he can do better than anyone else who works. Kilmer stutters, bends, brags or begs. His character is always a fascinating car accident. In addition to Kilmer belong undoubtedly Ted Levine as a senior police officer in the investigation and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes alienated woman to do so. The trio of criminals, including Holmes, includes the frighteningly high current of Josh Lucas, the ever-interesting Timothy Blake Nelson and an utterly unrecognizable Dylan McDermott in a key role narrator of another version of the murders. Cox says that no matter how much we learn about Wonderland, a worse version is always possible, but to look through the debauchery is far more intriguing than understanding the truth.
