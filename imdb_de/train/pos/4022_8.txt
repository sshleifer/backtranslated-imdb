Another detailed work on this topic by Dr. med. Dwivedi takes us back to the time of the previous Panjab. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult topic for his film debut. He has worked on all the meticulous details to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very sensitive. <br /> <br /> Even if we were not in the area at that time, the sets and costumes look real. Unlike most movies shot on Partition, this one focuses not on the bloody details of violence to attract the audience, but on its aftermath. The figures come alive. Priyanshu Chatterjee has shown an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai has practiced his heart to show the situation of a guilty man. The rest of the cast has also done a good job.
