Since I did not know about this film before I saw it on Rialto Channel, I found it pleasing, poignant and rewarding. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a bit over the top in some places (but that's a movie). The way it looked and took the dizzy ride of the main character until it turned badly, as real life can and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly keen to see this movie once it started, because people joke so often about their acting skills (I find that odd because it's always a solid actress, in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I loved the piece In the end, Andy's character said "Sometimes I feel like he was never here", etc. It was as complete as it really is in such a situation (with me identify myself personally), then there was the beautiful classical piece "Nocturne". I think by Chopin, which was a nice ending (bar in the end the light comedy, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I tell the filmmakers "well done" - I've seen 1,000 worse movies!
