I had seen several days of filming this summer. The end result was only two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the car, stop the car, etc. So this Dakota youth was looking forward to the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd has been singled out, so the shooting scenes were real. (yes Doris, animals were injured during the shoot) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great western / social commentary from the 50s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real Western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for the 50's.
