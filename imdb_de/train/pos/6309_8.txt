I saw this gem from a movie in Cannes where it belonged to the directors for two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is just great. It was great fun and all members of a strong cast are playing their socks. It is a sometimes laughing, loud comedy about a little crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman), who is caught trying to steal a car and sent to jail. In prison, he encounters a "Lifer" telling him of "the ultimate Bellini"? what about you and me ?? is a safe fire rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a passage from an abandoned building to the jewelery shop of the cities. which could bring millions. Sounds easy? ?? Throw in all sorts of crazy characters and incidents on the way and you've got the ingredients for a wild ride! ?? From a low-life loser one word passes to the next, and soon a team is assembled by them to exchange Cosimo 'bellini' at the head of the failed boxer Pero (great played by Sam Rockwell - certainly a star in the making) and reluctant rogue Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby as his wife has been imprisoned for fraud !! <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian movie I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna) Street), which inspired a similar movie to "Collinwood"? "Palookaville". This raises patches of the latter effort, and though written and directed by the Russo brothers, it definitely has shades of the Coen brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who plays a small but funny role as a crippled Safe Breaker.
