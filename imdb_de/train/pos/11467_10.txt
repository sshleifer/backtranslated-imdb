This is the best movie I have met in a long time. This is not just the best movie of its kind (school recordings) The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to film was great. He filmed it with teenagers who were still in high school. He filmed it in the actors' own rooms and used the real parents of the actors as their parents in the movie. The actors also filmed with camcorders, which made it more like a video diary. It's almost artful (if that's indeed a word). However, there are a few slip-ups, for example when Cal brads (?) Calls Land Rover a Range Rover (or vice versa).
