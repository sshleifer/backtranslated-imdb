A community pool in Connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" movie, which is charming, fun, entertaining and engaging. Despite winning prizes at major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released in hordes of theaters across America, but distributed in DVD form and shown selectively in theaters. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that "The Big Bad Swim" never had the marketing hype of a Hollywood release, considering how many sinkers Hollywood HAS released this year, such as "I know who killed me ". "The Big Bad Swim," a really good independent movie, had to swim independently upstream. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the actress Paget Brewster in "The Big Bad Swim" is adorable and believable like Amy. The damn math teacher, who is not only released by her husband, but also loses her job and finally gets involved in a new life. TV soap actor Jeff Branson - who's hot - plays Noah, the serious, vulnerable swimming instructor who takes the time to help his students overcome their fears and discovers that he can learn from his students. The pretty, sexy Jess Weixler (have I just seen her in a banking business?) Skillfully plays Jordan, the future swimmer who does two jobs, one as a pole dancer and the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character is the catalyst for change within the ensemble, but is the least understandable, lacking "background story" or motivation, why she does what she does. Jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous, video-based younger brother who spies on her. However, it is not shown that their parents are involved in their lives in any way, which seems strange. There is no drunken mother or abusive father who explains why a normal, attractive girl from a suburb of Connecticut would choose a self-healing pole dancer who disempower herself for stag parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, "The Big Bad Swim" is largely successful because it's a happy, good movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, learning to swim is the metaphor for life. After all, it's better to jump in with both feet and go for a swim instead of sitting on the deck, because life is going to happen to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is a great date movie, a great dorm movie, a great "something I have not seen", and men like it just like women.
