By no means my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the movie almost totally adorable. Paltrow is doing a good job and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays Miss Bates are all absolutely great. The detail of the period is not alienating; The feeling of the movie is indeed just right. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could not be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K. in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are also no hindrance to enjoyment! Highly recommended. AnaR
