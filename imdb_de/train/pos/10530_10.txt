What an enchanting movie ... <br /> <br /> This film is accompanied by Oscar-winning RACHEL PORTMAN's lush, emotional and dreamy music and remains a true pleasure more than once a year. Incredible casting ... <br / > <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was fascinating to look at, sitting on the edge of the seat, hanging on to every word and laughing hysterically with her. One of the loveliest characters I have met for a long time. From one of the opening scenes, when she thanked Mr. Woodhouse for saying "the beautiful quarter behind pork ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" She screams at her daffodil and clearly hearing-impaired mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who looks abandoned and lost. <br /> <br /> The weird ways that Emma spits on the scratching Miss Bates saves her from having a really angry picnic scene when Emma insults Miss Bates, who punches her savage dig into her heart. Then we see the poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears. And you can not be so depressed as to feel her heart being torn out for her. It's a classic scene to wrap around and play over and over ... <br /> <br /> The ending ends with "sense & sensibility" and one of the biggest lessons in life about how to marry one of his best friends ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will thrill you as much as I do myself. <br /> <br /> I loved him!
