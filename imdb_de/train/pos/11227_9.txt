Hidden Frontiers - more than a fan fiction - it's a thoughtful and organized series that keeps the worlds of Star Trek alive and growing. From a funny little fan project to a well-known network series; Hidden Frontiers has something for every Star Trek fan. Set in the late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager timelines Hidden Frontier deals with issues and issues posed in other Star Trek series, with set stories using well-developed characters, plots, and story sheets. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken up stories from the social context that Gene Roddenberry has not brought to the screen, and demonstrated the evolution of characters in long-term space assignments - the true things that happen in close proximity, as well as exciting spatial wars and conflicts -Fi Knowing and loving addicts. Done in a "Green Screen" studio; Hidden Frontiers brings a boisterous cast of regulars to the screen and into your hearts. The large ensemble of actors plays well together and lovingly gives the project time and energy. The inventive use of green screen technology, props, make-up and costumes make the Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and believable. Hidden Frontier has gone into the world of science fiction, where few go, and prospered when they arrived there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a thoughtful website with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. I strongly recommend that you take the time to download and watch.
