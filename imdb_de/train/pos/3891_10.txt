One of the best comedians of all time. I have seen this show about 10 times and will probably see at least 100 more. My friends and family quote this DVD so many times that you think we've done nothing but watch them. The opening part of Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either go through or go over to the part where Eddie is on stage. Pay attention to the part "Cake or Death" (joke about the Church of England) and the part "Hitler / Pol Pot" (difficult to explain, just look at). Perhaps the best thing about the show is Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, right?) Fair Warning: Eddie tends to throw in many four-letter words.
