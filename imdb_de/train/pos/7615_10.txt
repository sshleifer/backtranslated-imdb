This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest shows ever seen on television. I mean, the spectacle is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything and with such a simple story: A plane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor he is. Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is weird, I could go on. The unexpected storyline revolves too, the characters' backstories, the music that stands at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proven what an excellent writer and producer he is. I mean, that's better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who does not watch this show should definitely consider getting the DVDs and watching because they are missing something big. This show could be the best show in TV history !!
