That is so exciting! After watching "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted little movie, I think this movie is a real treat! This is absolutely adorable and one of the most beautiful pictures I have seen this year. This is even more amazing as it is an early talkie and shames some of the great images from the 1930s due to the innovative use of sound in the cinema. It's just full of music and a delightful mood that's really optimistic, and in the end it made me happy! Of course, it's not so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for, but the tempo is so exciting and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I did not think twice about it. The comedy is often funny and I think it is even superior to the Marx brothers, possibly the greatest comic force of the time. That's pretty perfect.
