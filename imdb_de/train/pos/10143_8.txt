This was a great episode, one of the best of the two seasons. The right horror for a change, with a story far beyond the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. In a tragic car accident in which he drove, the wife of a man is almost burned. His airbag worked, it did not work. She is burned beyond recognition (great make-up, by the way) and has no big chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she is constantly dying, but is brought back by modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her mind appears as a very vengeful mind. Of course, it comes to slaughter and some extremely bloody killings and extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask, could you ask? Well, not much, because this baby has everything and a very satirical ending, which gives most spectators a smile. I also loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction, he has a big knack for horror. Excellent result, this I buy with security.
