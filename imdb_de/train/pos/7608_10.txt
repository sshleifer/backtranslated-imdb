I eagerly looked at the first series, but wondered if I would return there after a long break. However, I chose episode one of Series 2 and was totally thrilled again. This is really an excellent TV. groundbreaking stuff like Mission: Impossible in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and expand throughout the series. They change when they adapt to their new environment - some more than others - but they remain adept in character and it is quite possible to have sympathy for someone you did not think you could ever apologize to when something really annihilating happens to them. I hope there will be many years of "Lost" that I can rejoice in - and I really do not mind if I never get answers to all the secrets!
