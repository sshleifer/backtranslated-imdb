I borrowed this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for a stupid 1950s sci-fi Asco and because it's the first feature-length long-film Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I was very dedicated and very pleasantly surprised. An experimental oil well has penetrated the earth for about six kilometers and is being decommissioned by the sponsor. Lois and Clark appear to get the shovel, but are disappointed that the deepest hole ever drilled will be out of service. One day later, strange events at the Well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than for Clark Kent. It appears that the radioactive mole Men have invaded their six-mile-deep home near the Earth's core. Supermen and the Mole Men is a simple but well-made social realism. Published in 1951, with a leading actor serving in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anyone else. To bring this point home in a typical, straightforward, superhuman way, Reeves even blames the lynch mob who chased Mole Men to be a Nazi. <br /> <br /> Even in the fifties, science was nonexistent on this film. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust would not have penetrated even the top mantle, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which certainly does not exist. Forgettable - keep in mind that this movie is based on a comic from the Golden Age. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit uneven. Although the molems are interesting, a bit scary and pretty, there are several Corman scenes that take too much time to show us their strange behavior. The script is smart and economical. By today's standards, costuming is bad to fair, but at the time, the special effects and costumes of this movie were pretty good. Cinematography is also generally very good and the drama is much better than you might expect. I was particularly impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
