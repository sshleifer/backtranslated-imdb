I thought King Solomon's Mines was beautiful. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was great, but her make-up and hair were not out of that time and always seemed to be looking for them alongside the other actors. I found Patrick Swayze an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an experienced, robust actor in that role after film-for-movie sat with fair-haired fair-skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt and so on. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version is not comparable to the 1950 version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains would be credible, but the two media have to stay separate. I am looking forward to seeing this again, and I hope that Patrick Swayze will return to this kind of role.
