Steve Carell's mission is to portray the weird straight guy, first in The Daily Show and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and witty script that brings out his strengths to perfection. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who leads a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a bit funny, but in a clumsy nice way. One night, when Andy first met his colleagues, Andy accidentally reveals he's a virgin. His colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) first tend to Andy about his situation. However, it is clear that all three have some respect for the decent person Andy is, and they decide to support him by helping him to end his virginity. And so Andy's search for adulthood begins. Andy is the epitome of the innocent, and much of the humor is based on his naivety of the situations he finds throughout the movie. Part of the humor is rough, rough stuff, but most of it is just a good, intelligent comedy. In addition, I actually found some parts of the film very touching, as maybe for the first time in his life Andy develops both romantic relationships and friendships. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or drama. It's a rolling comedy on her seats. Still, every good comedy I've ever seen has enough heart to take care of the characters. A good comparison would be "The Wedding Crashers" earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar sense of humor, but may be a bit more vulgar in some jokes. I especially loved the end of the movie, which in my opinion was the perfect way to end the movie. Without revealing anything, it reminded me of "Something about Mary". Very easy and funny; They laugh and smile, and that's how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend it.
