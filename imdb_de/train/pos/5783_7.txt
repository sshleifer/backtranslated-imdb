I've read reviews from Kerching on IMDb, and honestly I have not seen a positive review so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenager named Taj Lewis. To raise Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother, he sets up a website called Rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things, with only Taj and his two friends - Danny and Seymour - able to prevent Taj from being abandoned. I think this show is pretty funny and I like to watch it. The acting is OK, but it can definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity makes him funny. and Taj's other friend Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the cafe, called "The Chill". We never see him, we only hear him. Taj's younger brother Omar and his older sister Missy are also funny. And Missy's best friend Kareesha. So many times Taj's was almost abandoned. In addition to the comedy, the drama in Kerching, such as the love life and loss of loved ones, makes this program great.
