This is one of the most soothing, relaxing and beautiful animated films I have ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, you can feel like the movie with the sounds and music! This movie is not only suitable for children, but also for adults. You learn how to never forget who you are. You can do anything you call yourself courageous and courageous. This movie can make you cry sometimes, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the seat edge! Some movies really give you a blurry feeling after you've seen them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my rating of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of spirit!
