The Road Rovers were a great show about dog superheroes that the master had selected for fighting crime around the world. The show was hilarious, to say the least. Simple and complex jokes suitable for all ages. Run jokes throughout the series that could provoke a drinking game. The action was hypnotic and clever. The characters were very original and each had a different personality. But what pleased me most about the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but are contained in the subtext. Hopefully one day there will be a way to see the Rovers in action.
