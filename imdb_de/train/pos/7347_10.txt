I own Ralph Bakshi's forgotten masterpiece Fire & Ice on an old OOP rental video. <br /> <br /> Well, that's better than any other Conan-like movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? Time has stood the test of time, and the only way to look cheesy is to compare it to modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (though I love this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot looks like this: After In a fight between Fire & Ice, a princess is abducted by underground creatures of Jarols (Ice), while a single survivor of a victim-enlightened village rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it does not sound like a nurse Betty, but that's not the point. It's really an interesting idea to create a world with two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> As for the action scenes: great. They are well managed, have awesome suspension and lots of loud noise. Take a look at the climate battle, this is the end! <br /> <br /> The acting and the dialogue: competent. Really. They are not nominated for an Oscar, but they are fine and will not annoy you. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Turned on 3D and rotoscoped (I THINK) it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look very detailed and well-drawn, and although the character designs feel a bit one-dimensional, they are fine. All in all, this is a fine, neglected little gem that will entertain you more than a superficial "conversation." 10/10
