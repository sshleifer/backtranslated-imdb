I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not even sure what exactly is, but I think it's wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers, yet they came out well enough to spend their time at the villa in Italy. The actors have done a great job in my opinion. The characters were all so different and yet a clever story that worked. There are problems with humor, drama and relationships in good time. This requires 10 lines, but I can not say anything more, so I'll just rattle until I get 10 lines. So excuse me. What else can I say, it's been a long time since I last saw it. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, but it's not available.
