Some people have stated that since the eleventh season, South Park has begun a trend to leave its politically biting satire for flat parodies; However, this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode misleads the Living Dead series, there is more. It is a satire of how people deal with the homeless. Characters say things like "pretending to be just like us" or "you want to be human." This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the underclass and often just give up their luck. <br /> <br /> So it's still a satire and also a wonderful parody. What do you want more?
