When I was six, I heard about a series called "Los Campeones", and even when I was a kid, I did everything I could to convince my parents to give me "The Champions" once a week. and watched "The Avengers". I think that was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already own the complete cycle of The Prisoner!), But it also took a few years later with The Tomorrow People, The Worst Witch I'm only myself), or that's "Harry Potter" with girls, of course, before I want to be "The Campions" in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (the whole series packs a bunch of uhm , maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more on that 8) "People of Tomorrow" and some other "low budget", but there are great stories available in my reached zones that speak and understand English but not all of my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope somebody could feel the pull of this series and then sell it the way I originally thought. Dubbed or with subtitles, but in the same format I have seen them. Remember that zone 1 or 4 are ok with my TV!
