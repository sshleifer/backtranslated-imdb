I've seen the movie twice within a week, both times in a movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was full both times and the people had to be turned away. Since the beginning of the film, when Henry Winkler was "injured" on the football field, the entire audience was laughing, the laughter that lasted until the final credits were in turmoil. For those who love American wrestling, this movie is a must, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler as you've never seen him before. Look out for a well-known actor whose trademark in wrestling is head-but-head! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, watch this movie and it's the finest family comedy entertainment!
