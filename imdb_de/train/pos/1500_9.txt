Nowadays, most people do not see classic movies like these. Most friends only watch movies from the 90s. That's kind of stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old films of this kind are masterpieces that are unique in their own way. Just because back then, when these movies were thought of and made, that was when ideas were fresh. Now people just have to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> At least for the movie. For real fans of the classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator investigating the disappearance of a movie actor and stumbles over three more strange events with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say more because I'm going to ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a great movie for as old as it is. And would like to see it again!
