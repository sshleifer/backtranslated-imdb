Cuba Gooding Jr., stars of the legendary Navy Diver, Carl Brashear, who defied the navy of a man to become the first African American Navy Diver. Sometimes at his side and sometimes at his opponent was a man whom Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday. Sunday was in many ways crowded, aggravating and helping Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His portrayal here is as liberating and powerful as Denzel Washington's in Hurricane. In every scene we see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the fight in him as he sets off to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and strained some of the important dive scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heartfelt and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I could see would have to be plaster cast. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very complicated and exciting. This makes you a bit sad when they have to hit heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters. The evil lieutenant Cmdr. Hanks, Charlotte Theron, the eccentric colonel of the diving school (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba's love interest are the characters I did not find much depth in. What could have made these characters more substantial and effective was more time to develop them. Why was this colonel always in his tower? How was it that the woman was so bitter and always drunk on Sunday? Another question has to be this one. What happened to the wedding of Carl Brashear? I mean, if this movie records the life of this man, would not his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. The men of honor, however, are a perfect example of the triumph and faith that surrounds the human mind. This movie will inspire you and make you feel this man's fight. What I believe was the reason why this powerful story was told. My hat goes to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
