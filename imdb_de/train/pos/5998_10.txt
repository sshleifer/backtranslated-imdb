The Cure is an amazing movie ... so exciting and simply REAL! I was fortunate to see a screening of "The Cure" at the premiere in New York, which blew me away! I also heard that it got a prize from this festival and it definitely deserves it. The first thing I noticed was cinematography. Eric Giovon did a great job. The turning style of the love scene in the middle of the film was amazing. A love scene was needed in this film, and Jafri conveyed the meaning and also kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri form an outstanding creative team and should work together on future projects. Judy Maier's story was so surreal, but at the same time heartbreaking, made me feel what the main character felt. I'm a very strict critic, but I have to say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies. JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen it yet, look at it!
