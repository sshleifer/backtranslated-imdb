Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling of missing something. Ever since he missed a decisive baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he was convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that shot. Then one night his car breaks down again. Larry goes to the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck and meets bartender Mike, who, without knowing Larry, will change his life forever. The movie is not news, it goes back to It's A Wonderful Life and shows nothing Signs that it's waning with Click's latest Sandler vehicle. It's a genre that has produced very mixed results. In 1990, this James Belushi production was performed, which was seldom mentioned when the subject appeared, it seems as if it had been largely forgotten. What a pity, because it exudes charm and is not too short in the humor department. We know that, in the end, we will be guided to its ultimate message, but it is an entertaining and enjoyable way to be guided down. The film also shows what a good comedy James Belushi was. I mean, if his style of clever quipping and blasphemy of anger is not your thing? Then you could avoid this movie anyway. But for those who work with people like Red Heat, K-9, and Taking Care of Business, Mr. Destiny is right in your street. They include Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny, pure escapism fun with a kicker of a message in the heart. 10.7
