This is not a bad movie. It's not wild weird, but it's interesting and entertaining. It has a few funny moments. Cher offers a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role that is very close to her true life. But their <br /> <br /> performance is worth the time. If this movie had come out today, he would not have been nominated, but after the 80s, he was excellent.
