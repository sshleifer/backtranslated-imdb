SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre "Hell are other people". In "The Odd Couple" Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau show how exactly this can be. As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau found two good friends who decide to live together. As the two slowly get more and more frustrated, the laughter comes quickly and hard, before Felix leaves and Oscar leaves a changed and cleaner personality. Jack Lemmon as a Hungarian is absolutely gorgeous as a neurotic, cleanse-divorced, coping with the life of a single man. Walter Matthau, in contrast to Lemmon's character, is as good as the sloppy sports writer who just wants to play poker to earn money for his child support. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are great in their chosen areas, depending on Neil Simon's beautiful script, and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are inherently different in their lifestyle, albeit similar in relationship to former wives and children, these two great, late actors form a partnership whose reintroduction is virtually impossible. So big that the world screamed so much for something like that, that two years before Matthaus's death and three before Lemmons the characters were reunited in an inferior order. This idea, though it followed Hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, may have worked out to some extent, but at the same time it could never come close to the genius of this original film. After all, it's not really the case to really say anything else. With Simon's amazing script, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this movie were already a hit. However, the casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which has even taken its toll in "The Simpsons"), its excellent script and its brilliant leading men, is a tribute to the cinema and a feature that history can remember ,
