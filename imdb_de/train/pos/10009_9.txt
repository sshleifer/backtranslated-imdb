When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was loved by the human drama that Gabriel Niem and those who interest him. Nevertheless, we have now received the film version of an excellent story and it is expected to leave the glamor of Hollywood behind ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner really made it! <br /> <br /> With the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with confidence issues both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> When we get to know the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems, and that the smallest event can irrevocably change our lives. The request to review a book written by a young man becomes a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to continue and move forward. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that most people avoid this movie. I'm just saying that because the average American will probably think, "Robin Williams in a serious role? That did not work before!" Please give this movie a chance! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all find and have to go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his film One Hour Photo, he has developed as an actor and created another quality work of art. Oh, and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale steals every scene he's in. He has it the leading man of the 1940s and screen presence. It's this clinging opinion that he could wear his own movie now! <br /> <br /> S ~
