When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in resistance in this film, my expectations were low that I would watch the entire movie. The only reason I gave him a chance was the great Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. What I took for a broad "Mrs. Doubtfire" farce turned out to be a gentle and softly revealing comedy. Pasdar is utterly credible and empathetic as an ambitious businessman who needs to release the female part of his being through cross-dressing. He transmits these needs in an absolutely credible way to the public. Julie Walters is great, as is her habit, like the landlady, who teaches him unconditional love.
