I really enjoyed this show. Even as a teenager, I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. It has always been difficult to create a series based on race corruption, while at the same time allowing the racetracks to record filming on this controversial topic. One episode that I remember well was a horse that was expected to win a big race that looked a bit nondescript. An injection was found on the stable floor, and everyone thought it had been drugged, but nothing was reported on the blood tests. Too late, they realized that the horse was not endowed, but the knee cartilage had been removed. As if running a car without oil and the engine seized up, the horse collapsed with tragic consequences.
