These first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and had a dramatic element where Bill (the mother) struggled with all the usual problems of life, but this element was a bit depressing and mingled not good with the comedy elements, which is why it was probably dropped. It soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC ever did! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's characters was very funny and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas specials were funny and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show ended when actor Gary Olsen, who played Bill, passed away, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP < Unfortunately, this underrated show has disappeared from our television screens and is not repeated that often - though it occasionally appears on UKTV Gold, it should be seen in BBC one or two this ingenious comedy to a new audience
