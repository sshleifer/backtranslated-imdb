Of all the Princess stories that Disney has released there, Cinderella probably has the most lasting appeal. I can not really say why, but for some reason generation after generation puts them at the top of their lists. As a little girl I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper - it was my absolute favorite costume the human heart as Cinderella. Who never wanted to flee from the strains of everyday life and find someone who sees you like no one else has? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still sounds right. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the characters, Disney, if nothing else, can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is angry for the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not obviously physical way. Her sharp tongue and eyes do the work for her - she does not need reconnaissance rods to put fear in her heart. Animal lovers tend to eat, especially this idiotic Gus. I would have cheered if he had met his fate in Lucifer's jaw. Cinderella herself was not a weakling, who sometimes rightly made some bold comments. But she just lacked the urge to make her completely sympathetic. Sure, she was nice and fed animals, but what did she think about that place? We never know. Even if she only became a housemaid in another house, she is at least paid and has respect. It seems that the only reason things end up working for Cindy is that everything falls into her lap. She never works for her dreams, which she loves to sing about. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the music that is beautiful as always. Ilene Woods has a beautiful, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great standards were born here - a dream is a wish your heart makes, so this is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful, heartfelt story with a lot of musical highlights. Although it lacks some character development, it does offer some classic villains and excellent language work. If you feel sick in the heart, warm it up, it will warm you up and make you drone. Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Movie's quote: <br /> <br /> - Surprise! Surprise! -Du duh-Happy Birthday!
