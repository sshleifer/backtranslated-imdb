Director Otto Preminger unites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble movie noir: Where The Sidewalk ends. This movie features well-written crime thrillers with interesting characters, unexpected twists and nifty dialogues, as well as a responsive look with great camera movement and dark and gloomy film noir lighting. Dana Andrews plays the lead role as Detective Mark Dixon, part-gangster and part-policeman, reputed to be physically too criminal. After a case sees Dixon looking for suspects and answers, he is far more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in his role - hard and nervous, Andrews Dixon is ready to beat everything when he comes on his bad side. He's the perfect movie noir anti-hero - he's not always very nice, but we still found him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role and is a sweet shoulder to Dixon. Tierney's role may not mean too much, but she certainly surpassed what others might do with that role, and opened up every audience with her friendly smile, her gentle manner, and her wink. The side cast is not bad either - Karl Malden is the most memorable, who enters as Lieutenant Thomas and does a good side job. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not a Laura, but it's a great movie noir filled with great characters, stories, and pictures.
