Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this fun and funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with Grandpa (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is funny as the owner of a wax museum, in which a whole department of the Munster family is dedicated. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa terrorize the city, they accuse both of them. They must now clear their names before it's too late. You will laugh as loud as me.
