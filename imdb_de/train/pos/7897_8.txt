At first glance, this movie does not look very good. After all, a Bette Davis movie with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 is rather bad. However, the movie turned out to be a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> One would initially expect this to be a normal average 30s movie with a formulaic love story, but the film is surprisingly well constructed with an unusual and original story that also helps make this movie very enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is borne by her two protagonists, played by Bette Davis and George Brent. You helped with a cast of mostly amusing characters, but the movie mainly includes only two. Her character is involved in an extremely unusual and clever love story that also looks humorous. It makes this movie a delightful little comedy that is perfect to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty short (just an hour long), which means that the story wastes no time with unnecessary overhead, plotting, developing and characters. It also makes the movie pretty fast, which helps make this film perfect even by today's standards. It sometimes makes the movie a little simplistic, but this is never at the expense of its entertainment or its fun. <br /> <br /> A delightful, pleasant, simple romance comedy that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
