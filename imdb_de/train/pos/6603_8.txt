I have to mention two failures to understand that this film did well where it failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were enthusiastic about the concepts of these two films and felt deeply disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy a renaissance. It immerses you in the world of a future Paris. It is not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped, but what I can say was not, it was just movement. The facial expressions are incredible! I have not seen a fantasy world since TRON, which is so well represented in an animation / live hybrid. The medium black and white is used to draw your attention slowly to the subject of the scene. My favorite effect was what they did with headlamps, watch out. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are finally happy to find the thread you are looking for. The overall effect is a rough and rough urban world full of little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but not terrible. It's Noir-ish. For most of the main characters, there is a back story that gives them some depth. It's the weather There are "sets" so you can feel different places in Paris. There is some action and even a chase. I'll have to see these again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to display, as the sets are detailed and the credits are small.
