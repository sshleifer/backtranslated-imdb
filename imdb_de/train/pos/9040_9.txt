A truly healing American story about teenagers interested in starting their own rocket in a rural coal mining town in West Virginia after Sputnik's inauguration in 1957 is ultimately able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is an excellent title role as leader of the group. As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her southern accent is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There is an outstanding performance from Chris Cooper, a miner who wants his son to follow him, but gradually appears at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so unusual for our time is that there are no bedtime scenes and no insanity. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done. In addition to the scientific aspect, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of the family. <br /> <br /> Why are images of this type no longer recognized at award times?
