Okay, I'm now a long way from Houston, but when I see this movie, I'm brought back to a little Cowgirl's dream to one day ride the bull at Gilley's. (It burned before I drank.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, you know that this movie is an accurate representation of today's life at that time. If you have not, trust me and watch the movie. Either you will join the many who love it (and at the same time are strangely repelled), or you can at least make fun of the red necks. (There's a lot of stuff to poke.) This movie does not try to teach P.C. (What was that in the 80's) or hide the white trash element and it's honest with time and place. <br /> <br /> Must be a 10 for me!
