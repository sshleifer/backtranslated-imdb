This is a great movie from the lost age of a reactionary television drama. My favorite actor of all time, Robert Culp, is cleverly characterized by a straightforward liberal sincerity and belief in the system, by conservative knees and crime anxiety, and by murder psychosis. The teenagers are a collection of pure scornful evil stereotypes, and the final message of this movie makes Dragnet's episodes seem indifferent by comparison. What really shines is the great speed of the film, which gradually builds the fear and paranoia, as well as the feeling of the entire Californian backdrop. The cars are really great, as I remember. I give this movie a 10, and I challenge everyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's done for television does not mean that it's not great art.
