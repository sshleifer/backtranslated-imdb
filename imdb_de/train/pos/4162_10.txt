Yes, it is. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 of all the favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm not usually into plots, but I think plots work better in anime and RPG video games (like Final Fantasy 7), not in movies. But this one has everything. Lively drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written script. While not really intended for children, this is still something they can see, it does not contain graphic blood, guts and silicone. But I do not think they will understand.
