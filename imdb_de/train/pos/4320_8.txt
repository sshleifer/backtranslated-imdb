This highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing in a movie should be. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder. The film is about the divisions people create to protect themselves from everyday violence, hatred and bigotry. <br /> <br /> On the way, questions are asked about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a great beard) wonders, "Do I make a violent film (and our joy in it) that causes violence in society?" Claire asks, "What kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks, "Is it possible to cross the boundaries of the race and fund (an even more difficult step)?" These are of course not quoted from the movie, but general questions. Others also ask their questions and frankly it is more than it answers. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life: we strive to find life-long answers to questions that we will never fully answer, and in certain cases have to find answers to our own needs and desires : As people we have questions that we can not answer. Some answers are real. Claire and Mack state that although they could take the easy route and let the state take over the baby, their finding responsibility for this carries their lives in hand, some answers do not: Davis's 'Sees the Light' and concludes, not violent ones Turning films, but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art. <br /> <br /> We are all looking for answers This film does not answer them, it only reminds you to continue to search the answers. <br /> <br />
