This film tells the story of a romance between a niece of Albert Einstien and a gas station attendant. To bring the two together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins of Hudsucker Proxies) act smarter. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Joy follows. Not to miss. Filmed in Mercer County New Jersey at Princeton University, the Lawrenceville Prep School (doubling for Princeton University) and a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell.
