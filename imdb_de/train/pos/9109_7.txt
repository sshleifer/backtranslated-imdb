Essentially, it is the story of two men involved in the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but usually directors go back to a historical fact to talk about something else, or they also show the time before or after that fact. Everything happens here in the days when the revolution works. It can also be considered as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two characters and shows that they were normal, not like normal heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although the title is military, you can understand that the main characters are "Captain". Beautiful colors and lights throughout the movie, excellent work for the director as her first film, she does not fall in a banal way. Well-displayed emotions and passion of people and people. The character of Maia (main character) is well done, and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, who can show Maia's limits, as this is not a hero.
