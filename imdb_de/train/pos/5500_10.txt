This documentary (now available for free at Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone has to see that. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in 1998 in a landslide vote. His platform was to redirect the fantastic oil wealth from the 20% middle class to the 80% poor. He prohibited foreign driftnet fishing in the waters of Venezuela. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. He has eradicated illiteracy and founded new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on the profits of the oil companies that got him in trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, when Irish filmmakers interviewed Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain Chavez at the Presidential Palace about his social programs, a CIA-backed coup started. As the cameras rolled, Chavez was captured and flown out of the country. National television announced that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to millions in the palace and demanded the return of Chavez. In the face of these overwhelming numbers, the military hired the coup leaders, and the conspirators fled to the US. Chavez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to cheers.
