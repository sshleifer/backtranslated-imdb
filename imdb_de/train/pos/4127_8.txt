I know that there are some purists who give something poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo what is not exactly the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it's similar to the Japanese version, but it does justice to the American spirit at the same time. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with flair. The iron cooks themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs in the world at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American iron chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun cooking, commenting and peculiarities of creating. I watched the show and I think all players work well together. However, the judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, such as the lawyer who became a gourmet, but most judges are questionable when it comes to dealing with the food they offer. I enjoy it when the cooks jostle and surprise the challengers. The food at the end always looks great and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe that is all that anyone can ask to really want to eat what is served. The only thing I really would like to do about the show is to ask people on the show to brighten up a bit. Sometimes the mood gets a bit tense and it's no fun to look at them for more entertainment. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was as exaggerated as the original, but I can say that it was a pretty expensive proposition. I wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, I would grin for an hour. As long as you can not count on the original Japanese version and accept this series on its own, it can be an enjoyable hour.
