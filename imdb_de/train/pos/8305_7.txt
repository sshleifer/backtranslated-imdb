I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not know that Little Richard had so many things in his life. First of all, Lucille was unaware of me. There is very little (almost no) mention of women closely associated with Little Richard. Even in his life today, there is no romantic involvement of women. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the movie was great. I did not like it when Leon played Little Richard, he's a good actor, but I feel like another actor's role should have been. Visually, he did not remind me of Little Richard. I was also completely ignorant of the promiscuity Little Richard belonged to. From the movie he was portrayed as sexually addicted. At the present time, he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I do not want to ruin the movie for someone who has not seen the movie. However, there were some things in the movie that I think should not have been part of the Final Cut.
