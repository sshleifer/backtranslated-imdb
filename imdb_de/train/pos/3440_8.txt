Dear Rosario Dawson, think she is one of the best actresses of modern times. <br /> <br /> Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. It is the consistent keynote in everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the characters intentionally bland and one-sided. The only consequence is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's path from self-empowerment to the loss of empowerment and back again. <br /> <br /> It's not appropriate to call this a rape classic. So many people do not like the movie. The usual "rape audience" does not like this movie very much, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it confronts its target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience, and although the film does not strike the audience with self-righteous audacity, it attracts the viewer for all sorts of wrong reasons. > <br /> Descent is a good movie that IMHO has greatly undervalued.
