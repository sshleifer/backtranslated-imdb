I am amazed that films like these can still be made. I constantly watch all kinds of movies with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. I never thought that a 146-minute movie could make me think about it over and over again. <br/> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a washed-up ex-terrorist agent to whom he has pledged the bottle. Once he's tasked with protecting the young pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive bow begins in the way that only a delightful little girl can offer. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to hold the teddy bear in his hand holding the teddy bear. Yes, he has become a man in flames. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie.
