Good luck if you even watch this movie - it's not released on tape or DVD yet. I saw it in the early '70s, lucky enough to get it through the efforts of the American Cinematheque, and there are still some tangible moments that have remained with me for thirty years. No reason to repeat the exact comments from Rwint here. As a noteworthy director shortly after the rapid success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N has mastered the low budget effort as well as possible. This is certainly evident in hiking and meandering that a re-cutting would have been necessary. But it is also a memorable symbol of the times: the very intense clashes with college sports of the late '60s, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why watch this movie? In some scenes it was probably a groundbreaking man: the playful male bond in the showers after the game; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you off guard - but it's the first use of a word I've never seen in the movie. and the random and unexpected use of nudity altogether. There are probably others that I leave out. <br /> <br /> Looking for a nice surprise for a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a thin David Ogend Taurus; Mike Warren, fresh from his powder blue UCLA uniform, prepares for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - actor; and a lot of people just play themselves. <br /> <br /> Well: Any connection between Harry Gitte's last name Robert Towne and a particular character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> It receives a "7" based on Karen Black. You will see why.
