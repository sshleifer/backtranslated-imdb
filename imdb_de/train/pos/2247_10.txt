I am disappointed with the lack of contributions to this surprising and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow", writes and directs stars. <br /> <br /> I will not award any plot points as a movie (at least for me)) was very exciting not knowing anything about it. If you have a Netflix account or have access to a video library that could carry it, I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, funny and sometimes very thoughtful creation. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is * pretty * impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with amazing images and a great lead performance spoken in Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is an amazing movie that you can show your friends. <br /> <br /> LAKE IT.
