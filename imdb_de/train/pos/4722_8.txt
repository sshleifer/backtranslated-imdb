Given the low budget and production restrictions, this film is very good. It is plausible, realistic, and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian riders who lived in the prairie) risked their lives to save a defeated American pilot from the reckless and wild Nazis. A daring boy who admires the American pilot: If you're looking for special effects, Superman heroes, and magic endings, this movie is not for you. If you want to feel that evading the movie must have been stubborn, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you'll love this movie. I really enjoyed it will be one that you will remember for a long time.
