In this film, the plight of an ALS patient (Lou Gehrig's disease) is excellently presented. The subject is treated with compassion as well as humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as an ALS employee that I could hardly believe she was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, an outstanding actor, lives up to expectations, as the quirky artist who misbehaves must accompany Helena's character as part of his "civil service," an alternative to jail time. Watching the evolution of the relationship between these two is a pleasure from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairytale does not affect the fabulous performances. You come to both of them deeply.
