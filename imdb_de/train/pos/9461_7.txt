Steve Carell plays a starring role as a person with whom you can get in touch with Dan (a kind of guy) in real life, a movie that I expected he did not like, but eventually liked. Not that the movie would laugh out loud, just that he has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what The Office fans would expect, but you know what I liked, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays Dan Burns, a widowed dad whose daughters do not really like him. One weekend, he and his daughters travel down to see his family. There he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns to his house, he learns that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). Dan in real life, I found sometimes a bit unbelievable. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together, play board games and do a number of other family things? I would doubt that very much. I do not know a family that is like this. Does that stop me from leaving it to me? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
