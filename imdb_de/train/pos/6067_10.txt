Although I'm inclined to agree to the other comments from people who watched this movie, I'm ashamed to say that I like it more. It's not often that you can find such a huge pile of '80s daddy outside a wham! Video, so it's definitely worth a visit (0.79 â‚¬ per night in my shop!). Watch out for the amazingly obvious seams and zippers on the monster's costume, the fact that the "hero" looks very much like Keith Chegwin, and such classic lines as the following: The evil wizard-type Bloke: "Finally we meet Cor .. . "Kor:" Exciting, is not it? "<br /> <br /> Amazing !! I also like the fact that the video box looks pretty exciting with pictures of a castle surrounded by a roaring sea and a dangerous hawk. Like a bird taking a good-looking hero to safety (including such "interesting and appealing" suggestions as what's going on in the movie, none of them actually happens.) No, I'm not joking ... there's really no sea or rage a wild bird, it's just an attempt to interest you ... classics in my opinion. This movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
