What a great movie! This is reminiscent of the wonderful Disney family movies of the 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised after the last 20 years of absolute Detritus Disney's live production crews came out. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. The child stars were just that; professional, quality actor. I am most impressed by the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was a total Sykophantian who introduced the exaggeration and held a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I will not recant the story here, as there is little point in doing so again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was great! This work reminds you what it's like to be a kid without being angry or being too grim. The deleted scenes in the DVD version were deleted the best. They were too hard for this movie and would have taken so much of it. While the abuse in the finished product was hinted at, it has not been shown to some degree. It was best that way. <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely adorable movie. <br /> <br /> It gets a 9/10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
