really excellent movie, one of the best I have ever seen. Touching and easy - just like life, sometimes you sometimes cry and you laugh and it's just beautiful. not too much of anything, as it should be. The idea of ​​the movie was really excited. No one is bad or good, all or just people. Sometimes they make mistakes, mainly because of the pressure of society. Everyone tries to stay strong, and some are more successful than others. The important thing is that you do not have reasons to get angry - you can do it, but eventually the anger goes away and you have to bring the love back, even if it's hard, then there is true happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and actors, the movie really gets you in the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> nice nice nice. <br /> <br /> I recommend to see him, especially if you like to see the life of the Italians. ,
