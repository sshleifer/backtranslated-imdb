As is known among long-haired teenagers who are unbelievably interested in Mr. Graf's dumb jokes, summer aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and prestigious places to escape the heat, as well as hordes of rough people who calm down. Such bizarre journeys around the world also take place in "Three Ages," a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old people, namely, Mr. Buster Keaton and Mr. Eddie Cline. Obviously, this German count liked most The first section focused on the Stone Age because of the affinity this aristocrat has for this ancient time. to prefer that to the second section, which takes place during the glory of Rome (it should have contained the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, ie barbarians or the same German). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that himself should qualify as modern 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> The leitmotiv that motivates Mr. Keaton and his companions to travel and endure strangers' hilarious events in three different eras, is the search for love, a very intricate subject for aristocrats seeking to search for money and self-interest. Every time "Three Ages" is shown in the Schlo√ütheater, it's always a pleasure to see a funny, funny silent movie (even for a serious German count), an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics. visual and amazing technical tricks, an absolute, quiet delicatessen that is perfect to endure the different and coarse summertime grades. <br /> <br /> And if you allow me now, I have to say goodbye for a while. This German count has to flirt with an old Germanic heiress who does not look her age. Count Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
