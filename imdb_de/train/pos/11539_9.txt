THE ODD COUPLE is the classic movie version of Neil Simon's most famous play on a television station called Felix Unger, who is an obsessive freak and pulls out of her apartment with his divorced best friend Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him. Already divorced, Oscar takes on his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway, with Art Carney Felix and Walter Matthau Oskar playing. Jack Lemmon takes on a memorable performance for Carney in the movie version as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role, but also so real that he gives the wretched character that is Felix Unger, a little melancholy. Fortunately, Matthau was allowed to reenact his role as Oscar, a unique gem of comic performance that consistently laughs. This interaction of Lemmon and Matthau proved to be comic gold, which was revisited in nine other films. If these two actors are no longer with us, the sight of this classic will be more touching, but no less funny. Simon's play was well expanded for the screen with a silent prologue that struck down a suicidal suicide attempt by Felix, who is a winner. The side cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar Poker buddies, as well as Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon Sisters, blind dates from Oscar and Felix. Later it became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. A pleasure from start to finish.
