This delicate, beautifully crafted production penetrated deeply bitter sweet into my being. The disrespectful disciples, the bus-embittered bus driver, and the teacher personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unfolds. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions so plausible and well-known. When a key event happens on the bus, we are sent to a circle of viewpoints. The babbling of teenagers' energy is always kept under control by the organizers of the journey. Mr. Harvey is in a lot of pain. He reminds me of war-damaged teachers that I did not understand when I was a disrespectful student. Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much credit for this well-formed British film. The drama is spotless, the scenes appropriate, it should be widely available but does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
