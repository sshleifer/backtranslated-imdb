Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a bit generous, but as far as the film is concerned, I think the directors have done a good job in providing what they have. This is also a movie with an acquired taste! <br /> <br /> My first thought was the direct connection to the classic cult movie "The Thing", ie the parasitic aliens from outer space that invade the human host, to seek devastation wherever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays homage to such a movie and other horror / horror genres, even though it cleverly retains its own originality. Well, these things fight each other and then eat the fallen rival! Just kill and select a human if he needs a new host! To pick another fight with another infected host! And this movie even throws in a love story, but I'm not saying anymore, otherwise there is too much. <br /> <br /> Great! But as said of an acquired taste, do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It's a low budget and yes, it's bloodthirsty, and the creatures / aliens / things turn their limbs into rough-looking weapons, d. H. Saws, drills, blades and even the weird weapon to almost decimate your opponent. I twisted at what I was shown, but at the same time glued to the screen and wondered what would happen next. <br /> <br /> So, if you're bloody, you like aliens, you like to fight and maybe even a little love that I threw in somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as a must. I just wish I had met that earlier.
