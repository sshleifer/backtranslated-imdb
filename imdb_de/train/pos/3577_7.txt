This movie probably never blended on the radar screen, but it has a lot of quality. It's pretty lifelike, but you think "it's just a movie." Duvall and Close show ordinary people and you would never realize that they are now famous actors. It seems that the jerk in this story is a bit too old to chase Eugeni's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It is unlikely that the child would travel alone from Montana to Nevada, but I think it is possible. You might think that the family issues in this movie would never be in your own family, but I think that's possible. I remember Glenn Close, who says, "The work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
