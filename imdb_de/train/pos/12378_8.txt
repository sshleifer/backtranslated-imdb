In the hands of a more experienced director, this film would have been a horror masterpiece. Despite the passable direction of Michael "Death Wish" Winners, the film is interesting, original and more than a bit scary. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is more than a horror clich√© (some can not shake it.)) including Chris Sarandon, a friend of the heroine who actually hears her, insisting that creepy things cease come. Burgess Meredith is charming as a lovably insane neighbor. Eva Gardner is busy with a young Beverly D'Angelo as a dumb and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a damn job in a chair. And watch out for a short cameo by an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is scary and creative. The actions are beautiful, albeit a bit predictable. The highlight of which I will not mention a detail is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with it, but it's quite satisfying - at least for those who have the sensitivity of the '70s horror. <br /> <br /> If you like modern, overproduced Torture Fantasy Fantasy, you've won't like it. There's almost no gore. The direction is pretty spartan. The effects are small, though there is a nice make-up in the end - most of them are not actually make-up ... but maybe I have already said too much. <br /> <br /> I've rated it a bit higher than its quality may warrant, but I enjoyed it as much as any of the "8" movies I've seen.
