This movie may sound dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin was just out of the hippie Dippie Weatherman and is in heavy satirical humor. This movie is the forefather of all. Enjoy it because of its historical significance as well as its high entertainment value.
