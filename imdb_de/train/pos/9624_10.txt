The film, which I thought was excellent, was probably romantic, with some tension between the two. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor. I do not know why people give him a bad rap. As far as Mel Harris is concerned, she is a great actress, and for those who think she looks too old for Rob, it's only five years. Rob had a starring role in his own TV series as well as in the TV series Scifi Channel I'm sure you remember Topical Heat, aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also starred in a number of television movies and is now making a television miniseries. <br /> <br /> You I have to give him more leadership roles, that's what he does best.
