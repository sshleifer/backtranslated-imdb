With the death of GEORGE NADER on February 4, 2002, I thought of this highly interesting program, which, though it only had a short run, was a great idea with good storylines. Usually not seen for over 40 years, it is worth to look at them again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was an excerpt from COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, who used his famous rocket sled to drive to the spot where he was often referred to as "The Fastest Man Alive".
