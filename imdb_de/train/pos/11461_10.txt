In addition to the fact that this film, in all its greatness, has exceeded all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrays the overuse of crappy filters in their best form! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brother conflict with everything that goes with it. As always, a woman facing her true intentions. The end was as startling as the killing of Keith Scott by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in 'Wiking Land' are the way I remember them from my early travels. - To be honest, my passion for garbage films is a must in my never-ending collection. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who falls in love with the greatest brothers of One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin
