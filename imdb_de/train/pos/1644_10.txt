I saw the second half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it on DVD. I recently watched some reality series about PBS about ranching and so on. None of them came as close to the story as this movie. Based on REAL reality, without blows, bleak, happy, tragic and enlightening, this film should be shown to students or anyone interested in early border life. Fine acting by both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell contributes to a well-crafted script. The opening speech states that this is done through National Endowment for Humanities funds. If this could be the kind of product taxes, I would be happy about more. I highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if he saw him and enjoyed the movie.
