Ever read Jim Thompson? He is a hard-nosed Noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. There are seldom private detectives in his work - only losers, psychotics, and little contemporaries. This movie has summed up Thompson: "If God has made real mistakes in this world, then He has given us the will to live if we have no excuse for it." Each character of the film balances on the razor blade between surreal and creepy realism. Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and the wickedly well-intentioned Doc Goldman by George Dickerson, is a grim, intriguing sight. Jason Patric does a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance as Kid Collins, a not-too-bright, shy ex-fighter more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy Femme Fatale we can not quite figure out ... It's neither your standard movie Noir, nor is it supposed to be. After Dark My Sweet and The Grifters, there are two excellent novel adaptations by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
