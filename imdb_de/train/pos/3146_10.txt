If television was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and a perfect plot, this show brought 8 wonderful seasons and a great pleasure for watching TV after dinner. With the constant change of relationships and finding out who Hyde's true father is, this show was a hit when it began in August of the year 98, although it was discontinued in 1976. and it still is today, along with circles. This show has laughed a lot in premieres, and it still does it at reruns. If you see some episodes of this show, you get everything and want more. Now, just this show is one of the best ever created, it's smart and funny.
