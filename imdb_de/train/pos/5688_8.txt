Opening credits: great. Music: just right for this movie. Cinematography: sloppy to great. <br /> <br /> Exciting way like train gap. That way, some lives can get out of control. "Wonderland" does not describe the drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) as a deviation, but shows how it actually happens in our society. It's better than pictures of another wild group - Manson's - because all of Manson's films, books, and so on, focus so much on Manson's insane mind as on the overall picture of the cheap glory and randomness that is so prevalent these days. > If you want to see some of the best "Method acts" in the movie, check out Kilmer in this movie. He shows how "The Method" can be torn into the right role. <br /> <br /> Here, the filmmakers manage to bring "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of it, it gives us cheap thrills.
