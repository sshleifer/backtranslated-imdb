I had not laughed so much for a movie in a while. The garbage that Hollywood has spent lately drives me to the wall! This was definitely fresh and funny. If you look at the demographic figures for the reviews, only a few women have voted! I do not want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and give it a bad rating. Because the movie takes men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because it actually has humor and not because it harms men ... this could easily be a "7" movie!
