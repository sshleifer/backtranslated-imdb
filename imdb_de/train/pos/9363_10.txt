This movie was amazing, it's the kind of movie you watch it in, and not other films by actor, but other films by director / author. Sandler did a good job of working a character out of his comfort zone, and the always good cheadle did a great job as well. This movie is perfect for a mature, intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be excelled by writing and governing the film. This film focuses on the true Americans, the past generation, no clich√©s or racism, only on people who have come together and recognized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing psychiatry, she does not define her as someone who magically heals you, but through the need to express your feelings to an impartial person whom you can trust will not judge you, but guide you through your thoughts. This movie is completely incredible!
