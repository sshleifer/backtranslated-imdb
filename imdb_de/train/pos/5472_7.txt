Barbara Stanwyck, a really tough cook, a working-class waitress (and prostitute at her father's hands) fleeing to New York City and using her female skills to get a file job, moves on to Mortgage and Escrow, and later as Deputy Secretary of the Deputy Bank. The dramatic study of a female figure who is not afraid of carelessness has lost none of their power over the years, and Barbara has played a storm (she shows a woman who herself is a first-rate actress). This woman brings a bit of Nietzschean philosophy into her nasty life and represses the feelings, but she never loses our fascination, our reverence. She is a simple, hard-boiled, broad woman, but she is not a bitch, nor a man-eater or woman-hater. This girl is all to herself, and while we wait for her to finally experience the true values ​​of life, her journey on the ladder of success ensures heated, sexy conversation. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye make-up) is very good in an early role as assistant in the archive, although all supportive players are pretty good. *** from ****
