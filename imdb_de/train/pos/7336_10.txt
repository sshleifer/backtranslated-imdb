This is another fantasy favorite by Ralph Bakshi; that's how it is after watching YouTube. Settled in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword and sorcery quest between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Ice Kingdom and his mother, Queen Juliana, has set himself the conquest of the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he swears (Larn) to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the subhuman minions of Nekron and Juliana take in Teekra's sultry daughter, Queen Jarol. But she manages to escape and eventually meets with Larn, who promises to bring her back to Firekeep. If the subhumans do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This film had very little box office (like most Ralph Bakshi films), but has become a cult classic, partly because of the quality of the art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. I also heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who wrote Conan comic stories, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; though admittedly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his artworks for figurines, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company in addition to paintings. And like Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings and American Pop films, this film was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the previous film. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is one of the best animations, fantasy films ever made, and a fantastic collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With a lot of imagination, sexual allusion and exciting adventure.
