The second Care Bears movie is much better than its predecessor. It has a deeper action, a better character development and the melodies (especially the final song) are catchy and warmhearted. Sure, the movie tends to handle stress, but come on, it's a Care Bears movie. This movie is a great picture for kids because it emphasizes friendship, love and care. Not to mention the Care Bears!
