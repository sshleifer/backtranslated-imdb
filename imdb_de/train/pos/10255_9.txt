This movie is the first of the six notorious Guinea Pig movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic to simply know that the film is fake. The story is about a woman who was captured and tortured in many ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and a manga video showing the torture. The men who capture them test a person's boundaries before they die. Some scenes are shocking, like the eyeball scene, and others are not shocking like the girl who is beaten 100 times as there are beats in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I would recommend this from age 17. <br /> <br /> 9/10
