Attention: mild spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith is an astonishing - albeit moving - episode in American history and the history of the religious history of the world. This film shows the events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons worship as prophets of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I've already seen the movie twice in public in its first month in public. Joseph Smith is the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) shown very young, needed surgery. The operation without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult. The scene helped demonstrate the cohesion of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayer that lead to an interesting presentation of what the Mormons call the First Vision. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you can see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. The rejection of religious leaders and many members of his small New York community is at least somewhat sweetened by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> In this film, the events of the Mormon Church story are not clearly depicted, but merely scene-by-scene is jumped. This is not a criticism - it is just a comment on the style. <br /> <br /> It shows how the tar and feather effect works. It is particularly dramatic and poignant when Joseph, with a scarred face, has recently been attacked for preaching the Savior's love. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the film masterfully portrays the joy and growth of Mormonism as a children's church, while at the same time representing the ever-deepening opposition that is spreading to the heights of local governments. </ br> <br /> The film features many scenes from Joseph's life, including some nice moments depicting his relationship with Emma. It seeks to demonstrate the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his passionate love for his wife, his infinite love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and compassion. <br /> <br /> When Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage to never return home alive, most of the characters from the entire movie whose lives have been touched by Joseph are shown en route, helping to what was to reinforce already seen, but the final scene made stronger. <br /> <br /> At the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and the audience has to think about the events they have just experienced. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie for the first time, I assumed it was made by the church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I do not think that's the case anymore, though I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider, I think that the film is a celebration of Joseph and the good things we already know about him, well underpinned. I wonder how outsiders will see the movie - whether they consider it simply as propaganda, as an epic story of an American religious man, or as something else. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully filmed, family friendly, and hopefully something good for everyone. That the events depicted in this United States have actually taken place is interesting in view of the many aspects of our culture, including the freedom of religious expression and the respect (generally) of the law, which we consider modern.
