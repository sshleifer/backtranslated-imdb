Sidney Stratton struggles to maintain his jobs in various garment factories, mainly due to his experiments in the textile labs. Stratton experimented with a formula for a new fabric that would create the ultimate fabric that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or wears out. When Stratton finally creates the stuff, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money because a mill has the exclusive rights) so that Stratton in his white suit becomes the most-hunted man in England , The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it that way. Guiness's performance (and a great minor cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's directing make the movie a blast, but the real hero is the story itself, a beautiful satire of business and industry with added elements of drama, romance, and suspense , Rating, 8.
