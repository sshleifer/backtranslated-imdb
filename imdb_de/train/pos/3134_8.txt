This was a well written story from the Making of the Batman sitcom, which brings together our heroes on a major quest and offers their TV show history. Unlike the documentary films of the Brady and Partridge families, we not only gain insight into the past and present lives of Adam and Burt, but also see them in action again. Batman is filled with Kapows and Catwomen and the Riddler (s). This story is not just a well-narrated report that not only brings us a satisfying conclusion to the Batman series, but also the modern fan in all the Hollywood stories about them talking about this port. It has been heard for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
