I could see this movie in its entirety and was deeply touched. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women has changed since Aunt Bee! They are alive, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback in this movie was that other characters were not mentioned in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows of the 1970s. I would have thought that since the set in New York City (where "Rhoda" had been set) at least her sister Brenda would have been mentioned or that Julie Kavner had appeared, assuming, of course, she was still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC makes this series into a series and brings all the old actors of these shows for guest appearances. By the way, what was wrong with CBS doing this reunion or eventual series? Was not this the network that wore the shows "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
