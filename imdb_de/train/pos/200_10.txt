Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy, which also features the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia, who plunges Hollywood with the help of Haines, a small player in rough comedies. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A big swarm of Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and guest appearances by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn and Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorelle Sebastian and Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a shout. A must for any serious movie lover or for anyone interested in the still evil Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the slimy captain. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE is said to have inspired the career of Gloria Swanson (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. However, the story of this film matches the rise of Swanson from the Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early '20s. Davies and Haines were a huge MGM stars and friends. Strange that MGM never put them together for a talkie. They are great together! A sweet romance and a sexy parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
