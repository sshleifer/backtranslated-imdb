I have just come back from the Montreal Zero Day premiere in Montreal ... and I am totally surprised to find a negative commentary on the film. Basically, it's the fault of Coccio's writing a simple and exaggerated social message ... Well, Mr.-I-a-Reviewer, it's a simple and exaggerated critic of socially charged films. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I'm from a small town with a similar school than these guys. Rejection & Ignorance in the menu. I understand how young kids can be made to do this horror. High schools have become battlefields of conformity. It is a really ugly sight. You have to find a way to be like the others. It's hard to explain, many people have not realized that colleges become cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, the parents close their eyes and smile that their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motive of the film is not the question of what drives it. It's about this deadly quiet suburb and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create that atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal expressed it well. It is a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and can take any form. In this case, small dramas (such as Andre, who is referred to as a fag to wear a J.C penny shirt) become the worst nightmare in a whole city. Andre and Cal have taken the most extreme way to express their pain. The malaise of nonconformity at a time when you need more than ever to be like the others in order to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes where some guys burn the crosses of Andre & Cal, as if with the pain they communicated, Cal & Andre shared their blind rage with their community, their refusal to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It may sound aggressive as a movie, but Coccio meditates more than whining or saying. What Andre & Cal live is a reality ... and a scary one that could appeal to other children. <br /> <br /> Disturbing movie ... Ben Coccio made a very disturbing film through home making and his strong feeling.
