I have been reading the modest Blaise for several years and collecting the numbers of the strip. After the fiasco movie was shot many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was so good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie not based on action or violence. The director had focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty created on the basis of her own story, and which parts of her life were affected by her non-childhood life? I think that will give the next (I hope) movie a better understanding. I just loved the old style of the movies. <br /> <br /> However, not everything was so good, playing was not so good. almost boring and unreal. The spectacle could have been improved as well. I do not think the evil in this movie was real. The only reason he was there was for Modesty to have someone to tell her story for. You could also have expanded the movie to learn more about when she builds "The Network," but I think that's for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me my bad English
