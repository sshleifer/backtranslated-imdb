This image John Lassiter would make today if there were no progress on CGI. And that's just to say that he would have forgotten if the technology had not done anything sexy since 1983. Twice ... has the same joke, imagination, and feel of the real excitement that would be found in a Pixar movie, run only under the limitations of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and great intonation to create a movie that appeals to many levels. It should be spoken in the same breath as _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
