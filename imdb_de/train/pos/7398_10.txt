Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and undemanding and at the same time rewarding in emotions and joy. The story is simple and the theme of the old and new collision is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but without the great characters and actors they portray, it would have remained flat. <br /> <br /> The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's days before expansion. He leads a bathhouse in an old neighborhood. Every single scene in the bathhouse is a source of jelousy for us stressed, unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find flaws in this wonderful environment. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally handicapped son, Er Ming, is the second truly powerful character in the film to connect with his modern brother. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bathhouse are amazingly detailed and heartfelt, with some scenes bringing so much emotion beyond anything seen in movies-critical message, this one Film was not only censored, but also treated with inappropriately short range. It could be a coincidence, but if a movie of this caliber itself (!) Is virtually not found on the Internet, you can not become suspicious. <br /> <br /> So help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you own the DVD, if there is one, then share share!
