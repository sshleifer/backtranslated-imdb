I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictitious state, but obviously it is the murder of Kennedy. An honest and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder of single Daslow (= Oswald) was planned and executed. Although all other officials want to close the case, he is constantly conducting investigations with his team. <br /> The script is tight and fast written and holds the suspense until the very end. Only the part that deals with the Milgram experiment on authorities is a bit out of place (if not uninteresting). The final sequence, which explains who Icarus really is, shot in slow motion and amplified by a Morricone soundtrack, is the strongest sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
