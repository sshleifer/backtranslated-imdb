Home Room really surprised me. Compared to other films written in relation to Columbine High School, this film is the best. The living space does not show the shooting of the school, but the consequences and the impact of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposing characters. Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outsider who witnessed the entire shootout. She does not seem to show any emotions. Deanna is a beloved girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia needs to visit Deanna in the hospital to get a degree. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecia when she knew the shooting would take place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at first. Finally, they develop each other and become friends. (very in the style of the breakfast club). Living Room Beautifully displays the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
