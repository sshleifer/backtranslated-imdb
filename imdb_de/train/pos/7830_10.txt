In "The Nibelungen: Siegfried" Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild seeks revenge. She marries Hagen and finally, through a series of events, performs a very drastic (but appropriate) action. <br /> <br /> One of the things that can be seen in this movie today is that we can look at certain representations. Attila the Hun (referred to in the movie Etzel) is shown as a stranger from the East, possibly an evocation of the Soviet Union. Obviously it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "Das Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but you can see what the FÃ¼hrer liked about the story. Nevertheless, this is an absolutely impressive movie.
