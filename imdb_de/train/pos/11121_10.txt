As a guy who has seen all seasons, I can say that JG always surprises me. I mean, after seeing him change from laugh to paranoia over the seasons, and after every little gesture he made, you think he's a gangster. But when I saw him open his eyes and fight for his life, I could almost feel my pain, that he "made us believe" that he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generation and more. But these days, they're either old or dead (Brando) and it's okay that they make fewer films and their performances are "easier" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films in which he plays a completely different role. Can you recommend some of his older films that give a memorable performance?
