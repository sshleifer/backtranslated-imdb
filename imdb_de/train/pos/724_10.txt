The movie is just fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" when the movie was made. I've seen the movie over and over from myself and friends, and it's still fresh and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a particular band is timeless and the boredom of high school students with the drudgery of some classes is timeless as well. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some jewels / scenes ..... References to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life. (I can assure you that I did not attend high school for a few years and it does not follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I get static") ..... "Not so much how you will get ", as the director Togar comes closer) ..... the school board, which is so old-fashioned that it is visited by nurses ... the Nazi Hall Monitors love a" body search "...... Chef Togar announced "I'll give you the final solution" and burn the Ramones records (note: records were what came before the CDs) ... and of course Joey Ramone, who states, "Things are for sure Changed as we were thrown out of high school, "followed by Togar with the question," Do your parents know you're Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Just a piece of advice ..... do not look for stars now ... Joey Ramone unfortunately died young. Dey Young, who was a big hottie in the movie, reminds us today that we are all old ... PJ Soles career has never progressed as far as we could have imagined ... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the others Students, apparently only appeared in this film (one of my male friends dies each time we watch the movie), although I have more than adequately portrayed her performance and brought her more youthful film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So look and enjoy ..... do not think .... just have fun!
