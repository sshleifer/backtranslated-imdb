Good action and interesting action. After seeing the original, I have to say that it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the film. Good cast .. meaningful drama .. though it would be nice to see more expansion in the action scenes than in the backstory. An exciting movie to watch and ensure that you are always up to date. 7/10 is a right voice, I think!
