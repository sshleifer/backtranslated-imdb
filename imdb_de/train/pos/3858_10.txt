Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varying quality, but most of the films he shot in his homeland are undeniable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who draws to a beautiful rich and very strange woman. However, the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the pretty male lover of the woman. In the meantime, the author is plagued with strange visions - at first they seem like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he soon realizes that he is actually experiencing some kind of foreshadowing. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you feel like they're something, but then you realize that it's something completely different. This is one of those films; a thriller in the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of future director Jan de Bont. We recommend!
