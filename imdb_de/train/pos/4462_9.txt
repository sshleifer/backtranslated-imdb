Anchor's Aweigh is one of the first of the finest musicals and features several memorable musical sequences: Kelly dances with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dances with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra sings with Jose Iturbi on the piano and Kathryn Grayson sings with Iturbi conducting and more , The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera features, such as: A piano, played from below by transparent keys, and Grayson vocals seen through the viewfinder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you will be amazed by Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailors on vacation, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls in love with his aunt. In order to arrange with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra has her audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this and in his own sung words too quickly in love. While trying to make contact with Iturbi, who is never available, he falls into another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly falls in love with Grayson now. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination of live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more that are worth a look. I give it nine stars because it's not quite as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man and Oklahoma - but it's one of the first of their big technicolor productions (maybe Meet Me In St. Louis was the first and better than most others.
