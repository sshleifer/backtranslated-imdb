Maybe Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story, and although Angela is adorable, she was a very different actress from the great Julie Andrews. Lansbury is perfectly staffed and delivers a magical performance. There is something delicious about her character and she is wonderfully supported by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a melody, but as a singer, he certainly is not much to hack. It does not matter that he was such a gifted actor you barely notice. There are some awesome cameos of popular stars from another time, such as Roddy McDowel, who offers a great performance, and the popular Tessie OShea, which does very little, but it's nice to see the old girl again. It's also great to see Sam Jaffe and King of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score contains a few beautiful songs, especially The Sea and the age of non-belief. The great Portabello Road is stretched to the limit, but has a lot of theater. The effects are a bit clich√©d today, but the scene in which the German invaders are attacked by the wildest army in the movie is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies, but you can barely understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the Army Army. The Home Guard was very important to Great Britain and this is a heartfelt tribute. The animation is adorable, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. A warm, happy movie and it's a miracle it's not being done on stage.
