I have no interest in rap and in ghetto culture I am white and I like classic rock. That did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's pretty much a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just rap or rock. Nevertheless, it is funny. There are many funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that simply fall off. The characters are all very funny and believable. I just watched because it made me laugh at 3am, and any movie that does that requires at least a test demonstration. One of the reasons why this movie was so funny was that it made fun of another rap. Rap deals with the wrong things today and gets by with studio noise and little talent. This movie is from a time when rappers have earned more recognition. All in all, it's a fun movie with lots of jokes about racism, sex and music culture, among the most obvious topics of humor. This is highly recommended for every fan of This is Spinal Tap. It's essentially the same movie, just different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
