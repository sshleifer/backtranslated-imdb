Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit pushy and trashy and obviously his job suffers from that of his pretty famous brother, but this may be his best movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that Scott Denzel (in scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation of who Dakota Fanning is, gives time to a relationship of genuine warmth and tenderness to develop. The setup is absolutely NOT boring, though it takes time - it's included and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including an outstanding role for Radha Mitchell as a mom. All of this serves to make the action as effective as we are invested in the characters, despite all their apparent weaknesses. This movie has you on the edge of the whole and will not get out in the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie would not be without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many Duff roles, though he's clearly as good as almost every leading man out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who now has more power on the screen Has). , This film should have been huge considering its status and the strength of its performance and the quality of the film. It only shows that a studio that does not fully support a movie goes straight to the video. I wish I had the chance to see this on the big screen.
