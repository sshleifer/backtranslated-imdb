Another classic study of the impact of wealth on a Southern family is masterfully presented in Written on the Wind. Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, an airplane, call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always got him out of trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was kicked out. Mitch is not from a wealthy home. Kyle's family with Hadley Oil controls most of the city. <br /> <br /> In New York, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlwind romance, he marries her and brings her home. There she meets her father-in-law, who warns her about how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle is sleeping with a gun under his pillow. The Bacall character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp, if any, played by Dorothy Malone, who has been voted best supporting actress. Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. <br /> A year of bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he can not have any children. When his wife tells him that she is indeed pregnant, Kyle believes that the child is Mitch, he gets drunk and is accidentally shot in a memorable scene. Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, but does not try to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable scene in the courtroom, Malone did everything to finally admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Your Oscar deserved to be earned. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and lost in an angry win by Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life. <br /> Douglas Sirk was the master of soap opera films of the 1950s. Written on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
