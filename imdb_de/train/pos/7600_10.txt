After becoming addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would ever be another show that would be nearly as good as this one. Well, I was wrong! Lost is captivating !! I absolutely love this show and can not switch it off. The richness of the characters, the subtleties of the plot and the beautiful surroundings are amazing. I am totally and totally addicted. I do not know how the creators do it, but every character touches me deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything to the core !!! I do not have a cable, so I borrowed the series from Netflix. When I put it on, I watch all the episodes at once and I'm sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next CD to arrive at my house. This is probably the best TV show I have ever seen !!!
