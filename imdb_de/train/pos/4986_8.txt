Lensman is a rather unknown anime gemstone from the studios of Toho and MK. It is loosely based on the novel, but reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, you'll see it's in Japanese with subtitles or just Japanese. The English version was almost cut off and edited to death. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new, though it's the first animated feature that combines CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's still fun to watch.
