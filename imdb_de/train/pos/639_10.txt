This is a good family show with great actors. It's a nice break from the Reality Show Blitz lately. There's nothing like it on TV at the moment either, unless Joan of Arcadia is considered similar because she also has a youthful main character. Clubhouse is definitely worth a look, as Jeremy Sumpter gives the character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and naivety that is appealing without being too sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the rest of the lead actors, and everyone is great in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; She's quite a pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother, even though she does not like showing it. It may take a few episodes to find the legs, but Clubhouse is without a doubt one of the best shows that have come along for a long time. So look at the people - you will be happy!
