How to lose friends and alienated people came out in 2008. He bombed the US funds. It's an absolutely funny movie with a great cast. Simon Pegg plays great with Sidney Young, who wrote the book: "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People I Know It's Not a Real Story." The only way I know is that Sidney starred with an actress Sophie Maes does not exist, but otherwise the film could be real: losing friends and strangers is probably the funniest movie of the year 2008. I think you should absolutely see it Fantastic cast including: Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, The Jungle Suicides) Danny Huston (The Number 23, 30 Days Night) Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen) Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing All in all, it's very funny to lose friends and alienate people, I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well together, and I think you should see it, even though there's a weird nudity , including transsexuals It's a funny and great comedy, one of Simon Pegg's best. <br /> <br /> The content: Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels to New York to work for Sharp. There he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.
