Well, I'm happy about the rumor that this could finally be released on DVD. I do not know when that will happen, but I will get it when it's published. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining movie, especially when "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's ring career begins in the movie. Then it turns from a good movie to a great one. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and still be a likable good guy like Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example of that. Supposedly this was Flynn's favorite role, and I think so. You can just feel how much fun he had here. Ward Bond also looks like he really enjoyed his role in the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond was never better either. <br /> <br /> There are just the right amount of action boxing scenes here and they are pretty well done too. The family of Corbett is also fun when she plays in the stands during Jim's matches. Out of the arena, the constant argument and screaming of the Corbett family can be a little too loud and annoying, but they set the scene for a fitting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Sullivan's speech to Corbett after The fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some mean-spirited critics (for example, Variety) did not like the end, or the fact that much of the film is fictional, but-most-are fictitious, whether they like it or not. And in this case, it made for a nice story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very quiet gentleman, not like Flynn's portrayal, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the more entertaining classic movies I've ever seen and me wait for the DVD.
