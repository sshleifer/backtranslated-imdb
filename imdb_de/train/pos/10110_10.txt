Each story includes a premise, characters, and conflicts. Characters who promise their own game triumph, and a militant character lends itself to this. Ardh Satya's premise is summarized by the eponymous poem by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "my paluns my napunsaktha, doosre palde my paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance between right and wrong (usually on the busts of blind justice in the courts) has powerlessness on one plate and skill on another - is the needle in the middle half a truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is recited halfway between Smita Patil and Om Puri in a restaurant. It deeply affects the protagonist and forms the basis for much of the later events. At the end of the movie, Om Puri finds himself in exactly the same situation that was so aptly described in the poem. The film makes a great effort to make the poem unique. However, Chitre's words are too powerful, and at best, the film fits the poem in every way. <br /> <br />
