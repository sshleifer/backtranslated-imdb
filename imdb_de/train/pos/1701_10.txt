This is a stupid movie of a thinking man. If you do not count on Star Wars and enjoy British humor, this could become a cult classic for you, as well as for my wife and me - from the voice of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Martians to the all too simple people of Big Bean This is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy in both ways. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxed, simple humor, it takes a quick mind to see the joke. When it's over, you'll enjoy this movie.
