The master extortionist, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "The Adventures of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first Sherlock Holmes story I ever saw with Jeremy Brett. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a somewhat bleak, sad feeling, but it's pretty entertaining (with some particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and dr. Watson seeks to expose the identity of an illusionist blackmailer who has ruined some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that in one way or another would destroy their lives. They finally find out that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer," after the few tragic consequences for the victims who could not pay. Our heroes have next to help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay a sum that does not reach her funds, otherwise her upcoming marriage will definitely be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson break into Milverton's house is intense. Although the movie has a happy ending, the tone is sad and unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as a notorious villain (most viewers probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes between her and Holmes are a rebellion). I give it a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I wish they had added to the scene at the end of the short story, where he described the description of the two burglars, one of which agrees with Watson.)
