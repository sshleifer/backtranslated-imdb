Although the plot elements of "The Eighth Day" look like they've been done many times, the movie still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always be on my favorites list, the film still leaves a lot of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001 The Flavorless The Closet, plays down his role and is afraid to exaggerate (rightly, the role could easily have been ruined if the actor were too dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a bit more realism as it focused more on the character itself than on the figure's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not go into this movie and expect dark humor and unexpected twists you got from "Toto the hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not faulty, film
