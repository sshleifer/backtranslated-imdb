I have to say, looking at Hamlet from a student's perspective, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His commitment to staying true to the original text should be welcomed. It helps bring the game to life on screen, making it easier for people to keep the text, while as we've been studying it, tracking the text and analyzing it many times has been criticized for casting the most important Hollywood Names in the piece. I think that helps the viewer to recognize the characters more easily, unlike actors who all look and sound to help with the confusion that normally occurs in Shakespeare's ambiguity in the text. For example, how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really was, and why Fortinbras happened to be at the castle in the end. All in all, this version does not just contain some brilliant performances by actors who do not know Shakespeare. It is portrayed as not having to be an English literary scholar to understand and enjoy it.
