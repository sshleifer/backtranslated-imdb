If you have had a drama in your life, either through your own or someone close to you, the painful stages of this woman (but in my opinion, it could also have been a man) are very real. It's a movie where you can not handle your pain and do not know what to do to help yourself. Of course, then, it's also a film about not knowing how to help someone in your area get through their pain. It's a movie where you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that could push someone over the edge ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure if I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially someone close up, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in the right perspective, shows real pain and therefore for that Life is very important. It makes you realize that Hey, you or the person close to you has been in pain, that all the things you are worried about now are of little importance
