We recorded that when it aired on television in 1995, and have been waiting for its release all these years because it quickly became a favorite of our family. The kids are now teenagers and must have seen it many times. Still, they still watch it religiously with friends. Its timeless appeal extends across all age groups - much like "fat". Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander gorgeous and wonderfully light on his feet. I've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rude to him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We loved his "Giant Step" number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) gives us weird relief and wonderful music numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was the performance of Kim by Chynna Philip. Part of it has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. That's complicated, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just terrible. The director should have seen and corrected that. Or never throw them out first. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the picture is appealing and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
