One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and loved both of them. It is the story of a young man who is preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not make a living in Ireland. It is narrated from the perspective of the young man (whom the other characters in the film can see) as well as another young man who portrays his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but who can not be seen by the other characters in the film. It's a very sad movie, but very touching, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think about it. I love every Irish movie, or almost every movie about Ireland, and every movie that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann in it makes my voice a shame to have lost it so young.
