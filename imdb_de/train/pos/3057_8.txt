Wow, I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as a quiet hit man Alex. <br /> <br /> All performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br Alex, a married hit man (like his father) with a young son, is in a middle aged crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to a psychiatrist for help and meets the boy Will Sarah, whom he falls in love with. One day Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to watch it if you like interesting, mature movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
