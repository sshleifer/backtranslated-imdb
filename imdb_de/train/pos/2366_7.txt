This movie (with the alternate title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) was introduced to me by Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be a great fighter. The action scenes in this movie are great! By the way, there are many. The recruit fight at Peacekeepers Headquarters is especially good. There is only one single man to beat the crap out of a group of people who are really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like these match her (but not others). Matthias Hues has also done a good job as usual. He is a great fighter and a macho character and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
