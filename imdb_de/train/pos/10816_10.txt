No, this should not be a high budget brilliance, but it is brilliant by itself. You need to look at what it is, a low-budget masterpiece with a zombie rapist carrying a 12-inch love rod he keeps fluttering. Those who gave a low review on this film were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden "gem," they say, and just did not get that far. I love how everyone draws attention to obvious observations, like the "5-cent baby attached to a fishing rod," hahaha, well. I do not think a movie with such a budget can do "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. The guts and innards were really very convincing. The movie was a bit choppy from sequence to sequence, but overall this is one of the better movies I've seen lately that follows no trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
