I have seen this movie a second time to find out why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been and discovered significant artistic merit - which could ultimately have been its commercial reversal /> <br / > First of all, this movie tries "serious" sci-fi movies, social commentary, more than action-adventure. It's action in it, but that's not the point. If you focus on it, you get (as others have noticed) a bad "aliens" clone. But again, this is not about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is really about the transformation of Todd (Kurt Russell) from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly * back *). But because it does not try to give you a typically giddy Hollywood-style response, Kurt Russell has to make that transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job - it takes two points of view to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it is never adequately clarified whether Todd is able to stand up to an army of Tehran, allegedly superior troops come from his experience on the battlefield or from his newfound humanity or what, but the movie is still a wonderful showcase for Russell's (easily underestimated) talent.
