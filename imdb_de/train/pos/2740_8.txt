Huge black and white night films and much more underscore this supposedly true life story of a Kansas homicide fiasco in which a whole family was wiped out by two men. The story was written by Truman Capote, so at the end of the movie you'll get the very liberal anti-death penalty message, which is ridiculous if you know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted life and unnecessarily murder this nice family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying tendency at the end, this is an exciting story right from the beginning, and cinematography makes this even more fascinating. The famous photographer Conrad Hall has made this fantastic. I wish more modern movies are done in black and white. See on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey, and the rest of the cast are outstanding. My third appearance in the movie was in early April 2005, shortly after Blake was declared innocent of murdering his wife in real life. You can not help but look at Blake and this movie differently.
