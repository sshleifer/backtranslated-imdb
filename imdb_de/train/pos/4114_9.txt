The title of this movie does not make much sense until you put it into operation, because it's the sound a retarded young man makes while driving his imaginary car, which he does all day. And he's just one of many weird characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. There are two drunks who swap women, there is a man with aspirations Be architect and his little son, whom he asks to eat. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of reason in all areas around him, and there is a businessman with some nervous tics who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) like dirt. <br /> <There is no particular conspiracy, really, it's a series of stories that move back and forth, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it worked pretty well, and for a long time, I'd been content to just see it because of its description. I was not in the least disappointed and would definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10.
