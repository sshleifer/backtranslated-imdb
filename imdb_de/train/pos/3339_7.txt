The Farrelly brothers Bobby and Peter are back. With "Fever Pitch," the makers of other films that have tackled many gross themes are giving up this tactic as they decide to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen, something that would have been hard to achieve. The novel, with the same title, deals with a man's obsession with football as he plays in England, where this sport eats most British sports fans. It is thanks to the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell to turn the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "" Fever Pitch "is a movie featuring a compulsive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life revolves around the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth class teacher with uncanny ways, his students When Ben brings four of his best students for a visit to a local company, he meets up and falls hopelessly in love with the clever Lindsey Meeks, a young woman traveling at thirty-three, but no The story tells the two lovers through the ritual of visiting the Red Sox at home games at Fenway Park, the fans of this team are probably the most loyal people in the world and they have stayed with a team Doing wonderful things, but did not win World Series until 2004. After what we heard, the end had to be changed, because this year they finally won the event, which gave them eighty-six years was gone! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the middle of the movie. Ms. Barrymore is a natural, who always surprises when she appears in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a well-known television comedian and film actor, has a better chance here, in our humble opinion, than in his last appearance in Taxi. <br /> <br /> The Farrelly movie will also please its fans as baseball fans with this baseball story.
