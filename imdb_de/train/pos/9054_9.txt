"October Sky" is a movie that steals your heart, invigorates your mind with vivid imagery and raises your mind. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seems so easy at first, especially if the movie is set in a mining town where the future is as clear as the coal mines in the mine. But Homer can not follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff and his friends, Homer is trying to make his dream come true. <br /> <br /> But as in any lifelong history, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lets us down to the coal mines, where we witness the terrible plight of miners bent over under a rock blanket. With illuminated helmets and bent stance, they resembled alien insects more than humans in the dark. The chopping cough of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the moody loads of the mine shaft, the images of Homer and the rocket launch of his friend are shown. Under the blue skies, rockets are put on a pad and shot into the stratosphere ... And nothing fits the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie that way? Adorable is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son despite her many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is also evident. At best, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not bind everything in a nice arc. It tears you up, lifts you up. It's a touch of reality, which is important in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This film can be considered as a complete work. At first I was disappointed that the movie did not continue with Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... that makes a good movie with a person. If it has done its job, it should not end. And "October Sky" does just that.
