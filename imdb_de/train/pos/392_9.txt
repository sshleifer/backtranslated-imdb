The legend of Zu was, as I saw it, a very interesting story. I think many of the people who did not like it did not see the underlying mythology behind the film. They expected something similar to Star Wars, and that was not it. I think Joseph Campbell would have liked this movie. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a sword mountain in us. We all have to go into our own blood cavity sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Granted, some of the stories were a bit confusing, and some of the actions were sometimes a bit hokey, but I think other points in the movie easily made up for it. I would look at it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between the legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and To Warriors (the dubbed USA version.) Audience that really is from this Movie would have impaired.
