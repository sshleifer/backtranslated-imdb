"Moonstruck" is a nice little film, which is directed by the great storyteller Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). The movie is great on many levels. It shows a good deal of Italian culture, a touching romance and (at best) a funny comedy. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the movie was the relatively unconventional look of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks for the largest part of the film is positive, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little strange. Overall, it's a fun movie and easy to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
