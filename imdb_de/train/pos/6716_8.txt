Late, First-Class Drive-In Filmmaker Drama Al Adamson trumps himself with this glorious sci-fi softcore comedy that explores delicious, dark and gloomy depths of pure celluloid dillness and breathtaking stupidity. In the bleak totalitarian future of 2047, sexuality was viewed as an illegal act by the Big Brother-like, powerless idiot controller (an amusing silly Erwin Fuller). Sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (radiant blonde sweet pie Catherine Erhardt), however, remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of her finely feathered Fairy Godfather (a flamboyant Campy Jay B. Larson), Cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan to seduce the handsome stallion Tom Prince (the dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teach everyone that love love is positive , pleasant and completely acceptable activity. <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with its usual incompetence for all the thumbs and stages the unbelievably horrible 'n' sect 'song and dance sequences with a totally unfavorable lack of skill and flair. The terribly vile number "We All Need Love" with people in absurd animal costumes dancing clumsily in the woods is an unbelievably hideous miracle; This also applies to the equally disgusting "Mechnical Man" routine with a bunch of awkward robots. Louis Horvarth's raw, static cinematography, the sticky plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's groovy, pulsing disco score, the abundant unfounded nudity (the gorgeous brunette Sherri Coyle justifies a special praise in this particular section), the stubborn, perverted, perverted occasions (Roscoe) particularly irritating is the Robot Law Enforcer), and the equally dreadful performances (Renee Harmon's scandalous portrayal of Cinderella's evil, cocky stepmother revealing the big boobies here) reinforce the conspicuously rich cheesiness enjoyed in this delicious, terrible Doozy.
