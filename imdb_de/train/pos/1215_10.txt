This is my favorite of the three nursing baby movies. Again I liked all songs. The big problem, however, as most people have pointed out, is that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first movie, the bears met their "cousins" they apparently never knew. Of course, it was not until the end that the cousins ​​received their belly symbols after proving how much they cared. In this story, however, the cousins ​​grow up with the foster bear and have all the belly symbols. That being said, this is not a bad movie as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I found the Darkheart character much more evil than the Santa Claus of the first one. But at the same time, I felt that it added a kind of balance to the sweetness of the care-bear. I also liked the part we take care of in the end, though I know that other people had mixed feelings about this scene. And of course I loved the songs. My favorites are Growing Up and Forever Young. The Care Bears movies have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
