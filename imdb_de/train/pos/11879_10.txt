This is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> If the film has a flaw, it comes at you like a furious cop. It is not so much that the viewer is attacked. Scarface is as greedy and adamant as Tony Montana. The imagination of the viewer is left nothing. <br /> <br /> Moroders boring Synthpop fits the action to the tee. As the choir in a Greek tragedy whines and crunches, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's relentless fate. <br/> 'rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway move.
