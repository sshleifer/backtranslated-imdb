OK. There are people who should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not see him if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) I do not like being offended by _The Watchmen_. 3) Do not look it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you run, do not go to see _Mystery Men_. It's weird, it's quirky, it's a delightful broadcast of every bad superhero clich√© you know. Occasional rambles in junior-high humor do not ruin the unconventional fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, as well as some amusing smaller parts by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Nice to see Louise Lasser at work too.) I laughed the whole way. Totally dubious, a bit strange, but good.
