I'll tilt the scales a bit and say I liked that. However, the cartoon will only appeal to those who have very absurdistic tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as well as the nature of absurdism. <br /> <br /> The animation is awful, but yes, that's the point. The main character is smelly, violent and stupid. no redeeming qualities. His wife screams and howls, apparently barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories are completely missing at a certain point. <br /> <br /> But that is also the point, you will love it. <br /> <br /> It's really short so I would probably rent instead of buy.
