I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after having been here for three years. I was afraid I could contract myself when I look at it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. The film has pleasantly surprised me how exactly it portrays the cultural struggle between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not all things are factually accurate, but the sound is perfect. <br /> <br /> I will be in Japan many years later and I continue to enjoy this film for the equal treatment of both sides in the story. Although the Japanese-American actors originally spoke Japanese, the dialogue was renamed the Japanese version to mask obvious problems with second-language playback. <br /> <br /> I've found that a reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can find out more about what you can expect from an encounter with Japan when you watch this movie than when you read one of the "serious" books on the subject (most were written in the 80's and by the Propagation of Japanese companies funded). <Do not be fooled by the poor rating of the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who find it implausible, among other things, that the Japanese want to build cars in the US. (Of course, the Japanese run many factories to be close to the customers and avoid trade conflicts.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would rate higher if it were not for a few clichÃ©s of the 80s, like dancing cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.
