Many reviews on this site mention that this movie is a bit dark for kids. That depends on the child. This is not a movie for a 2-6 year old; It is more geared towards 8-year-olds and older people. I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved it. At the time, most animated films were a bit too childish for my taste. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this movie, characters can die and be sent to HELL! This gives the scenes where characters risk their lives a slightly more emotional weight. The good guys are not always cute and nice (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations like revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship. shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent Movie
