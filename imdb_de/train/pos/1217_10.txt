I was afraid my daughter might have the wrong idea. I think that the "Dark Heart" character is a bit rough and I do not like how it turns into a "mean" frog, fox, boy. I was wrong. This movie was made for my child, not for me. She "gets it" when it went over my head. Of course I do not understand it. This is not one of the NEW children's movies adults will enjoy ALL. This is right for the boys, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political scrap ethers. There is no magic key that could save the world from us, no one has the right to access excesses, and everyone is not always happy. And as a side effect nobody dies! Russ Will.
