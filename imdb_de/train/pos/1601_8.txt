It's a pretty simple, not very active, but very charming movie. There were times when I could see why Cher had won the Best Actress Oscar, but sometimes I wondered why Glenn Close could not win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe won and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a low-paid low-key woman who was just asked by Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her that he will be back in a month since his mother is ill, so she says while he needs to get as much of his family as possible to the wedding. The only problem is, when they find Johnny's one-handed brother Ronny (Golden Globe, who has been nominated for Nicolas Cage), they start a relationship and that's where the love for this lunar scene goes on (where the title comes from). Also nominated for an Oscar was Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe and won Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy with each other. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, the script written directly for the screen, and was nominated for Best Director by Norman Jewison (In the Heat Of The Night) and Best Picture. It was nominated for the BAFTA's Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay Golden Globes. It was number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("Grab 'em!"), It was number 17 on 100 years, 100 Passions and it was number 41 on 100 years, 100 laughs. Very well!
