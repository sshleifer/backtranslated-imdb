I know the movie snobs are snorting. If you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-Movie jungle, try "Jake Speed." <br /> <br /> Sometimes a bit thin, but the one-liners and the location more than make up for it. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to enjoy his role as an extremely vicious white slave. The Nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the movie that only a professional like Hurt can offer. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jake's Sidekick) are a good team, though you're wondering why they both agree. Together, Crawford and Christopher form a team that is so much fun when you can overcome yourself. For a moment, you can behave like a child in situations and inherent tension. Delicious Karen Kopins does a great job as a girl in need, more concerned with the motives of her savior than her tormentor. <br /> <br /> I have yet to find a movie that is just as fun without preaching or curbing the movie by over-struggling. Not every movie has to be the latest "Citizen Kane". And trust me, Wells was an original. So let's remember that movies are sometimes fun. No social commentary or attempt to influence an audience politically. But just for the fun of living and living in a time when our heroes live in a celluloid dimension.
