It is always nice to see how Angela Bassett plays a role that she can truly immerse herself in. She is sometimes intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colorful" woman forced to build a home on an abandoned mudbank outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also doing well in a not quite sympathetic role as her partner Boesman. Willie Jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as a stranger who discovers Boesman and Lena's new residential area. It's not often that you see a smart movie that deals with mature topics. Although it's a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the footage by spinning the film in cinemascope widescreen format. He also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things that are only mentioned in the piece. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have led Angela Bassett to an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie worth looking for.
