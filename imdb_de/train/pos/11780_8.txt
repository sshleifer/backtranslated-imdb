This is a documentary that happened to hit me on British television More4, and I have to say I found it very interesting and thought-provoking. I will also look for the book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically, this is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond, which says why certain parts of the societies of the earth prospered and others did not. The argument he put forward was new to me, arguing that the assets of the right crops and the right animals that were able to be domesticated are certainly compelling. As for the documentary itself, it's well-filmed and well-told, with not too many of the newly created scenes spoiling many modern documentary films. Diamond also helps because he is not too condescending, which is a debt of many intellectuals when he tries to bring a message to the masses. People have said his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it and see it as a sociologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the development of society that is not based on religion. We recommend.
