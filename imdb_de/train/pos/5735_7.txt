This is a short, roughly animated series by David Lynch (as it says at the beginning) and follows the mishaps of a hillbilly carrying a large man, a woman suffering from a stress disorder, and an annoying son. Both elements are repeatedly found in the short episodes, and there is no real conspiracy to be seen. It's easier to think of this as oddly odd, somewhat macabre Looney Tunes - with much more gore, profanity, bloody violence, and occasional funny moments. I've bought the DVD together with Eraserhead before, Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - this is anything but. In fact, it seems almost a statement against such things, as the rough style spits out in the face of any kind of animation convention you see. As Lynch says, "If that's funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of everything."
