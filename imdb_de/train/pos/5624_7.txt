I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really incredible in this movie. The emotion she must have lived through does not have to be forgotten. This was a very tough movie to see, the subject is extremely uncomfortable and you feel so helpless when you sit and watch a woman being abused for an eternity. I actually felt that the whole thing was easing a bit when their friends returned to the house, and I did not find the conclusion plausible at all. The director seemed very keen to use the height in his settings, and he loved using mirror reflections. I think he should have paid more attention to the tempo in the second half of this piece. I am sure that this will be a powerful play. This movie was for me, even though he had a merit, just too short.
