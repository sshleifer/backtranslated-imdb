God! Zorro was the subject of about as many films as Tarzan and probably had about as many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites, and as mentioned earlier, it is one of the top 5 sound series. Strangely, this is a production that came out in 1939. * At the time of this production in 1939, Zorro was known as (Pulp) writer and movie character. The film opens with a small footnote about the history of the Mexican struggle for freedom from a European monarchy, namely Spain. The story invites comparison with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical province of San Mendelito and its "Council". It is addressed by Benito Juarez ** about the relationship of their gold mine to the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must reach Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Diego's Uncle Diego Vega claims to have organized a group of patriots to serve as a Gold Convoy Protectorate. A thug from the Don del Oro Mob staged an "insult" to himself and challenged Don Francisco to a duel with swords. Don Frasncisco is run over. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the dark masked swordsman seems to be leading the sword fight and after he has carved the trademark. 'Z' on the face of the evil, he sends him into the afterlife. Don Francisco explains with his breath Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles. He also tries to tell about the true identity of Don del Oro, but falls prey to the conclusion of the statement. <br /> <br /> There is a big reception for Diego in the hacienda of Don Francisco, where Diego Ramon'sister (also the community of San Francisco) disappoints Don Francisco) with his timid act. "A FOP !!", she explains. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon slip in to meet with a volunteer meeting. If they ask, "Who will kill us now with Don Francisco?" Ramon explains, "Zorro, we're Zoro's Fighting Legion!" Well, there is a big fight with the Legion, now dressed in gray, with masks and capes protecting the gold train. Then Zorro seems to be caught in a man-made avalanche destined for the convoy when you know the end of the first chapter. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most other series, the opening line is longer and there's a lot of reason to do it. Let's just say that there are 11 more good, well-made, action-packed chapters that follow. <br /> <br /> ZORRO's FIGHTING LEGION contains all the elements that make for top cliffhanger action. We have an unknown evil leader who causes trouble between different groups. There are a number of suspects who really stuck behind the mask of Don del Oro. We had soldiers, rogue whites, hostile Indians, and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it is safe to say that everything in this series is what one could wish for. By the way, they decide wisely not to let the actors act on Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> What exactly is ZFL apart from ZFL? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a much more elaborate and exciting music score that underlines the drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition in the Cantina in Chapter One. This is probably the only time such a highly specialized innovation appears in a serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And yet there is another feature that puts the Legend of the Fighting Legion in the foreground of everyone else. That is, the film has not only a heroic music theme, but also lyrics, yes, the legionaries sing! We hear them in the opening credits and sing in several chapters! It works really well and contributes to the feelings we get from looking. <br /> <br /> When the show first appeared on our local television (circa 1955), all the gangs immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as part of 'Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the TV series. Mr. Hadley had a very strong, deep voice. *** He has mastered the role very well. His costume and especially the oblong mask looked very good and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a little slip-up. A sort of minor anachronism occurs when Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) speaks in front of the San Mendelito Council, since Juarez was about 18 at that time (1824) and although he was later perhaps the single greatest figure in Mexican history, surely not so well known. His inclusion in the story was probably a win in the release of Warner Brothers' JUAREZ this year, in which Paul Muni played the title role. <br /> <br /> This is not just my choice as a top 5 sound series. But also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We remember the great harvest of the best air films this year. With GONE WITH THE WIND goes MR.SMITH WASHINGTON, THE CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE WIZARD OF OZ, MICE AND MEN, ONE MILLION BC, ZENOBIA, WE WANT OUR MOM, ALL OF WHICH WERE ESTIMATED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez had no national significance in 1850, about 25 years later. Political subdivisions are also referred to in history as "provinces." In reality they are called "states". Just as we are called the United States of America, they call their Repubhlic south of the border also the United States of Mexico. Reed Hadley was very prominent in some A-pictures in that his rich voice is well utilized. Listen and listen to his story in THE HOUSE ON 92. STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
