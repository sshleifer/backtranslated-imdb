When the first came out, my dad brought it home - we loved it - it was so different from anything we had seen before. I searched for a particular movie last night and found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! These are not graphics looking for Nemo, but still very good. You should resell it - it's a milestone for computer animation images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> So it is: <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" is a spectacular odyssey through time. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and goes through the rise of man and technology. Travel into the world of abstraction and into the future with stunning computer animation images. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" brings together the imagination of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. This unique collaboration will take you on an incredible journey in The Mind's Eye.
