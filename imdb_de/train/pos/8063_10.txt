This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and John Ford's first Oscar winner is simply mesmerizing and impresses with an impressive Max Steiner score. Called an art film because Ford had very little money to make that great story of guilt and retribution, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film a classic is the direction and the amazing photography and the use of fog and light that is so different from ordinary American film, and more in the tradition of German Expressionism. And Victor McLaglen's Oscar winning performance as a drunken gypo is just incredible. Basically, the film takes place in Ireland, and Gypo uses a friend in the rebel movement to the English to raise 20 pounds for his girlfriend. But with all the money he starts blowing and giving a drunk all night while the leaders of the movement try to track down the informant. The whole movie is a night in a dark and foggy Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable, but the whole world of Gypo approaches him, both psychologically. If I had to select three directors to have ALL the movies on a lonely island forever, and no one else, John Ford would surely be one of them. What a really remarkable movie ...
