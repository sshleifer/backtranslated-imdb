I am very sorry that this charming and bizarre movie (which I first saw shortly after its first release in the early fifties) has been so poor lately. In my opinion it has been severely underestimated - but perhaps it is more about European humor than American (for example): maybe we can more fully understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations in Europe as we are closer to some of them in real life ! Especially noteworthy is the limited, but good music - especially the catchy and catchy song "It's a fine, fine night", which in the fifties separately on a HMV 78rpm plate (10-inch plum label, I think!) Was published. I would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you have the chance: you have a pleasant surprise.
