Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who did it right. <br /> <br /> This is Hamlet's only full-four-hour film. William Shakespeare's masterpiece gives the entire story a unique feel. <br /> <br /> Not many directors could do this without boring audiences, but Branagh's skilful use of brilliant film style and stunt casting allows people to recognize the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out. <br /> <br /> Examples include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose sole purpose in the film was simply to say "Yes, sir," as Polonius asks him to spy on Learte's. These included Billy Crystal as a grave digger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's performance of Group 4's fourth act (which is usually cut out) is nothing short of a kinematic miracle as the camera slowly recedes with increasing intensity. It's a scene that literally made me jump out of my chair and applaud. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understood the meaning of each scene in this film and could convey that meaning to the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must for anyone who likes the good story, the brilliant spectacle and the incredible direction. All these parts of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
