Recently, I was looking for the newly released Wide Screen DVD from FLY AWAY HOME and came across an interesting title that I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it is a Richard Attenborough film caught my attention (he was responsible for such good films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of interesting material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I thought about it and bought. IMPRESSIVE! What a nice movie. Pierce Brosnan plays a starring role as Archie Gray Owl, a real trapper in the 1930s who loved and respected the wild lands of Canada to protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond movie) gives a shady, warm, powerful performance, as does Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and influences his sense of the country's creatures, especially the beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and a beautiful photograph by Roger Pratt make a significant contribution to the film's effectiveness. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two 1930s shorts featuring the real Gray Owl and audio commentary by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts. 2 featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM capabilities. GRAY OWL was released directly to DVD in the United States - a fact that attributes Richard Attenborough to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not burdened with violence and sex. This is a movie that not only informs and entertains but also gives you something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the film - and a whole new love and understanding for beaver! GRAY OWL is a very fine film - worth a look! I'm looking forward to sharing with others.
