A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln's early years by director John Ford, which focuses primarily on a process in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. The film offers an interesting account of this important American figure and film are well done, but seem a little incomplete without the big moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man who developed the qualities that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that although I admired the presentation, it was not as satisfying as I think it would have been with more room for maneuver. In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry Fonda, who plays the role effectively shows a calm force. Fonda's performance includes some unpredictable behaviors and other affects that are quite effective in presenting a Lincoln performance, especially in combination with effective make-up and costumes that are occasionally overly open. <br /> <br /> The understudy is solid and, surprisingly, does not contain as many of Ford's regular cast members (sometimes referred to as its stock company), but we have Ward Bond, one of the most prolific character actors in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in more of the AFI Top 100 films than any other actor, both in the original and in the revised list. He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees. <br /> <br /> The film shows a scene that seems to have inspired a similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", in which it would be even better, though this scene is one of the most effective in this film ,
