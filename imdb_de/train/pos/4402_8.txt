After seeing all the films of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. in the 1950's, it's pretty exciting to see this movie with a new perspective from director Ang Lee. The scene of the attack by Lawrence, Kansas, is great. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best games and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as a villain. This movie lets you feel all the time about the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters, who do not know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
