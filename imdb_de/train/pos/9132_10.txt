I start by telling my first encounter with the music of Prince. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday, and a girl danced on the speakers until "1999". I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. Later I heard other Prince songs and really "dug" them. When Purple Rain came out, I knew very little about this Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I immediately became Prince No. 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later, I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she brought me and my nephew to a V.I.P. Prince's concert, where we sat next to his mother ... how cool is that! Returning to the subject, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who have called Purple Rain an instant classic. I have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought Prince was good, Apollonia had a bit of a fight, but all in all, it was good. John Gielgud was not available for The Kid, so Prince took over the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly in tact (he never gets slow) and is feverishly directed. I count it among the best movie musicals of all time. The last time I saw it was after about 7 years and it still delivered. I am so proud of the Minnesotan prince Rogers Nelson and would like to tell him personally. He went straight to me during the above concert and said "Hi" to my nephew but not to me. He talked to his mother. I was a bit crushed, but he is still the No. 1 in my life.
