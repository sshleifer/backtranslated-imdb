I usually stay away from TV movies because you know they're TV movies five seconds ahead of the picture. This drew my attention to the unusual title and the gloomy, well-made mood that has been established from the beginning. While the ubiquitous rain confirmed my suspicion of a misguided story (even though it was claimed to have been filmed in California, the film was mostly shot in a stormy Vancouver), the dark and oppressive nature complements Olmos' outstanding acting.
