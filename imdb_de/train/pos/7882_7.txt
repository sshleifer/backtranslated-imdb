"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to showcase the MGM talent. The film is a fun trip with an ocean liner on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time the country was involved in World War II. This was a typical price for the studios who made the film public in the difficult times the country lived as a slight distraction to the film. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is in some musical numbers at her best where she shows us clearly, she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton can also be seen in a straight section with not too much clowning, as he chases the beautiful Ms. Powell on the ship that brings her to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities to show in the movie that he was a jolly man. Even Virginia Gray is seen as a funny girl who is not deceived by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good music numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, including the amazing Buddy Rich who has some solos with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as a singer of the band, which is supported by the Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM commands completely.
