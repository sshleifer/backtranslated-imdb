FUTZ is the only show received from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (the beginnings of Off Off Broadway). While not for everyone, it's a truly brilliant, grim, funny, yet often deeply disturbing story of love, sex, personal freedom and revenge. A serious moral story that is even more relevant at a time when Congress wants to ban gay marriage by ruining our constitution. History, however, is not about being gay - it's about love and sex that do not conform to social norms and therefore have to be removed through violence and hatred. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any big fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger - to stifle conformity in America. <br /> <br /> The stage version gained international recognition in its original production, touring the US and Europe, and influencing almost all the theaters that followed it with others of its kind. Luckily, we kept the show as good as it originally, with the original cast and director Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary, easy-to-use studio drama - this is an aggressive, disturbing, glorious, deeply emotional, wild ingenuity that you will never forget. And it might just change the way you see the world ...
