I saw this for the first time as a child in East London. The scars of Hitler's air force were all too obvious and the landscape of the film reminded us of our street. I remember nightmares after seeing it. The strange thing is that it's really not dated when considered as a piece of social history in cinema fiction. <br /> <br /> Apart from a global destructive war, the scale of the machines was poor, more nano-technology, but overall excellent and well-made work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived at the time. I would think that firing a spacecraft with a gigantic weapon would almost certainly kill the astronauts. But many things were right. Mans desire for war, inhumanity of the people. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
