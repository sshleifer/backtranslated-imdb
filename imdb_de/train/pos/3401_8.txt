The groundbreaking Technicolor Cinematography (winner of the Special Oscar for Technical Achievements) is indeed enchanting. Add an endless selection of glamorous costumes and a romantic Cinema Dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a pretty enjoyable "picture". <br /> <br /> Blown action leaves something to be desired. However, to date there have not been any breathtaking Technicolor films (1936), and since then there are only a few left that can round off this stunning visual experience with breathtaking colors. Cinema fans who enjoyed the glorious color cinemas in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939) will not be disappointed by the fantastic work here. "The garden of Allah" will always be a synonym for brilliant color cinematography.
