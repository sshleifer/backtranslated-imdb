If you like romantic comedies, you'll find that story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race is satisfying. On the other hand, if you wait for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you probably should stay away. The action contains the obligatory man meeting girlfriends of a woman, a girl and a man's friend, and the husband meets scenes of girls' parents. There is even a man who meets a dog scene for girls. That's all in a movie like this. What I liked, though, was that the action that was divided into the decision-making process started when people began to realize that their romantic interest was not perfect and that it was actually a bit bizarre. The plot focuses on answering the questions; How much strangeness is too much and how much love does it take to surpass these idiosyncrasies? It's interesting to see that the characters work that way, because all of us have deep inside (if we admit it) quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon Sorta surprised me - he's good too. I rate it as 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you're a baseball fan or romantically involved. Add another point if you're a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you're a Yankees fan.
