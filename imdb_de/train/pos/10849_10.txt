This is perhaps the best rockumentary of all time - a British, better This Is Spinal Tap. The characters are believable, the plot is great and you can really empathize with some of the events - like Ray's adaptation problem. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Real stuff, even if it's in the same key, makes you hum some of the songs for a few days. What I liked was the almost British cast of some of the most popular names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never stretches, it just runs at the right pace and has some really funny sections. A generator of really good keywords! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
