Another test compared this squad with a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also fitting. Another review looked at the differences between the non-critical comedy and the black comedy, which are also worth considering. In the end, all the characters are tied together and the puzzle pieces fit together just as well as a Douglas Adams novel. The details and subtleties are amazing. Thoroughly postmodern. Wickedly funny and amazingly tragic. Not for children. Not for people with thin skin or objectivity. To be thought-provoking. Immediately verbal, figurative and surreal in a disturbing way. The blackest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And maybe the most beautiful thing I'll ever see.
