I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why she would cry in the last few minutes. Of course I found the whole movie funny, especially the behaviors of the characters. It was not until I was much older and saw it again that I realized how much deeper this show actually is. Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as reluctant mediators. Keaton fascinates me with his true line delivery style and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) is simply fabulous in her role as a comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated movies of the 80's. We can all learn a lesson from the fusion of American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you can really have "the best of both worlds". And now I understand why my mother felt like she did in those last moments. I would also prefer one of these cars.
