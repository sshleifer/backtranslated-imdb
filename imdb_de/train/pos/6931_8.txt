In 1955, five years after the release of the film, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had made six more films together, including four Westerns. Their relationship was obvious from the beginning, and what was only intended as a universal programmer became a cult and a classic. Buffs of the period will enjoy the fact that the first ten names of the credits were all well known - and that does not matter to Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, who later became Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the "psychological" West was well anchored, but in 1950 it was rare to bring Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, not to mention a few other problems along the way, and yet a conventional Western on the surface create and full appreciation for all involved. Add one to the DVD collection.
