This is the best of the 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; at least the most successful. After the Second World War he was one of the leading directors in New Germany. Hanna Schygulla was great when the cold, calculating Maria Bruan, who had lost her husband during the war, found him after taking an American soldier. As a lover, he lost him again after being sent to prison for her, and found him again in the end. Her one-and-a-half-day marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together. <br /> <br /> That's life. Things come and go and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust your mindset to survive. Although Maria considered her thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which is the end of such a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
