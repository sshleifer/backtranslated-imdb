If you, like me, have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin, do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life when he created Tintin. It's so awesome and a very cool production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also the many different situations that influenced him, for better and for worse, is amazing. There is a very subtle and obvious connection between the comics and this very one. I will definitely be back in my basement and dig up the Tintin albums again. The movie itself is also very well told and has a great surround sound. I really hope that people will find it just as fascinating as me!
