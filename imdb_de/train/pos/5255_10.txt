Tim Meadows was underestimated by the last cast members of SNL. What was initially a low-brack look at a sloppy Gigilo is evolving into a thoroughly entertaining 90-minute run, albeit still low-braow. Do not be fooled by a beautiful cinematography or Oscar-worthy performances. Go inside and expect a brilliant stupidity when Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell do what they do best - and make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, sympathetic radio sex show presenter very little about anything except the ways of Wang. A gifted Ladies Man, he wastes the wives of countless saps who banded together to hunt him down. The director does an inspirational job to accompany the actors on a comedy tryst, which completely overcomes the lack of plot development. How much plot would you expect from a SNL sketch? While some scenes are a bit off the mark, Meadows' one-liners and absurd sexual commentaries mostly directly hit the funny bone. In one scene, for example, Meadows compares to Mother Theresa just to think. Sure, it's blatant, but do not we all get a chuckle in the privacy of our homes around a town because it's supposed to do it "in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a hearty kiss with the female lead, he suddenly remembers the name of his wife, who was a benefactress, a woman he had slept with years ago. He stands in front of the woman who has obviously fallen in love with him and announces to her obvious annoyance that "The Ladies' Man is back." Billy Dee Williams hits the ball from the park bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, completes solid performances. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are interested in adult humor. If not, stay away from extreme prejudice.
