One of the few best films ever. The change from black and white to color for the celestial and earth sequences was of outstanding quality. <br /> <br /> The Plot is very clever, the entire movie leaves you overwhelmed by all the human emotions, a war movie it does not discriminate. I have to watch this movie more often than anyone else, and I never get tired. It's a movie in which you question your own mortality and conviction about what happens after we die.
