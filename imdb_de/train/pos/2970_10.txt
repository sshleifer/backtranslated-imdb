I thought baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It's funny humor that made me giggle all the way, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so exaggerated increases the comedy of the movie. <br /> <br /> I just bought baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies you never get tired of. I have a very short attention span and I think that this movie has such funny parts that I am talking through and through. The humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember later. <br /> <br /> So overall, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie everyone should see, especially when you're younger. I'll make you laugh for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> PS: Does anyone believe that I like them both? hehe
