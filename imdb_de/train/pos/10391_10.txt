It's very rare for a movie to appeal to audiences of all ages - children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful staging, and for adults a literary screenplay, fine production values, good casting / acting, all bound together with a fine Rozsa score. Two grossly contemporary films create this - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the background of this production is fascinating. This production began in the summer of 1939 in England, moved to Hollywood and was a cover for British intelligence. The producer Alexander Korda was then knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of overlapping art, commerce and politics! Make sure you get a good CD of this film for your library!
