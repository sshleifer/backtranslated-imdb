The Straight Story is a multi-level exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. On one level is a slow walk through the heartland, its friendly inhabitants and amber grain, on another level the aging and remembering of the essential (and the active forgetting, what not). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable movie that will stay with me for a while.
