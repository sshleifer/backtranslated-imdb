The movie itself made me call someone so he could enjoy it as well. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Julia. The parents are funny. They are both caterers and enemies. The children play the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the church. They fall in love and their parents try to separate them after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to marry at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and slander of classical literature, do not watch. If you do not mind, you have a great time watching this.
