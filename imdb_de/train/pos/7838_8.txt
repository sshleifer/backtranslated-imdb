If you're a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend checking this. It shows both a bizarre side of Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, who apparently had a good time shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but enjoy watching them, so you get to know them only People, and when the concert is shown, is a talented musician, playful and professional, who seems to be rocking and impressing the screaming girls. If you see him at the concert, you would never know it's a job to be a rock star, but it's just fun to play great songs with good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr, in some live performances occur. True, there are a few songs that I would have loved to see there, but like every album, it can not have everything. I just bought it in 2006, but if I had known that it came out in 1972, I would definitely have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs would never learn to drive a car about his love of cars and would die in a car accident!
