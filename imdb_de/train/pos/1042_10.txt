An American, her European husband and her children return to their mother in Watch on the Rhine, a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman's play, and with Paul Lukas (with whom I believe he is here his stage role repeated), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. As an anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, who is often injured and wanted by the National Socialists, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. He finds out, however, that there is really no escape, as one of the house guests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are great performances going on to expound Lillian Hellman's liberal stance. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time of its release, as the evils of war and what happened to people in other countries were enough to secure American homes. The big controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrey Bogart had a wonderful screen presence and a fantastic Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has the need to kill is crumpled, just to mention a scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what you think of as Bette Davis movie, here's a masterly performance of Kurt's faithful and loving wife, Sara. Her acting in the heart and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. The last half hour of the movie had torn from the honesty of emotions in tears. Lillian Hellman is not for everyone, but unlike "The Little Foxes," she has written some really likable, wonderful characters and a beautiful story that reflects A Warner Brothers' A castings and production values. Highly recommended.
