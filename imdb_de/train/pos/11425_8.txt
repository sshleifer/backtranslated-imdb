The story is about a little girl who grew up in colonial Africa, but it's so much more than that. Anyone who grows up in the south would experience the same things. A yearning for another, another race that can not be accomplished. Even a look is forbidden. No words are needed. Her facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so great that they torture each other because they can not have each other. <br /> <br /> The little girl France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the irritating aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonial masters. You can not even take off alone for bed. There the world ends; They just do not know it yet. Their racist attitudes are erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet. especially at night when you only hear the animals.
