This film is essentially about human relationships and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who, at dawn of her life, makes a journey into her past to analyze how she lived her life. This journey is being crushed by the sons' economic crisis and their intention to take them to a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some of the questions that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas that need to be discussed in this film, such as family heritage, true love, marriage, or destiny. Although this type of movie melodrama is nothing new, this can be helpful if you are looking at it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance from the actors and the characters are very believable, but due to the time some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
