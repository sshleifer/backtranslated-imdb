Guy Kibbee laughs a lot at the audience. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very underrated actor, is excellent at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the audience entitled to vote. A campaign based on no comment: "I take it under guidance" and "Maybe yes, but maybe no" is the near-perfect way to win an election. In short, the stupider the candidate is, the greater the chance that he or she will win. After all, the public can identify with such a person. In terms of the movie, it's a lot of comedy.
