When people ask me why I like movies, I usually answer, "Have you seen the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone is pretty much everything I want to see in a movie. If I was a film director, I would like to do that. "Pure Cinema" is a way to describe this sequence, and it's really amazing to see how director De Palma's entire film works with the same artistic frequency of this scene. It's a gorgeous movie, clever as hell and with more enthusiasm and intelligence than a dozen films. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: could a film rely solely on technology and still be regarded as an artistic success? The film has no message, the acting is great, but it serves the style, and the script lacks the logic. De Palma's film is a really good case if a style, if handled properly, supports a feature film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Keith Gordon are superlative, but this is a director's movie to hide. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I can not tell you which Hitchcock movie pays tribute to the movie (I do not want to ruin any surprises), but I think De Palma goes beyond history and he manages to create a movie that covers his entire career pretty much summarized. Not for the faint of heart!
