Creepy crime drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill," though it's not that polished. Nevertheless, it is a highly addictive, defective chaos over a Cambodian loner Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. As he fled from the scene, he kills the partner of police officer Sam Wai which to inflict insult, just to do with his dying father, and so Sam begins a mad, obsessive manhunt for Pang, which gives nearly a dozen corpses and relentless violence. Lately something in the air must be, because I've never seen so many people as they hack apart the flesh. This is grim, unpleasant stuff, which is why I'm so partisan, and I welcome his swooping mood. It looks visually exciting and the sound design is very unique. Everything turns down dramatically until each character finds himself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot in the pangs bond is involved in a sexually abused girl, gives the story depth and produces a surprising fourth act, which is characterized by a grotesque operation.
