WONDERFULLY ... I wish there would be a sequel to this documentary to follow the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others who were lost ... there should be a second part ... a real one. It was great ... the movie was not long enough ... I would like to know why the movie designer was not pursued !! This is so important for community time. If you are reading this you should consider another documentary of this kind. I am really tired of hearing from naive authors how AIDS and men come together when they do not. Actually, it is the heteros that we need to investigate. This movie did not even bother mentioning HIV or AIDS, and I was so happy about it. I really appreciated the breakdowns and definitions. Thank you for letting this movie exist.
