No movies caught my attention like this one. You see, I wanted to see this movie again for over 25 years. The only time I saw it was a teenage boy released in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember about the movie is that it touched these deeply felt emotions so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to see it again. The intrigue that this film offers through the human element of searching and seeking from Father / Son will touch anyone who observes it. I do not know why this movie is not taken out of memory and shown as often as many other films of lesser depth. <br /> <br /> Postscript: Received movie copy and after looking back at it, she was thrilled that my memory was true. The rating reflects the content of the movie. I would like to see this movie on DVD, because this 1977 production on a used VHS cassette has affected the overall quality.
