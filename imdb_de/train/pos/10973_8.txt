A great movie that shows the miserable life of two nutty old ladies. They could not live together or live apart from each other. Sometimes they babbled constantly, sometimes at the same time, and rekindled the past; on and on about what could. I sometimes laughed, but mostly I was overwhelmed by how sad and abandoned these two women were. See this one.
