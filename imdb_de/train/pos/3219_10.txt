This is a great movie. It has a gripping story, a great main character, very good acting and killer action. This usually takes place in 2036, but shows scenes that took place in recent years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier by the name of Todd who was trained to kill from birth and like all other soldiers never had a normal life. Finally, the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. That's why they do not need old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by fighting some of the old soldiers. In the battle Russell is injured and considered dead. The military is pouring his body and a few, provided they're all dead, but they do not know Russell is alive. Todd finds a civilized camp on this planet as the military spilled it on. He lives there for a while, but can not adapt to normal life. He rarely says a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. If they feel he is a danger to them, send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> As Russell's planets leave the planet, they are attacked by the new soldiers. The military forgot to train the soldiers to be as smart as Todd and the other old soldiers. While these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd trumps them easily. The military realizes that and Todd kills all men except one. This is Jason Scott Lee and at the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell is obviously at the top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and seen a lot. This has everything you can expect in a movie, including some great lines. The writer has also not forgotten that Russell had never seen a woman, since he even called women as "sir". There are no holes in this movie, every minute has a purpose and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> A fantastic one-man action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended to all Kurt Russell fans and action / science fiction fans.
