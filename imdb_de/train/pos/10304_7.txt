"Bruce Almighty" looks incredibly stupid, especially from the followers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message, which actually interested me more in this film. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and gets divine powers from him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized here as God, and although it is not his usual type of movie or one of his best roles, he is excellent with what he has been provided. The film is a bit rough at times, but he laughs a lot, from Bruce, who divides his soup in half, like the Red Sea, and the customer's reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly relaxed and clever image of God. It is sometimes exaggerated and there is some gross humor, but overall it is a bit funny. There is a decent minor cast like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film turns out to be very romantic and rousing, and the message is clear that we should do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle". The film is far from perfect, but still pleasing and far better than I and many people would have expected, especially when we see the deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** from ** **
