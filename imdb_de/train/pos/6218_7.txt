79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything but great movies. Although not one of the best, it is an excellent musical. There are some excellent musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, provide memorable early screen appearances. Ball is especially good and also a blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best songs of the musical duo. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of Ozzie and Harriet, plays Ginger Roger's sister. The basic plot is pretty familiar, but it works with an extraordinary cast. Excellent Art Direction and Score.
