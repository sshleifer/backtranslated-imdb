Here's another beauty in the series of beautiful films by Eytan Fox. The film shows the story of lovers with star cross (an Israeli, a Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film is based not only on the representation of ethnic conflicts, but also on personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a moment when one of the secondary characters, who is openly gay, is being washed around the room by his friend, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his host family. Obviously, the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family does not accept her the way he wants, while the friend is confused and rejected. Much complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective in the equitable way in which it presents the mutual brutality inflicted on Israelis and Palestinians. If you are not without a heart, you cry until the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and played that it reminds us how satisfyingly good melodrama can be.
