I personally liked this movie and am alarmed by the rating that some people have given. It's a movie based on a comic book and it's animated. Of course, if you do not like comic books or animations, you will not like this movie. However, if you're a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women kicking their asses and saving the world (hell), you'll love this movie. I thought the story really got me involved and it was a really cool movie. Quite anime-like or more like some of the American films following this new adult entertainment trend. As with titanium A.E. meet is the live action version of Punisher. In the end, I recommend this movie to the comic fan and superhero fan or anyone looking for a fun movie.
