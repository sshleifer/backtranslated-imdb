The summary of this movie explains what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Good Shot It was hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots look exactly like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are a few settings that look really good and show a little imagination of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists in the end, some believable, all funny and, above all, good enough to turn them around. <br /> <br /> Even the children actors of the movie are great. Normally, I scramble to star in movies with kids because Nickelodeon rejects them all too often, but both kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bloody. It is not very scary. But it is very, very scary.
