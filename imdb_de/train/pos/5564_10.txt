The best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all the Cheech and Chong this is the safest so far. I think I've seen them all at least twelve times and I love them all. But that's definitely the best. Compared to the others, many topics are covered here and you will have a lot of fun. Some of the texts are still part of our language after 25 years. I hope they can make a new one someday because they are still great comedians. I heard you write a new script. Who knows? I wonder if John Ashcroft ever saw any of them ...
