well done, giving the perspective of the other side, frail doctor captures both the cost and the futility of war. Excellent acting, especially when the German High Command has punished the upcoming medal emperor in the name of chivalry. The slaughter scenes are probably too intense for mature US heads, who probably prefer stupid speeches and pointless abstractions like 14 points or the League of Nations. Real Americans may appreciate the storyline and the action. Fraulein Doctor compares favo (u) favorably with Jacob's Ladder.
