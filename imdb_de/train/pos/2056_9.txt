I do not think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror films, and that makes the cake, especially for originality. Yes, the scarecrow is a kung-fu warrior, but why not? Nobody else is ready to go that far. I really have not had so much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the city attacks that one kid who calls him Scarecrow, even his mother does not care about him. Then he is killed and the ghost is poured into the scarecrow, which then makes a murder rush. His downfall is relatively easy to assume once the movie is up and running. The dedications at the end go straight to a number of horror directors, but with the greatest commitment to Dario Argento I felt really cool. Over the course of the movie, there's a lot of Arnold rip-off, with a liner that will definitely make you laugh, and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza, make friends and laugh with this movie. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
