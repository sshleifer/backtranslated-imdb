I ask someone who says he is not interested in this movie. Some critics said that there was not enough action, others said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The acting performances are outstanding! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all great and Liam Neeson does an admirable job and is a very impressive character due to his size. Cinemap photography was brilliant and breathtaking. It's one of the few films I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that was virtually flawless when performing casting, directing, writing, acting, and so on. t In the top 50 or 100 tested films. I felt so passionate that I just registered with IMDB so I could all know what that is. I've watched this movie about 10 times (each time with another person) and everyone loved it! You need to be awake and watch it carefully for the first 30 minutes, as they introduce some characters at the beginning. If you have the attention longer than most of these Juvenile kids who write reviews for the movies on this website, you will love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix on # 32?!?! That should show you the age group of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is a Top 50 movie !!!
