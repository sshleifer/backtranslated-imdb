When I met Delirious for the first time, I just heard it. I listened to all the comedy performance and never laughed in my life. Eddie's ability to paint funny pictures and make great imitations is fascinating. When I finally saw him perform this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! Since this is the new millennium, his acts in 1983 are as funny today as they were then. My parents loved it as a teenager, and I (18 years old) love it too. From then on, I had to watch Murphy's other films like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
