This film has rewritten the history of film in every respect. Nobody cares what someone thinks about this movie because it goes beyond criticism. Any flaw in the movie can easily be overcome by the many amazing things the movie offers. It's an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see it again. I've seen it more often than I would like to count, and I'm still fixated on a feeling that's hard to describe. One for eternity.
