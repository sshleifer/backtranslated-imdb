This is my favorite movie by Jackie Chan, and in an interview, Jackie said it was also his favorite. It contains some incredible stunts and breathtaking combat sequences as well as some very funny scenes. This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also raised in Tango and Cash, where some of the opening scenes were used. Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong. The story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a miserable town and continues as Jackie slips down a hill and jumps into a moving bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the biggest villains in every Jackie Chan movie) - very funny scenes when Jackie tries to balance his job as a police officer with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect the secretary of Ku, who has enough information to turn it off, but even that raises many problems. Jackie is in great shape here. The last fight scene in the mall is my favorite fight scene of all - period. It was the fiercest fight I've ever seen when Jackie came in and climbed down in a pole between exploding lights. All in all, one of his biggest stunts he ever did, peeling off the skin from his hands. He was fortunate enough not to be electrocuted because the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage. All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his best films. At the end of this movie, you can say that he did not hold back anything and his stuntmen did not. So many of his stuntmen were injured in this movie that nobody would assure them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility himself. There are no gadgets, wires or proxies - it's all real life to watch. This kind of action made him the phenomenon he is, and it's a movie that will astonish people in 100 years. If you have not seen this movie before and are generally a fan of Jackie Chan, you should watch this movie. It is really sensational.
