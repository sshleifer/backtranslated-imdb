<br /> <br /> There is a STAR TREK canon - lots of it. From the canon we know the story of the future. Advances in technology, events, locations, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> COMPANIES are pretty much out of touch with ST-Kanon. An unfortunate fact for longtime serious fans. I assumed that the producers would at least watch the first TOS episodes and look back from there - but no, much more modern than found in TOS. A Starfleet old-style laser pistol, a slow golden speckle-transport effect - that was what I expected. I also did not expect to hear pure, beep-based sound effects similar to TNG, but far from TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE) we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect - something of the Earth's ancient navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for the rank. The cartoon STAR BLAZERS contains more military code than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It's okay that Captain Archer is unsure of the needs of the universe (unlike Kirk, who has never lacked faith in the application of human justice), but in ENTERPRISE everyone seems equal his. Unprofessional, insecure, more remote from the sense of formal military service than in any ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> The informal Country Opening theme song announces a family's travels to the adventures of a major military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE shows us a mostly fun, blurry exploration of human relationships, rather than taking us on a historic, daring, earthy exploration space. <br /> <br /> I chose Adrian Paul as captain and an elderly person as a doctor. Still, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, a great dancer at Boston College, is sure to be doing well. The characters that make up the crew seem to have been thoughtfully created. ENTERPRISE starts its run more strongly than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
