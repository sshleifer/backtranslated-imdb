I was one of many who expected to see a transfigured yankee doodle dandy portrayal one day, which (as we know) should live in shame rather than fame. How was I wrong? These people were right in the middle and the pictures they brought back are amazing and heartbreaking. And yet, everything happened on a random trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Two French filmmakers had created a documentary about life as a NY firefighter, especially from the point of view of a young beginner coming through the ranks. In the beginning, we see a lot of this footage to remind us that a movie about terrorism was not thought of. It should be a film about regular people who earn honest lives by helping others, and the beauty of the movie is that it never loses that advantage. <br /> <br /> While investigating a suspicious gas line (I think the memory is a little hazy), we suddenly hear a plane fly over us. The camera pulls up and shows a commercial jet that is torpedoed in one of the towers. What must the cameraman have thought at this time? The FDNY recognizes the importance of the material on which the camera remains and may possibly realize the same so that the camera can follow them into the building. <br /> <br /> What follows is a real view from the front. We see the commitment of the FDNY, its reactions (the stunned silence after the first person has died to death), and the collapse of a building from within, while a second camera captures the events from the FDN outside. <br /> <br /> If the horrible event they were about to report was not, the footage alone would be the dream of every young doctor. The footage just deserves to be preserved for all time. But what truly distinguishes this film is the sincere humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters rushing in without hesitation, people of various races helping each other to flee to a wave of rubble, and even the filmmakers' concern for themselves (they are brothers) as they can not reach confusion. There are amazing sights and amazing human stories in this movie, something that Hollywood could never duplicate (though it's tried). <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a movie about politics. It's not a film about religion, nationality or even jihad. 9/11 is a movie about people and a true reference to the best and the worst we are capable of. 9/11 is simply one of the most important films I've ever seen, and would be the only film born of this event if it were up to me. You can not copy that.
