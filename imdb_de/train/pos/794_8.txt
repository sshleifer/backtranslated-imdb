I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was differentiated and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell movie did not turn her beauty into another character in the movie. The romance between Kate and her young man is beautiful to look at and she is doing very well. Her relationship with her friends is a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who has worked as MVP in so many British films, is doing a great job. There is a tragedy, but I think the film is ultimately saved by the brilliant acting, the clear direction and the witty writing.
