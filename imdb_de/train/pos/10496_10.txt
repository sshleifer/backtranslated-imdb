Great actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, a stunning backdrop, a good, strong story, and more laughter as you fit into my new purse (and that's pretty big). This movie was brilliant. It was beautifully played in the serious scenes and the funny moments were. Well, split laterally. I've never heard a movie audience hear so much laughter, and tears ran down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop. Well done for the British film industry and for Craig Ferguson whose magical ingredients made this one of my favorite films of the year, if not all times.
