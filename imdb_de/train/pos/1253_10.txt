This well-designed and carefully researched documentary describes the appalling case of the Chagos islanders, who were forcibly returned from their homes between 1969 and 1971 through collusion between the British and US governments. Anglo-American politicians decided to act because they believe that the islands would be strategically important bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of aviation and naval power. In a Cold War era, when most of the new independent postcolonial states moved away from the Western orbit, British and American authorities had the impression that the islanders could not decide the fate of the islands. Instead, they opted for the compulsory complete removal of the native population. The film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the time of their ejection and that the displaced Chagosian community had been deprived of their port of call in Mauritius for three decades and was plagued by homesickness in these new circumstances they suffered greatly increased death rates. <br /> <br /> After more than three decades, but in recent months (and years), many of the most damaging papers have been published by the UK Public Record Office (it is more likely that there was a mistake, and this one Papers should never have been published.) The resulting appeals of the Chagossi exile community have shown that British courts have consistently been sought in favor of the islanders and the British state. Therefore, the astonishing and disturbing conclusions drawn in the film can only reasonably be considered proven. Nevertheless, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have so far not undertaken to return the islands to the legal residents definitively established by the courts. This is a very rewarding movie that anyone can see, but it's an important movie for the UK and Americans. In the face of these facts, one has to engage in a thoroughly ugly crime.
