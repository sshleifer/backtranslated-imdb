In August 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the lawsuit against her parents Lindy and Michael caused a riot in the then very angry nation over the alleged murder of the child. The media and the public had already brought the accused married couple to justice and sentenced. There followed a serious miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that a dingo camping out near Ayers Rock, central Australia, had their ten-week-old daughter pulled out of the tent as they prepared to eat in the barbecue area. Nobody believed them. Lindy was charged with murdering her baby, and Michael as an accessory afterwards. The whole country was full of whispers of a ritual murder. The case against Chamberlain was over before it started. Lindy never proved her innocence why she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict them, but the jury was influenced by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in court? How could we know where we came from? If there was no absolute proof and there were no reasonable doubts about it, the Chamberlains would have had to be acquitted. Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and fully confirms the argument of John Bryson's novel that the Chamberlains were completely innocent charged against them. That, indeed, a dingo had taken the baby Azaria on this fateful night in Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi brilliantly captured the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, with hell pressing for "the truth" to come to light. He shows Australia in a rather unfortunate light as a nation totally obsessed with paying the Chamberlains! His screenplay, co-written with Robert Caswell, deeply touches emotions and will certainly find the audience saddened and upset by the Justicestraw effort. <br /> <br /> The eminent Meryl Streep offers an incredible performance accused of the most frightful deeds. Most convincingly, she brings to life the tough little Aussie who was ready to withstand the accusations and fix the world. Even her accent is almost, but not exactly. A very good effort of the master of this craft. Sam Neill is as good as Streep, like the first faithful but then disillusioned Michael, who can not understand why their world is falling apart, and he begins to question his Christianity. His and Streep's are witnesses of great emotional power that will deeply move you. The entire cast is also excellent. Some of the best Australian actors and actresses play a role. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is also brilliant. Ian Baker, director of photography, conquers this great country with superb rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the movie tense and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton delivers a revealing score. For all Australians, this is a must, a shocking look in the mirror, if you want what We have done as a country with a family that wanted justice to be served and the truth known. As Michael Chamberlain said, "I do not think anyone really understands what innocence means ... for innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that had befallen the Chamberlains who lost baby Azaria at Ayres Rock in 1980 , is still emotionally powerful and genuinely moving at the reunion visits. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell did manage to put John Bryson's novel on the silver screen and tell in simple terms the terrible story of a vacation that had gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, their newborn daughter Azaria only moments away was brought from the family tent after their defeat by a dingo. <br /> In the midst of media speculation and vicious public rumors, Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was subsequently charged as an accessory. What followed was nothing more than a media lawsuit, and when the Australian people decided to get rid of them, Lindy was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, although the prosecutor's office is not motive and little else than evidence for the evidence could. <br /> Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who is going against Australia to prove her innocence. She's really great, and the only thing she can not do is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does everything she can to sound ocher. You may be wondering why an Australian top actress was not cast in the role, but Starpower is probably the answer. In addition to Meryl, Sam Neill is just as impressive as the husband, who collapses his world before his eyes, while powerless to do something about it. A strong Aussie cast provides convincing support. <br /> <br /> The editing of Jill Bilcock is very recent, Ian Baker's cinematography of rock and other rugged places is visually brilliant and the music of Bruce Smeaton is perfect for the part. A must for all conscientious Australians. Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
