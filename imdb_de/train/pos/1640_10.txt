"Heartland" is a wonderful depiction of what it really was like to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to weather the rigors of the climate and the lack of medical care mingle with the fellowship and mutual dependence of the settlers. The drama was particularly significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see how the West was inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or looked like he'd just spent a session with the make-up or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming at the beginning of the 20th century and did not put any effort in their new life in a new country.
