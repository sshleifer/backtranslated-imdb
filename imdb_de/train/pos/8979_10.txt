I loved this movie, at first the smooth graphics with the grainy films seemed weird, but I quickly got into it. It must have been recorded thousands of hours, and I really admire the work done in reducing the work. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but there are some great characters here (and some real thugs). Technically, I liked it very well, they had to use a new de-interlacing algorithm or it was just that the material looked so dark anyway. (Open Water has driven me crazy, mostly because there are now inexpensive, progressive cameras and I see no excuse for not shooting if you intend to see them in the cinema). Sorry, that's my own little cry. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever had anything to do with the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most are weird. I'm accused of laughing at others' misfortunes, but it's a classic piece.
