I have chosen this product based on the recommendations on this website. I have to say, it was worth it. However, you should make sure that this movie runs for 210 minutes. If you do not have the stamina you need, tape it up and watch it over a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie, what I'm saying includes "spoiler" and if not, here's: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an elderly woman named Marie. Marie owns a store and she takes care of Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story shows that Alex Gilberte, with whom he used to live, had previously impregnated. Gilberte dismissed him for a less attractive husband she did not love because Alex abused and abused her. At this point, Alex was ready to get a job and raise her child before finding out that Gilberte had broken it off and planning to marry another. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a nurse-nymph named Veronika and they've made a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the dirty sex she had had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have a threesome to offer. In the end, it's finally clear that Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume that Alexandre (as described in Gilberte's situation) will even get a job and become the provider of his newly found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Maman et la putain", I exclude that Jean Eustache referred to Françoise Lebrun's character Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. So mother and whore are the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, bland, lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played well with their disturbed characters and kept the film together as part of the script became somewhat lost and disconnected. <br /> <br /> No bad effort. 10.7.
