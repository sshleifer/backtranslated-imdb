I just want to say that I've seen this movie twice now and I love it! Acting is great, and although it's a similar act to Raise Your Voice, I think the action never gets boring for people who like it. It has some great lessons and shows us that we can do anything if we try. An incredible movie. I am sure that I will observe this for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is a fairly realistic plot, perhaps not about the part of the love, but the part to be different and fight, but in the end to get out the best, is very realistic. The only small criticism is why the main girl in these films is always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she had been ugly or average? I doubt that..
