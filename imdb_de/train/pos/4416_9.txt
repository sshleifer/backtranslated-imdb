Harvey Keital's best performance so far in the new century. Beautifully photographed, a nice snapshot of Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local chief criminal who joins a friendship with an American with Hollywood relationships. It really is the moment in which a boy awakened to the fact that the small circle of people he knows, actually living in a much larger, more complex world he does not understand is crisp. A really professional job that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The weakness is the decision more in sync English as to rotate in Spanish - is likely to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately that makes the movie a bit less convincing. But if you can look beyond that, you will find an intimate journey into another world. Recommended.
