After crossing this movie on a lazy Friday afternoon in the Fox movie channel, I can not imagine a better way to spend a lazy Friday night than to redeem my two cents. Especially if you consider the lack of user comments. Does not every film, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie like April Love, you should first remember the era it came from, in this case the late fifties. Films were pretty happy at the time. The cinemas were free of tragedies, while the screens were filled with Technicolor widescreen movies, to crowd people in a box called TV on the gray glow of the evil medium. I do not know how many people were exposed to the boob tube to see them, but I managed to get my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager He was sent abroad to his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and his uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) after being stolen for a car had been put on probation. It seems his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed seems to have lost his love of life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick, who is on the farm, somehow bring Jed out of his descent. Stories like these are what they are. Of course, Jed and Nick are not really interested in each other. Jed then meets neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately, Jed is in love with Fran, and of course I do not have to tell you that Liz is in love with Jed. Then there's the matter of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who has gone wild and will not bother anyone since the death of Jed Jr. You would probably be able to judge for yourself what is happening from this point, as there are no real surprises. Anyway, you will enjoy yourself anyway. <br /> <br /> If you've gotten over the image of squeaky, clean Pat Boone as a supposedly bad boy, you will not have any problems with the rest of the family movie. Given this, Boone does a surprisingly good job as Nick. Of course, the role does not require much depth, but it is still a good job if you least expected it. As Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the early stages he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to Nick, we see he's really a pretty good guy. Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun as Henrietta, who is constantly acting as an intermediary between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets some opportunities to pay tribute to her singing talent. As Liz she is beautiful to look at, great to hear and sometimes quite funny. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit wilder, is equally entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real evil captivating character on the screen. Not a true villain in the whole thing. Everyone is so damn sympathetic that you can just enjoy the movie. I think it's really refreshing, like leaving your worries behind and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with music numbers, something more action and widescreen technicolor. The songs are a mixed mix, with the title song April Love being the best of them. I also liked that they did not go back to bluescreen scenes during the race sequences, and they were a little more entertaining and exciting. In fact, you find the whole movie beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they were not nibbled in this department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all, the aversion between Nick and Jed is portrayed as everyone tries to win the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This movie is never mistaken for great cinema. But sometimes you do not just have to drive to Disneyland, you just have to make a nice trip in the park, and that's what April Love is all about. <br /> <br /> My degree: B +. <br /> <br />
