It's a shame she did not get the onscreen credit. She did by far the best work in the movie, the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. She almost made S / M laugh. She was really believable, the S / M model is afraid of her situation. Although they seemingly had the dreamy feeling of being on the lookout for evil, these sets were very well built, but they somehow covered the surface of the shot. This is a movie where both cuts should be made available. It seems she left out much of what was filmed, and almost all the really dark stuff that made the movie a whole lot crazier. It's like they did not reach the mark they were aiming for during the shoot. What was filmed would not have received an R rating, probably an NC-17 or an X, but that would require it to make the movie look like it should have been.
