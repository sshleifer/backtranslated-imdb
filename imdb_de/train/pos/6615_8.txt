I am glad that I could almost only say positive things about the film with Karas and the Tasuiev-sisters RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And first, that it looks like it should look like; RENAISSANCE is an adventure for boys. He tells the investigation of a police officer in search of a missing young scientist? Ilona Tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher of Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane is less known than SIN CITY, the better movie and the one more appreciated by connoisseurs. It will be even more meaningful to lovers of French comics (I enriched my collection of French comics last week, though I'm not that up to date). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines and the plot are all nice and lovable. A top Parisian policewoman Karas is shown to find a young woman who was a rising star in medical genetic research, Ilona Tasuiev, a mildly hot blonde whose rebellious sister Bislane was erotically preferred. <br /> <br /> For me, an oldie lover of comics and TV series, RENAISSANCE, a wonderfully beautiful cartoon, was like a repeat of a WILD WILD WEST episode - here was a mythological past through an equally mythological future detached and blasé but in a sense as exciting. RENAISSANCE is not exciting; it does not look too good either; but it is seductive and hypnotic. In addition, it sketches, albeit briefly, a world, a true world, and we will reflect on Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, the Tasuiev sisters and Goran, Farfella and Karas, who tell of his distant childhood in the Kasbah , , I liked RENAISSANCE's sense of gentleness, friendliness and adventurousness as well as the professional, confident look. Among these new cartoons, this and Linklater's Dick adaptation (the only and first Dick adaptation ever) were beautiful and exciting work. <br /> <br /> I thought the futuristic devices would be the appropriate and, though not conventional, vividly eerie (like the invisibility costumes). <br /> <br /> How advisable, the characters have exotic names like Bislane and Farfella, which mainly come from the world of the arts and entertainment (Goran and Ilona) and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> Nobody seems to notice that the RENAISSANCE poster has a Rourke-like look. This guy is Marv. That does not make it a SIN CITY rip-off, nor a model of originality, and in fact, it's more like Miller's story - the sombre futuristic look of a dilapidated society, the Hero's Hero (actually a cross between Willis' Character and Rourkes persona in the previous movie ??) On the other hand, this cartoon breathes more publicity, an edge of straightforward adventure, and in a word it's like SIN CITY for kids - well, I mean naughty kids because of a bit of nudity is. From what I have said, one could say that the features mentioned are characteristic, even as clichés and ordinary places of futuristic, adult comics. That's right, and it was Oldie Miller that these things were brought to the screen and RENAISSANCE has some similarities here and there. Now it is also fair that every RING must have its ERAGORN, so for every sinful city their renaissance. I admit to being confronted with these gloomy futuristic narratives, a fairly undemanding specialty.
