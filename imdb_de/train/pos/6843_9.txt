Writer and director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films wrongly called "Hitchcock Imitations." Contrary to popular belief De Palma Hitchcock does not tear off. He lends himself to stories or character elements that were seen in a Hitchcock movie and expands them in a more violent, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known to mix blood-soaked death with macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", which has existed since 1980, is perhaps the best-known Hitchcockian movie by De Palma. and it's probably his best, too. The story features a cross-dressing serial killer who pursues both a burned-out housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street hooker (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, it will clearly remind you of "Psycho", but De Palma's film is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative. The museum sequence is especially well rated and edited; The lift stitch scene is also one of the most unique murders ever made on film. "Dressed to kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it's definitely worth it. Rated with R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
