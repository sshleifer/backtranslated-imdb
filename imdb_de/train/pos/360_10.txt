11 Oscar nominations and zero victory !!! I still do not understand why - it's not that the actors in the movie are doing better after that, that you can do it by giving them prizes for trivial roles, as they were done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah , Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - I'm curious to get screenplays of the discussions at the Oscars this year ... it should go into the category "shoulda-woulda-coulda" for the judges ... < br /> <br It's an amazing book - but in the style of Alice Walker's writing style, it looks like it's exaggerating her characters - so I'm glad they've taken a few things by tweaking the screen. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes leave something to be desired - the African part of the book is supposed to take place in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think of Africa outside of safaris - so there had to be a zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there is no West Africa - and most of all, why people speak Swahili --- who speaks Swahili in West Africa? I just had to get rid of that ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, filmmaking - not of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <I own it and watch if my soul needs to be rejuvenated.
