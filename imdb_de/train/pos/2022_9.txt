The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexual. Things that were only suggested in the novel are shown on screen for some reason. Did you think the public would be too stupid not to understand it if you had not shown everything correctly? That being said, this is of very good quality. All the actors do wonderful jobs that bring their characters to life. For the shallow women out there it's worth it, at least since Toby Stephens is the sexiest thing ever as Gilbert. If I were Helen, I would have conveniently forgotten that I was still married when I looked at him.
