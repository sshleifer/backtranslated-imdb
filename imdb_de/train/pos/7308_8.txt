With a simple story and a captivating heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings to mind a pervasive nightmare on Halloween night when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of dastardly fun. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers fled from a near fallaci ... After slaughtering his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now in Haddonfield, the sleepy town of Illinois, where his murder took place. As soon as he looks at Laurie, after taking a parcel to the abandoned house where he lives, he begins to persecute and terrorize her. Her night of fun is terrified as he picks up everyone on his way to get to her. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting make this atmospheric horror movie really scary ... With the long, gloomy settings it feels like you're being followed by the maniacal serial killer himself. Myers is well hidden until completely revealed at the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly outdated, it's no less shivering. The idea is just goosebumps, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror films ever made. This resulted in seven sequels and finally Rob Zombie's equally terrifying remake and set a new standard for horror that still exists today.
