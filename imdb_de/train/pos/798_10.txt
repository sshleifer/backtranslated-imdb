This excellent drama kept me busy all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second, because every word connected the pieces with this mysterious murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. In the end I really cried (which I do not want to reveal!). I also realized how cruel and disgusting people can be in murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad actor was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I say that because he found someone who does not look like Anne Marie Fahey.
