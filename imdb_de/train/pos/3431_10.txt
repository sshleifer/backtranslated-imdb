Simply the best Estonian movie I've ever seen, even though it was made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a few gangsters trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. At the same time it is a kind of summary of the states of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union collapsed and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions in most of these countries may be better. In the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had inherited. (And many of them still do ... at least on some level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that time, with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovsky's Solaris), an old gangster who is getting tired of his way of life. But the most amazing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child actress who plays Terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is essential. (And her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credit list !!!) There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does. Unfortunately, the other films by Järvi-Laturi are far from these achievements. His first, Kotia päin, was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night - was just a weird mess.
