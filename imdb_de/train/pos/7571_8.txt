This game has ranked so far. I had the honor to play mine on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice output was above the standard. The difficulty is just right. Wesker must, in my opinion, be the best character of the RE series. The story surprised me and took many different turns that I did not expect. The only rating this game deserves is great.
