Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you must see. It felt very much to my heart's content and had a lot of humor that drew you straight into it. It's just like the real life the teens have to go through. Victor, a naughty teenager, but in the end a good heart, is about love in the right places when it comes to girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use. I really use it too. That's how much feeling this movie has. A heartfelt moment was when Victor's grandmother throws the winner over something simple. Victor really was a heart and could not believe that she would do such a thing. I was really sorry for him, as if it really was. Overall, I give this movie a B +
