For some of us who were born in the early post-war years, this film is of almost generational importance (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and liked to spend the Saturday afternoons in your neighborhood home). And the memory of seeing it probably stayed with you.

The set consisted of a city with a supermarket and a cinema, which was to be filled for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and a rebellious youth, but in "Why can not they make us have fun" and not as a disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-cause. All characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the police - were nice to us. We could all relate to them. <br /> <br /> It had a terribly unique monster. It's the first victim heard, "It hurts ... it hurts," and we were confident and scared. The threat continues to grow throughout history. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, a fantastic lead in McQueen and moments of humor, both intended and not. It even had a downright sad part to make the most sensitive of us cry. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in the summer, around the age of 9, and with 'I Married A Monster' double billed from Outer Space 'and was so excited about the experience of this special dual feature that I came back a few more times before I left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.
