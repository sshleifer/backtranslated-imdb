Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) is bored with his daily routine, limited to hard work, and stays at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenage daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of a dance school, and a few days later he decides to attend school and secretly take dance lessons every Wednesday night , He is ashamed, however, to tell his family his secret. In the meantime, Masako senses the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and looks with a private eye to see if Shohei has an affair. <br /> <br /> I just got "Shall We Dansu?" and I really loved it. What a beautiful and adorable movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed by the cold beauty and grace of director Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. Last September 6th, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and I found it a delightful conversation. But now I can say that it is another unnecessary remake and I recommend this original movie instead. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
