This is by far one of my favorites among American pie spin-offs, mainly because the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example AP: The Naked Mile. They have a teenager surrounded by naked college chicks, and have a particularly hot man on his trail to free him from his virginity problem, and he ends up in the middle of the act and rides a horse back to join his girlfriend sleep that they keep In his mind he gave him a "debt-free passport" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole, but let's be realistic; Most people who watch these films are not particularly looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the latest edition seems to realize who the public is, good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell roses, and as always, Mr. Levenstein gives the equation its "absolutely natural" eyebrow humor and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
