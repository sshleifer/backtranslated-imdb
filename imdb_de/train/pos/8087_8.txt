There just seems to be two types of reviews of this movie on the net. Those who hate and curse call Ralph Bakshis and they love it and call it awesome. I tend to be in the middle. I am forced to agree to most of the criticisms of this film (such as the cruel tailoring of the story, badly rotoscoped characters, actors, etc.). Nevertheless, I still love this movie. The rotoscoping (if done right) adds a sinister, realistic dimension to the characters and the final fight scene at the end of the film is fantastic. The surrealistic scenes in which the Nineriders chase Frodo are stylish and well done, and the musical score ... magical. Unfortunately, the bad points are overweight movies, but if you can get them to ignore them, this is a great movie review, well, that's life)
