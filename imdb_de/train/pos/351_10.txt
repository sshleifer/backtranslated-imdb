It's a colorful slasher movie. That's it. <br /> <br /> It's the mystery that made SCREAM so popular in Slasher movies, but I'm never interested in such things. Finding out who the bad guy is is not so interesting, considering that the clues are misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> The death scenes were imaginative and gorey, and evoked memories of horror movies of the 80s like Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing in this movie is that it's hard to locate the surviving girl, as opposed to SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was apparent. <br /> <br /> People who do not like Slasher movies will not like this movie. It's that simple. I really enjoyed it and I plan to look at it again while I wait for more of it. <br /> <br /> --MB
