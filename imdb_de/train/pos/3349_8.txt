Man With the Gun is now pretty much forgotten, but in 1955 Robert Mitchum unleashed a small storm of media interest, dismissing both Jett Rink in Giant (who had actually been written for him and later fundamentally rewritten) and Charles Laughton's intent The Naked and the Dead to do it instead. Despite some obvious production issues and some harsh lighting that occasionally make both Mitch and Jan Sterling appear in unflattering tones, this is a terrific, dark Western that is more than just a comparison to his earlier "Blood on the Moon" his "citybender" works in a city that never had the chance to grow up before being destroyed by the bad guys on the ground before they turned out to be? possibly ?? was almost as bad as the men he sends. Surely dealing with the news of death in the family? Burn down a hall and get his manager to kill him? not much confidence in its stability. In addition to a good script and a surprisingly good supporting role for the normally irritating, but well-stocked Henry Hull, it also has a remarkably good early Alex North note that even includes an early workout for one of his tortured emotional signals that would later occur emerge in Spartacus.
