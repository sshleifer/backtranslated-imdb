I think the comments on the show as cheesy are a little over the top. When a person comes to watch a television program, what does she have to watch out for? It is gratifying that he is watching a show, unless he is a critic or a person analyzing a story. But most of us are not like that and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show after a busy day in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, an absolutely hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a role model for us. But this is a TV show, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with showing a hypothetical family on TV. The fact that the show was able to run for so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, however the comments would later look. <br /> <br /> Another good point on the show is that any person of any age not only enjoys watching it, but would take a message back, however childish this message may be. These Jesse talks with Michelle are very touching, if you do not look childish. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say, after seeing every Full House show, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
