When I watch a porno movie, I prefer to have some sort of conspiracy and a dialogue about descent. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I have seen with these attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door is cheating on the human nature of the neighbor and the weaknesses that affect seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the preferred actress to play the role of the blackmailing seductress, and she plays the role great. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie gets a total of 10 just because she's there. Her partner in the movie, Monique Alexander, is definitely a sweetheart. The two should work together more. In this movie, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. That's too bad. She seems to have more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was possible as the next wife of DA. I forgot her name, but she looks pretty good and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what makes some people so excited. It is obvious that parts of her were paid and paid. Which one is okay, but is it ready? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid her performance here would have lowered the rating somewhat, except that the talent and beauty of Chelsea override the negatives. Overall, this movie is a good movie.
