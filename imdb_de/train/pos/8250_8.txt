This movie is set in the 1950s. Accordingly, the dead (so-called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. However, a company has developed a collar that, when placed around the neck of zombies, makes them docile and perfect servants. Robinson's mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) are renting a zombie because everyone in their block already has one. Tim calls the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and makes friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go awry. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is, among many other things, a start in the "Lassie" series, where Fido is for Lassie a Timmy was named for a reason! Each of the famous Lassie episodes is filmed here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat him! It's also a satire of those Douglas Sirk movies of the fifties, where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secrets rip people apart. The characters wear very light clothes of the 50s (Moss is always in a dress) - especially the furniture, the equipment and the cars are all in the 1950s in extremely bright colors. Even if the script repeats, there is always something to see. The script is good - but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can do. The melodramatics are kind of stupid, but the cast pulls it off. Everyone here is excellent and just right. Also Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - it plays every line to its full value - but never over exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not for everyone. The satire can be lost to most people and the gore is pretty tame. The thing is so casual and with happy music it's hard to take it seriously. For some people this will really work. I give an 8.
