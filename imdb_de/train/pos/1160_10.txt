It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but that's funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her throw-off line, "God, you're so crazy," as she climbs into his window-great! Kline runs into the door after she's scouted out Teri Hatcher-great!) He finds out who she really is ... a soap opera if everyone was one! <br /> <br /> The scene at the end of the Chinese dining area had my kids and me on the floor - this scene alone is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Solve no world problems or show the apparent abdomen of daytime television (I hope). Just have fun.
