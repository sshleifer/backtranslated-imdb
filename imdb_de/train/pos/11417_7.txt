This movie sounded like a project that had lots of right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not quite come together. I do not know who did it, but it feels a bit like Disney. While parts of it are unlikely (as if a youngster is running for public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in balance to keep the perspective. The acting is fine. Oddly enough, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... gone. It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep the balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. As a baseball player, it was quite painful to see Frankie attempting to assert himself in a boys' team, but it's a good job to show the fight she's facing. I've read somewhere that she's not a ballerina, but the cut in this movie did a very good job of making her look not only natural, but beautiful as well. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but star Mischa Barton did not achieve the level of realism we saw in her performances in Lawn Dogs, Lost and Delirious and her small but shocking performances Haley Joel Osment in "The sixth sense".
