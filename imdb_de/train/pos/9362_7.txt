Greetings from the darkness. How rare is it for a movie to examine the lost soul of aching people. Adam Sandler plays the lead role as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the September 11 tragedy and since then has lost his career, his livelihood, and his reason. Don Cheadle plays a starring role as Sandler's former classmate of Dental School, who seems to have the perfect life (which Sandler apparently had before September 11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in the lives of these men are obvious. It's actually refreshing to see the feelings of men in a movie ... feelings that are not lust and revenge. Seeing them really help just by being there is painful and heartfelt. Author / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) really gives the movie a different look. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but overall they are well written and solid. <br/> <br/> Sandler and Cheadle are both outstanding. Sandler's character is a bit reminiscent of his good performance in "Punch Drunk Love," but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle always does well and expresses the burden he carries. Only by watching how he works a puzzle. <br /> <br /> The support work of Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv, is outstanding Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely appealing role), Donald Sutherland as irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events of the day hit a person so deeply that it is basically ruined. Besides the interesting story and some great shots of New York City, you'll love every movie that features vocals by Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen, and Roger Daltrey ... and Eddie Vedder, who personifies Daltrey. Not just a hippy upbeat movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
