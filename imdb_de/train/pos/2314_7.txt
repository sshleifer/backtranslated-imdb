I had heard good about this movie and was a bit disappointed. As promised, Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good at a young age, surprisingly confident; Actually, all (small) cast are pretty solid in their simple American attitude of the 50s. The reason why I did not rate this movie higher is above all towards the end. The grief that the older sister showed did not seem to be that real and that took me out of the movie. Maybe we're expected to fill in the plot, or the movie should take a bit longer. Maureen's character is pretty underdeveloped in my opinion. It's understandable that Dani (Reese W., the younger one) would be traumatized and angry, but why is her sister more excited? Because she is a few years older? Did not the end undermine the rest of the movie? The tempo of the movie suggests that Maureen and Court have just met while being picked up by a tractor (Warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal; in retrospect it seems like she was trying to shock a little). it works!) . It depends on what you want - if you want the happy story of girls about young love that you seem to get, you'll be surprised. Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy as well as a tough adult. a rather awkward combination? I liked the character of Court, I can see which girls are watching. And I loved the fact that they had the guts to hurt both their younger sister (most men would, most movies would not), and be killed. For some reason, I found Jason London funny on a tractor.
