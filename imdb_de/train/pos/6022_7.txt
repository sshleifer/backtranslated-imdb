The often-misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's political film, the American film by Antonioni. Stylistically, it follows "blow-up," which means that the tempo is faster than the previous epics, though this is certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Basically, the common mistake is that the movie glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists come from very different environments. Mark from the "Rebels", Daria from a real estate agency. In true Antonioni fashion, however, they are both estranged and try to escape their surroundings. Mark leaves behind a meeting of rebel students and Black Panthers, who are disappointed in the wild, empty rhetoric, while Daria is uncomfortable with her car. Antionioni, the lead director, after confusing the rebellious adolescent and feeling shallow, moves to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, billboards and insignificance that must continue to expand in order to accommodate the similar demographic trend while generating a profit. It is this environment from which the two protagonists flee, though it is usually by accident. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria pops up in a small village on the edge of the desert, the surroundings are just as stifling. and the people as well as lost cases, best illustrated by an old boxing champion, now reduced to a shadow of himself, sitting, drinking, smoking and talking nonsense. A breathtaking melancholy sequence that became even more powerful through the inclusion of some half-wild children brought to life by some "benefactors," but "destroyed a real piece of American history." In a not so obscure symbolism there is an opinion of Antonioni to the hippies. Only a half-positive look into the screen of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then there is the desert, the landscape, which is used to devastating effects, alternating pure and frightening, primeval, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two protagonists love each other was created by the "Flower" generation in fantasy "put together" and reflects the similar sequence in "Red Desert", in which Giuliana tells her son a story. It's a colorful break in a colorless landscape. A living semi-fantasy in a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The end probably belongs to the pantheon of the big ends of cinema, the western civilization that's being torn to pieces. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> The two "international" films by Antionioni (the British "Blow-Up" and the American "Zabriskie Point") are less elaborate than the previous masterpieces, but that's largely because of the faster tempo and the inevitably invented settings (swinging London, Flower Power America). But when it matters, it's clear he has not lost the edge.
