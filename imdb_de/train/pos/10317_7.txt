Do you know how Star Trek fans came to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see your heroes in action again. That's how I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a big fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only reinforced the feeling of anticipation. Then they decided to scratch elements from a series of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. There are many promises, watered down by a series of unfortunate decisions (music, "camp" elements, etc.). But the spirit of Doc is there, and that's what everyone who's familiar with Doc and his crew is all about. In my lengthy way, I try to say that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. Anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters should watch this movie to familiarize themselves with the hero who inspired them all.
