This is a unique and courageous movie. It's energetic, with sophisticated characters. Very good services. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br />. Due to the nature of the film, it practically requires that the viewer also looks inward. It may take courage to do so. I can see how some close-minded people find this disturbing. However, I found it thoughtful, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker with vision. I am curious what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch him.
