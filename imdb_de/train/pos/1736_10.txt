You see, this is probably one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 80's were a time of insecurity. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and the destruction of nuclear weapons was almost a certainty. Out of this confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that he was never again cast as a one-dimensional victim in the wild. His triumph is an inspiration to all. The chemistry between Burt and Loni on the screen draws obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Watch this movie tonight!
