An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first ended with a lot of puzzles. Excitement in most if not all episodes and mysteries everywhere. One that made me think and think. It's really amazing how the author can make all the connections and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful. Always exciting and I'm looking forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will be revealed while more puzzles will be solved. Good selection of cast also for this show, the characters fit perfectly. I can not wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully the hype will not spoil the end.
