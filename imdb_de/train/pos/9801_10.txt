The originally animated Dark Knight returns in this Ace adventure movie, which makes the Mask of Phantasm cool in its coolness. Mystery of the Batwoman has a lot of style and intelligence, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> On the streets of Gotham there is a new criminal. She dresses like a bat, but is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any connection with her. In the meantime, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But the penguin, Bain, and the local mob are complicating things a bit. <br /> <br /> I did not have high hopes because I was heavily let down, but the faint Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn 'there was so much!), but I loved the imaginative and exciting Set pieces, the neat action and a naughty humor. This is definitely a movie that should not be a fan of Batman. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song titled "Betcha Neva," which is highlighted throughout. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not that great. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (the short "Chase Me" is fantastic) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie will be presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1, and compared to the widescreen clips shown on the features, the image is truncated on both sides. I find that extremely annoying, considering that Mask of Phantasm was presented on anamorphic widescreen. Warner literally had to re-release dozens of movies on DVD because people complained about the lack of original aspect ratio for some titles. Why they decided to make the same mistake here is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR results in an overall rating of 4/5. Too bad, because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package.
