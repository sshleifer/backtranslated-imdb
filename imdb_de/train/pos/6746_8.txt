This is a great example of a fairly simple film noir story that is exceptionally well-handled thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger and some beautiful acting performances. Dana Andrews plays the lead role as a hot-headed detective who uses his fists too often instead of his brain. Soon after the movie starts, Andrews will be reprimanded and warned that if he continues, he will lose his power. Later, as he investigates a crime, he is attacked by a suspect and Andrews has to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panics, assuming that they will not believe him, so he tries to cover up the death - though instead an innocent man is blamed for the crime. <br /> <br /> Including a conspiracy involving a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest in Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the better examples of the genre - with great dialogue, great lighting, and a simple but very effective story. That's the way Noir should be.
