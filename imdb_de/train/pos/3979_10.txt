I would like all fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and that I am so damn proud of him. This mini-series, shown on VH1, is a great look at the drug culture of the past 30 years, and my uncle has been working very hard on it. The amount of time and effort I've spent in this documentary and the book that started it makes it a lot better to see him on TV. I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is evident in the interviews he made himself and the amazing additions he himself adds to the commentary. From the music to the videos and everything in between, this is a great documentary that shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of a person who has experienced it. I appreciate any comment from those who enjoyed it (or did not) and would like to hear from fans! A high on Uncle Martin !!!
