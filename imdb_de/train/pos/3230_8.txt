Okay, so Soldier is not profound and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big a budget as Terminator 2, but on the whole I found it very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell has remained in the character and does not speak and is not practically emotionless made the moments when his humanity became more pervasive. I found his account of the limited emotional development in the T-Movies more touching than Arnies (and before I get any comments, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt a human, but the premise of both films was the same). <Br /> <br /> So, to the movie itself, a sensible US-Brit can work out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad guys or goodies, so I could not decide if I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic, not a misguided pile of peace-loving / gullible / cowardly hicks wiped out in the first place, nor a group of subversive, aggressive terrorists paranoid of outsiders and others. Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments, I do not think that will have a negative impact on his career (unlike Escape from LA sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee really made his late father proud by continuing the family sci-fi line. And the rest of the cast has helped to work out this miserable group of people who made the most of a bad situation and did not do too badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your TV program, I would recommend that you give it a chance. I do not think you will be disappointed.
