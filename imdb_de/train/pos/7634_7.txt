<br /> <br /> Ok, the movie would not win prizes and it's pure bubblegum, and it's a modern update to "It's a wonderful life". But it's just a cheap release on DVD and there are far worse ways to blast $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong cast, but for most it was still a year or two before it became a B-list star. However, it is a pleasant way to bridge an hour and a half, and do not think too much about it.
