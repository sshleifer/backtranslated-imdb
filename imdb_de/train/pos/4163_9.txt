I saw this as a kid in the late eighties and I have to say Galaxy Express is one of those movies that will give your imagination a long run. If you have never understood the charm of anime, the discovery of this film could be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The cell animation, while somewhat traditional, has a lively style that explodes Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling. This is one of those unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal, and The Wizard of Oz, which completely transcend the status of "Family Entertainment" and are classics of cinema on its own terms. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
