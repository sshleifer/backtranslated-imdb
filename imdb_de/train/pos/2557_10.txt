I myself am a child at heart, that is, I love to see cartoons, still do it! I remember seeing Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was still my favorite. I thought man, this was a great "new" show on TV, and when my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember seeing him when I was younger" and I'm like, "Dad, Bugs did not exist when you were younger ". I think he is definitely more than a generation happy, maybe 3. I love the show, it's great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, me and my husband, both in our 20s, love to watch the shows, and the reps do not bother us either. This show brings back many happy memories. I also love the Christmas special with Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not choose my favorite character from Looney Toons as it has changed over the years. Of course, when I was little, it was Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I've always loved him. Actually, I have to say all my favorites there. I give this show a 10 out of 10 points because it's a great show for all ages. Very funny, the voice acting is incredible. The only mistake is that unfortunately it ended two decades ago, but the replay is great!
