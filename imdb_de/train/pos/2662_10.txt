* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I begin with that, I would like to say that I had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and the Authorized Version of This movie was made in 1997 by Stephen King himself newly designed. <br /> <br /> Both advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Shining" all the more. <br /> <br /> Also, let me say that I have read Mr. King's book "The Shining" on many occasions over the years, and although I love the book and am a big fan of his work, that is Stanley Kubrick retelling this story much more convincingly ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to bring the horror of the psyche straight to film. In the direction of the film AND the writing of the screenplay itself, he acquired the title "Magus". Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. His other outstanding credits include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> The Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife, and Danny, her son) live the winter at Overlook Hotel; Jack was hired as a janitor. It is his job to oversee the maintenance of the hotel in the hard, hard months until spring reopens. It seems there are many wealthy and run-down tourists flocking to the Colorado Mountains for a snowy summer vacation. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It gave the atmosphere a dark but at the same time "inviting" atmosphere. The furnishings and furnishings were all period (late 70s - early 80s), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach of overlooking, it also determines how abandoned and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the characters of Wendy and Danny was a stroke of genius. They get the whole story of their past, Danny's "Imaginary Friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism in this beautiful, neat introductory scene. There was no need to extend the past to two hours of film; Obviously Kubrick saw that from the beginning. <br /> <br /> closing day. Again the scenic drive was up the mountains to the hotel (this time with the family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious and also a very disturbing exchange. The first tour of the Overlook hotel is quite breathtaking, though the "bar" that moves things, you have the chance to see the majestic fire pits, the cathedral's high ceilings and the expensive furnishings, sleeping places and crown moldings in the architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) The staff staff is well designed and beautifully designed. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was a great touch, reminding of the labyrinth where the Minotaur of Crete Guardian was. When Jack Nicholson stands in front of the scale model of the labyrinth and stares into the center and sees Wendy and Danny enter, that's a magical moment. one that immediately tells you there are heavy energies in this house; It is a serious problem that is already starting. "I would not want to go in if I did not have at least an hour to find out." (The Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers was honest and open in his performance as Dick Halloran. His smile was natural and his performance was wonderful. You could really believe you were in the hotel with Wendy and "Doc." Went through the kitchen. His explanation of "The Shining" for Danny was very good, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the hotel. It was believable and sincere. <br /> <br /> The cut-out Pan-scan of the hotel itself, the mountains behind it, the cold air whirling around, fog from the warm roof of the snow-covered hotel so much to the atmosphere of the film. It also marks the "halfway to hell", so to speak; The turning point in the movie. Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (Well, WHAT, if she played Olive Oyl too ?!) She just shows her amazing variety!) Before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released. ) But I pulled that back when the movie started, she's brilliant, and in the opinion of her, this is her best performance yet (though I loved her in Steve Martin's Roxanne, 1987) Kubrick has identified the pearly information that you, the viewer, must own: the past of Torrence, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the history of the hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental" but clairvoyant and the general layout of the hotel, all three of them are in the first 3 sequences, the film does not stop to scare you. <br /> <br /> The two slaughtered daughters of the former janitor, Delbert Grady (the girls were Danny occurred several times, first about Tony in the apartment, before the family was h They were icons Danny could identify with and at the same time he was afraid of. They were persecuted (and persecuted), showed themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way. Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spiritual leader he followed when his arm was almost torn from his body by his own father. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth." He finally manifested himself in Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny to talk to Danny. NOT as in the book, I know where Stephen King intended to project Danny as an older boy trying to save his father. Kubrick skipped that little twist and it made it somehow more scary when Tony "Danny ... Danny ... took over." Danny's idea that his older self springs back to his younger self is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The "Woman in the Shower" scene by Lia Beldan (of which I can not find other credits) because they did before or after, as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (the ALSO apparently under a lack of credits for works before or after suffering), was seductively repugnant and utterly disgusting. It was dramatic and terrifying. Abominable and scary. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees her decaying flesh under his hands; the expression of terrible terror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly makes his way from being a "jonesing" alcoholic to a certifiable mental patient. The deterioration of his mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd the bartender (as only alcoholics, potential mental patients, and drug addicts do) portrays his urgent need for the atmosphere in which Lloyd places him; namely alcohol ... "hair of the dog that bit me." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, free for Jack. "Orders from the house." (Lloyd the bartender) Nice pun. <br /> <br /> If Wendy Jack finds Jack Jack to be a screenplay, this is nothing but page after page of the same line that has been typed again and again, but in 8 or 9 different creative styles. ..if he asks from the shadows: "how do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand ... is so poignant. It's the point where she realizes how confused the whole situation is ... how confused Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and has a strong presence. Coupled with Danny's visions of how the hotel lobby is filled with blood and the scene between Jack and Wendy is pushed on, as well as the confrontational end of the scene, these may make it the film's strongest scene. <br /> <br /> The scene "REDRUM". Impressive. What can I say? Which mother would not be completely crazy if she wakes up and sees her young, restless son standing in front of her with a huge knife, talking with that crazy little voice and repeatedly invoking "REDRUM"? Even if it did not matter, it would be as scary as the seventh level of HELL. It was something everyone could remember (and have). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's last attack on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the scariest scenes in film history. His ad libbed line "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a glory and one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes into the history of the horror movie. <br /> <br /> The end ..? Kubrick's end was perfection. I felt that it ended beautifully. No smell, no flat whining, no tearful idiot for this movie. Simply perfectly embodied. That's all I'll say on the topic of the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what has been taken out ?! Look what Kubrick put in. Rent it, watch it, buy it. It's a classic in the horror genre, and with good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me Being Me * ... Take this movie and put it in your Stephen King collection. Take King's "Authorized" version of 1997 and keep it in the Kiddie section. That's it. .: This movie is rated 9.98 by Fiend :.
