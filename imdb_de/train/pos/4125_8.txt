I liked watching "Sea Hunt" when I was at a high school and did my homework. At 4:30 am I would be willing to see "Sea Hunt" and Mike Nelson on his underwater adventures. I loved it ! He took you a place that was not so accessible at the time, under the big blue sea. Before the '' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became common, Mike Nelson aroused the children's imagination. I would be willing to bet that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences of watching this show. Underwater photography also progressed, the fascination of the exploration is easily stimulated by the reputation of this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
