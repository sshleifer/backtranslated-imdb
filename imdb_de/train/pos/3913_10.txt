Carlos Saura's Carmen is one of the finest achievements in the world, let alone Spanish cinema. He manages to arouse interest in flamenco in his wonderful staged adaptations of Bizet with his powerful powers. At the same time we see the influence of the creation and repetition of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and the main dancers. The border between life and art is dazzling.
