I am an Austrian myself and it was a pure punch in my face. Fortunately, I do not live close to the place where this movie is playing, but unfortunately, everything that the rest of Austria hates is hated by Viennese people (or by people close to this region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the directors: to put your head in your hands and say, "Oh my God, how can that be possible!". No, not with me, the (in my opinion) totally exaggerated, uncensored swingers club scene is not necessary, I look at porn, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story of how misguided people suffering from lack of education or bad society try to survive in a world of layoffs and boring horizons. A girl who is treated (and still returns) like a whore by her super jealous friend, a teacher who discovers her masochism by risking the life of her superhuman "lover", an old couple who has done so almost mathematical day-cycle (she is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who are divorcing and must suffer the ex-husband from his former wife's deeds, evidently with a relationship with her masseuse and eventually with one crazy hitchhikers Who asks their drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves, because it is just annoying. <br /> <br /> After you've seen them, you feel almost nothing. They are not even shocked, sad, depressed or want to do anything. Maybe that's why I rated it 7 points. This has made me react in a way that I never reacted to before. Whether that's good or bad is up to you!
