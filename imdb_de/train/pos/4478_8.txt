Overall, this is a delightful, carefree, romantic, musical comedy. I think it could be a small case for the movie, which is too long. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra make? No, the fabulous dancing Kelly does? No. The time the film needs to develop the plot and develop the relationships of the characters? No (that seems to be a common complaint that newer films do not develop the characters). <br /> <br /> Some comments that Iturbi did not contribute much to the film, but this gives us the chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s. What if he was not an actor? He was an important part of the movie because the basic plan was to have Grayson audition with him. <br /> <br /> Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to a screen test with an aria to MGM. During their foreplay in the movie, there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling. One can only imagine that it was like that when she did her real screen test years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it's hard to reach all the highlights. There was a lot of color and lighting throughout the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. A nice counterpoint in the film is how Sinatra (then a women's man) played the role of finding a date only while on vacation. You will feel good after watching this movie. 10.7
