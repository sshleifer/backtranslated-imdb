This film tells the story of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane are the main characters. As the civil war comes to an end, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's momentum would be strengthened if people followed the advice: "Go West, young man," which, fortunately, the film did not falsely attribute to Horace Greeley , how many others. Then he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can sell rich weapons to the American Indians. In the meantime, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a little boy Steamboat loads at a dock along the Mississippi River. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy and calls it "Arkansas toothpick," which was actually a different type of knife, though both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock Finally he meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who comes close to the photographs and paintings of the real man. Cody has just married and is taking his bride to the Old West to settle there. When they arrive at the destination, they meet Calamity Jane, who is in love with Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill: "Is that your pugnies?" The line caused some problems for the Hayes Board, as a definition of "mopsie" was a prostitute. Demille wanted the line, and one of his aides pointed out that three of the rabbits in Beatrix Potter's books were about Peter Rabbit Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of ill virtue." It worked; The line stayed in. <br /> <br /> The Indians were getting restless, partly because of the superior weapons they had received from the Eastern Funders' agent. Cody and Hickock were asked to assist in the exploration of the area so that the troops could safely enter a besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check on the activities of an Indian chief who was an old acquaintance and led some of the hostile Indians. Calamity Jane is captured, and Hickock is captured as he tries to rescue her. They are brought to the boss, and although they would not talk to each other, the torture Hickock uses breaks the willpower of Calamity Jane and she tells the route Cody uses. <br /> <br /> The two are released and Hickock joins Cody and his forces, in part to warn her, run into a trap. With Hickok's help they hold back the attack of the Indians. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to pursue the gunners and eventually captures them. While waiting for authorities, Hickock is shot down by being shot in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are numerous historical anomalies in the film, the legend is preserved. Pretty good for the 1930s.
