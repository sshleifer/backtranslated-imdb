Since I'm not a fan of almost all "Desperate Living" John Waters movies, I was warmed up to "Pecker". Upon emerging from the underground, Waters produced trashlite versions of his earlier works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") that looked and tasted like die-hard fans like watered-down liquor." Pecker, "which is not the case Trying to ignore early successes is a quiet, quiet, humble commentary on the inconsistencies of celebrity and the presumption of the art world." Waters knows this very well because he also owns some of these products The most amateur pop art ever created and unimaginable that anyone can reveal anything if it is not decorated with the "name" of Waters, Edward Furlong is fine Because "Pecker" and Waters' non-Histrionic style feel comfortable the theme.
