As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of director / producer / playwright David Belasco turning notorious, divorced woman Leslie Carter into an international stage star) is certainly not in league with Warner's other biography of Yankee Doodle Dandy "(what is it?), But" Lady "is a handsome movie - AND has some similarities with the Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" is bursting with the show business flair of the past. (Both films feature delicious theatrical sequences as well as the inevitable backdrops behind the scenes and in the offices of theater directors.) Also in "Lady" as in the Cohan biopic, the side cast consists of confidants and beloved character actors of the time, all of them do a first-class job for which we remember them. <br /> <br /> I have to add that "The Lady With Red Hair" like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The lady with red hair" does not hinder the truth when it comes to telling a good story ? But even with "Dandy" succeeds "Lady" to convey the essence of the larger than life personality of her show business giant. Everyone knows that Cagney Cohan has cursed for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few in the audience know that Claude Rains did a similar service to David Belasco in The Lady With Red Hair did it also with a madness that almost matches that of Cagney. Rains-as-Belasco captures the galactic personality of the legendary showman perfectly in his oversized splendor. Rain offers an incredibly enjoyable, superbly watched, and remarkably lifelike performance than the man once referred to on Broadway as "The Wizard." Seeing Claude Rains in action (in any setting, looking like he's having a good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair," David Belasco, who brings to life in the movie as if he could not wait to see things to wake up on the main trunk once more. <br /> <br />
