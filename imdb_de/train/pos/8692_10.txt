I always liked to see it. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I must have been about six when it was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination with something that was clear and lay in the heap of President's bathtub toys. My parents had taken this from television when it was originally aired on NBC. The band even had the old Sanka coffee pot along with a few others. I plan to return home soon and will try to tape it on my computer so those who want a copy can do so. If any of you want to contact me, I think you can do that through the IMDb site, feel free. I will keep you updated and tell you when I have the show in a digital format.
