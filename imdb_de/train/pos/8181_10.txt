Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Suddenly he discovers that his wife breaks out with the lifeguard ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the confused dentist - he is absolutely believable. It's surprisingly little, but the scenes of torture are pretty evil and grotesque. We recommend.
