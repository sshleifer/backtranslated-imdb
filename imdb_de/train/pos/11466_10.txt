I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing thing. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is similar to The Blair Witch Project. It was completely recorded with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Only your average children. Andre and Calvin They start a campaign against high school called "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in video diary form by the two children. It shows relationships with their parents, including the fact that these are just normal children, just like people we know or have met with. We learn that the last mission of the Army of 2 Zero Day is justified. They want to shoot up there. <br /> <br /> You see how they have access to their weapons, how they plan it, everything. They emphasize that the media did not influence them at all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, this is all said in the form of a video diary, and then the tapes are kept in a safe to see after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual shots are shown throughout the school through Survillence cameras. Chilling indeed The movie is very calming. Some of the things they say, how they plan it, you just have to see for yourself. A quote that I remember is the only time Calvin finds himself. He says, "Andre thinks he would just leave in a getaway car and do so at numerous schools across the country, I do not know what he thinks, but the only way I get out of school is in a black one Plastic bag ". <br /> <br /> I probably will not even give you the right idea of ​​this movie. You really have to see it for yourself. It's about festivals now. <br /> <br /> A +.
