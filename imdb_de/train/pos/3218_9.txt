Nine points out of ten seem to be a high score for directing a sci-fi movie into the video that was vilified at the US box office and criticized as the poorest movie on Kurt Russel's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, if you read negative reviews of this film, they usually begin with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous soldier. I also start here with my surprise statement that this may be the best play I've ever seen from Russell. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffers from intense PTSD - this movie written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The presentation is just right. Todd is withdrawn, not communicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety, which is brought to a fever pitch by training. He teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another person for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyperfocus implies that he is unable to grasp the larger continuum that contains the tasks he has to deal with - there is a scene in which he cuts himself and continues cutting carrots works unimpressed and does not clean up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical tenacity and concentrate on the work to be done, but it is also a sign that he simply does the task requested by heart - and not the relationship between the vegetables he has prepared and what is expected Eating understands Eat later. <br /> <br /> Todd 'Dialog is spartan to say the least - the two great conversational scenes he receives are at the heart of the film's storyline, underscoring the bleak nature of its existence. Fear and discipline are told. Always. Afraid that he will be pumped into a state of hyperwarning in which the smallest detail does not happen to him, and keeps him ready to respond to a knife edge. Discipline to keep him at bay by his fear, overcome and act tactically. The conclusion is that he has no time to think and can not afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the embrace of Nielsen's Sandra - but I think you have to interpret them from the perspective of someone who has only experience with a hug in combat - the trembling means he suppresses his combat / air instincts the fear of being grasped limited his movement and his vision - fear and discipline, in fact. <br /> <br /> Then there is the subtext of his task (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way in which our society seems to throw infantrymen on the garbage heap of society when they have fulfilled their conditions , 40% of the unemployed in our countries are ex-military, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly seizes Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately needing a mission, even one whose death rate is so high. Then there is the military subtext - the conflict between Busey's Church and the Hotshot of the headquarters of Mecca. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more precise and more aggressive. Anyone could hammer Todd into the ground - but it's not about what tools you have, but how you use them. An incentive that gave Todd the freedom to pursue his initiative and act without the numbing effect of perceived superiority uses tactics and trickery to slap the newer unit - without support, cover or enlightenment. It is a reminder that the military power can not make up for a failure in the leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle topics. When a movie is filmed and shot so minimally there is enough room for your own interpretations to take root. Watch soldier open minded and see what it teaches you.
