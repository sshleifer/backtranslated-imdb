Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. This film celebrates the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that? In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or whatever, fill in the blanks) it's easy to see why this topic is not for everyone. As the roles of the father played a prominent role, I hoped that this would be another Daniell Steel saga. How disappointing that it has an end. Every character was important and did a great job. I would have loved to see how each character has developed over the years. I loved this movie, I will watch it defiantly every time it runs. Good story, good acting, and I hope that's not a spoiler, but no intrusive sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Attention, finish the Kleenex. I find it sad that this side of family life is rarely portrayed in our conversation today, be it on television or on television. Movies. Daniell, if you hear, you go girls, give us more.
