It is really unfortunate that most people outside Canada think that Canada only produces snow, mountains and hockey players. This movie is the second Canadian superlative movie I've seen in recent weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), far better than any other, but the best in Hollywood. Gustad Noble is anything but Das; He is a middle-aged Parsi banker in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him in relation to his family, friends and work, and their impact on him. At the same time it is a fascinating and, I would suggest, accurate portrayal of bourgeois urban life in India at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was a bit prepared. A few years ago, Rohinton read Mistry's book. As you might expect, the film can not capture all the complexities of the book, but if you're reading a really good book and want to see a really good movie, read "Seek a Long Journey".
