If tradition requires an artist to pass on his great skills and magic to an heir, the aging and very proud street artist known as "The King of Masks" despairs of accepting and cultivating a young man His warmth and humanity find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters. In this case, it came in the 1930s to massive flooding. <br /> <br /> He takes his new, 7 year old companion on his straw boat to live with his beloved and beautiful monkey "General" only to discover that the child is a female. <br /> <br /> His life changes immediately, as the love he feels for this little slave girl is entangled in the startling tradition that compels him to pass his art on to a young man only. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this ... many people are touched, and the culture of China opens to our Western eye. Thousands of years of tradition are bubbling into a teacup of the drama, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not great as I've found the volume everywhere the meter and could actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
