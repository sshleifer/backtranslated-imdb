The original title means "The Birth of the Kraken". I must confess that I do not quite understand this title. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read another user's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" Prieuve "or octopus, suggesting that a person must juggle a lot of pressure at the same time." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is girls' first sexual emotions when it is unclear whether they are referring to the same or the opposite sex. This is no different for boys. I think that both Floriane and Marie will someday have heterosexual feelings. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is water ballet. Sometimes the girls have their heads down and nothing above the water except their feet and legs, with which they wave and kick in the air. For people like me who have never seen anything like it, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "Water Lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she would like to see Floriane training. This seems to be the first contact that is not just ordinary. Soon they will go together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then walks for an hour while Marie waits for her return. For me it was self-evident that the couple slept together. But we will learn later from the film that they do less. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that only a few users find elsewhere. There is a scene where Marie secretly steals Florian's garbage bag. In it she finds a mostly eaten apple. And Marie eats the rest. ?? In another film, there is a parallel scene, "Kazetachi no gogo" (Afternoon Breezes) by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). It is about adult young women, and a clearly lesbian woman is in love with a heterosexual woman in vain. She also steals a lover's garbage bag, finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Marie tells Marie that she wants her first orgasm from her. Marie says she can not do that. <br /> <br /> But later, Marie says that she is indeed ready. And she masturbates with Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a female director would have such a good psychological show or study of ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire: "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Ad√®le Haenel, who has performed excellently as an "autistic girl" in "The Little Devil" by Christophe Ruggia (2002). ? a very underrated movie.
