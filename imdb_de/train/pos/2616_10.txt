The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to do with the Lion King. It follows essentially the original story of The Lion King, but with a few twists. In the movie, vents are explained through a different point of view of the characters. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> As for the sequel, Disney is not very good at making worthwhile ones. This part, the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second one.), Has an original idea, while at the same time incorporating the fun of the first one. Timon and Pumbaa are looking for the ideal place to live. After looking far and wide, they find the place "Hakuna Matata". They then meet a little lion named Simba and go through many things that parents go through today.
