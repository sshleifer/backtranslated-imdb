This is one of those movies you wish you'd never seen before - so you could see it "for the first time" again. Van Dine's books are still a source of joy, but many consider them overly flowery. This film is by far the best filming of his works. William Powell is William Powell - do not say anything else. The plot is complicated. The story moves too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
