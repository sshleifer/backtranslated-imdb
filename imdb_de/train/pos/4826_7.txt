This film is about the life of Queen Victoria in her youth and her first years as Monarch of Britain. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated down to the last detail. The extravagant costumes, lush locations and beautifully landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. The thoughtful camera surprised me the most. How each person is related to the background or foreground is thoughtful, each scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me most was when Victoria talked to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned from Victoria's corner in the center of the doorway, while Victoria from Melbourne was between the room where Melbourne had his arm on his hips, followed and understood by a person with no historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not explained at all. I was expecting a great scene of the Coronation, and disappointingly it only took a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it had taken longer, so that events can be properly explained without hurry.
