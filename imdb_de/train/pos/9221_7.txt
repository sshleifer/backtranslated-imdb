I once again burned through the discount video store and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time I'm in the dumpster, it's just crap (I mean terribly incredible), but half the time is surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very appealing, although it was obviously made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is nothing special, but the story fascinates with some good thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, no worldliness, no nudity, no sex. Usually these films need all four elements. The PG rating is well deserved - not like "Sixteen Candles," where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short, nude bare-breasted love interest could have been more developed. The movie tends to be plotty and the potentially good subplots are pushed aside. Instead of developing chemistry between the two, we look at a careless three-minute montage of their romantic undertakings. In the end, they kiss at the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. It's pretty much forgotten - especially by a number of unknowns except Haim - but it's also much better than you would expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
