There should be more films about our Native Americans. I think in particular that the use of real Native Americans would be the right thing. I know that this Archie Belaney, who was played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job of portraying this character since he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to put more American Indians in the roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux Nation has been pushed into the background for far too long. Their poverty is a shame for our country. I am firmly convinced that our country should bring the Black Hills back to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return its land to the Arabs, but we do not try to do the same, we should be ashamed. We have to practice what we preach!
