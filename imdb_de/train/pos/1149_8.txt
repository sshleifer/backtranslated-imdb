Fast and funny satire about the original "Reality TV", the soap opera. The screenplay of the playwright Robert Harling is full of deposits and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly turns into a bad improvisation and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murder of his lines because he does not wear glasses is funny. "Your brain will explore laterally in the next houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It's a treat when a cast is clicked like this movie. This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. The score of Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It suits the soap opera with its extravagant and melodramatic atmosphere.
