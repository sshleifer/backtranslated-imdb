This show is wonderful. It has some of the best typefaces I have ever seen. It has a brilliant directing by Dvid Trainer, who also staged another intelligent television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest. As with THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be shown on television for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> From the perfectly made jokes to the great performances you would only dream of, this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and people who did not. This show appeals to the young and the young at heart. A perfect show.
