Great show by Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics on the screen for some time now. While covering the majority of Bettie's young life, it remains on a mostly focused path that seems to be lacking in most biographical films. There is a beautiful and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and in the drama. This movie is a great departure from the "American Psycho" Dirk, and I think that will prove to be her best work so far. Oh, and as a movie fan, I give this movie 100% in the movie department. It was amazing how well they had a '50s look with modern movie stocks. Awards for the D.O.P. All in all very pleasing. I recommend anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
