This is a dramatic movie in the truest sense of the word. It tells us that here in Greece we live in everyday life without knowing how sad it is. Sure, it does have some extremes ... but sometimes grief surpasses art in real life. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the overall social structure that is built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a particular fast-food mainstream audience, this movie is not aimed at anyone, but as you watch it, you feel that someone has the best possible words and pictures describing your feelings starts. I'm not a big fan of traditional music either, but I would not like to hear anything else if it was played during the movie. <br /> <br /> If somebody told me to say something against this movie, I would define it. In the following, the transition between the scenes sometimes seemed to be suddenly or slightly shortened. I think the cut had to be cut to the 2 hours and a bit for the theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could always write more to express my thoughts about it, but I think you have to see it and discuss it with a friend. Something you must have seen
