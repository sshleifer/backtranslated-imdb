I thought this would be a wonderful way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sit in the air-conditioned theater and watch a carefree comedy. The plot is simple, but the dialogue is funny and the characters are sympathetic (even the most likely serial killer). Some may be disappointed to find that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, but I thought it would prove that Woody Allen still masters the style that many of us love. <br /> <br /> That was the best thing I've ever laughed at any of Woody's comedies for years (can I say a decade?). Although I've never been impressed by Scarlet Johanson, she managed to soften her "sexy" image and jumped straight into an average but spirited young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was funnier than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" to see a great comedy with friends.
