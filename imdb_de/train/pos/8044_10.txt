First, this is just the funniest movie I've ever seen. It includes perfectly tuned slapstick, sexual humor and a sophisticated stand-up. But it goes deeper. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we do not often see) that gave me hope that there is love, that two people who love each other can work through their adversities; and that such a comic life (something I believe we should all should have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni is as convincing as Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope that in the future we will see more films from all involved.
