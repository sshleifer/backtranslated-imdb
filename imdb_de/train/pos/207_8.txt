At first it looked like a boring comedy like "The Odd Couple", but when I got in, it became a very funny movie. Basically, the forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner and Oscar and BAFTA for Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove for George Burns) were a great comedy duo for a TV show. Willy's nephew Ben Clark (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is confident that he can regain his sense of wrongness without hard feelings. They can not get along, they are both forgetful, especially during the conversation, but they do eventually. With Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's sister and Muppets of Space Murray's Abraham as a mechanic. I think the best line of the movie is Burns, who mentions that Matthau calls him "a son of a bitch". It was nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Writing for the Academy Awards, the script from other material, the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy, and it was nominated Best Screenplay , Very well!
