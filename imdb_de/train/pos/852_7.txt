THE MATADOR is the hit-man movie lite ... if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown, but often introduced. At first I was afraid that I had another retooling of the gangster hit man hipster dark comedy in the mid-90s. BUT was happy surprised when I realized that this is just a cute and humorous story about friendship. Nothing exciting happens in this movie, but every song makes me smile. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years, and it looks like they've had a great time together to make this movie. The writing is sharp, though sometimes it feels like the script has been adapted from a stage play due to the one-step dialogue scenes. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for long, but back then it was an absolute joy. Good movie.
