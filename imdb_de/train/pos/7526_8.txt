Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gimmick whose earlier films revealed the artistic excesses of the sixties and the hollow, stingy eighties. With "The Notorious Bettie Page" she shows her unwavering eye on Fifties America, a time veiled in the moral justice of Joe McCarthy as she experiences the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would lead to the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-author Guinevere Turner clearly have no interest in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how its pure, unkempt sexuality reveals both the predatory instincts and the impure thoughts of a culture unaffected by the beauty of a naked body. If Bettie's life was just the details of the movie, why would it end before its most tragic time began? Harron is obviously more interested in America's attitude to sexual images then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the breathtakingly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III she achieves this goal admirably. Called pornography. As America stifles under a new conservatism, this is a movie needed more than ever.
