I watched this movie on TV one night before a night, but it was a disturbing experience that has remained with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The Premise May Be Slightly Unoriginal - Due to an Earthquake, a Hidden Underground Storage of a poisonous nerve agent in the hills above a small town is broken, and a microscopic amount of the substance enters its food supply. The inhabitants of the city lose their ability to ignore every mood and every basic desire that moves through all our thoughts from time to time, and we usually know that we simply can not act accordingly. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie is slow, but for me the uncomfortable discomfort increased as the behavior of the citizens slowly dissipates. There are some surreal and very disturbing scenes that have been remembered all the time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we could all do if we face our wildest instincts. Did I like it? I'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. Did it make me think? Certainly. I still think about it. Creepy stuff.
