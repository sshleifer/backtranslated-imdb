I rented this movie when it came to videotape and I really liked it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago, and have watched it several times since then. I would have to agree with others when they say Indian Summer is a nostalgic movie. If I see it, I wish I could be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like the movie to a degree. We all sometimes wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice if all your friends / parents were young again? Not having to worry about your job, being a parent, etc ... ??? I know that I would like to jump into a De Lorean and return to the past. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, my favorite movie is Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish you could make an Indian summer version of it.
