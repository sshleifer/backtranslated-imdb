"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I was a bit disappointed. The central theme of a city plagued by a plague today is intriguing, but the film never explores or develops it. It's well done and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The script for this movie is really weak and brings down the whole movie. None of the central characters is really convincing or credible. Luckily the movie is very well done, so it compensates for the weak script. The direction of Elia Kazan ensures that the film remains charged with lightning speed. There are some outstanding sequences, especially the memorable hunting highlight. When his direction was combined with better scripts a few years later, the man usually could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a respected leader and does what he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming too much, but he also does a decent job. The most outstanding in the cast are the two villains. Most notably known for his comic roles, Zero Mostel is effectively slimy as one of the ultimate warrior characters in the cinema. Jack Palance is no surprise rogue. "Panic in the streets" is disappointing, but still worth seeing. (7/10)
