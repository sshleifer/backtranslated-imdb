Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I have read his two books and think he is great. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best. The combination of the two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really gets to know each other. A road trip connects father and son for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all that fathers and sons should do in life ... they only do it much later in life. The situations are very funny, but feel that they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsessively high or cartoonish). This is the first time I have looked at Paul Reiser and completely believed in every emotion that was presented. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie and a great story and storyline. It has comedies and emotions, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas also does a great job :)
