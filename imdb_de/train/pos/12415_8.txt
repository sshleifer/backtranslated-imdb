This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee, but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie are funnier. I was thoroughly amused and laughed out loud many times. Great central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian who invades England with his free-flowing, outrageous ways to upset the poms. Few Britons are upset by Barry's often cruel observations of his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is prickly but friendly. This is underscored by the last line of the movie, which is delivered by a somewhat restrained McKenzie as he climbs the plane home. "I just started liking the poms."
