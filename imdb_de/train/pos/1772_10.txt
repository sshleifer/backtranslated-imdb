What a relief, I do not imagine this program! The summary of Taxman is great. I also remember that I experienced it as haunting and not especially for families. I think for a girl age was part of the attraction of very fair hair and a permanent, sad state. The theme was played on a flute that I remember - though I can not remember how it went. I think the intro showed him how he played - or maybe he played flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm destined never to know how it ended, or to see or hear the melody, but at least I know now that it's not just me.
