First of all, I just want to say what a big fan of Bette Midler I am. Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a mother raising a child by herself, she goes through many things that are not able to raise her daughter Jenny, who is wonderfully played by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you get a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it has earned 4! WONDERFUL! I give 4 out of 4!
