Well, I know that French prisoners probably did not read Lovecraft (and that proves that his writings should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject) lead to every good? <br /> <br /> The film is set in a prison where four unlikely cellmates find a magical book that, if properly read, can bring it out. In the prisons, the cell was completely unrealistic, so it was hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which can bore people. But other than that, it's a first-rate horror feeling that Sartre's "Hell is other people" is mixed up with a Lovecraft / Barker story and runs pretty successfully. This means that you should not do it when you go to work, sleep or do something else. This is a movie that works best when you immerse yourself in it. Learning lessons: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
