This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. To put it in perspective, it was when Gay was the word for the homosexual revolution, not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used today? I think most of the film is from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993 and is therefore in the area. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentaries that strangely capture a man's love for another man over 20 and more years. A love expressed in a way that can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain as well as scenes of pleasure and enjoyment. There are scenes of life as gay and gay. The movie itself was a love job and I believe that it is a diamond. <br /> <br /> At the very least, this film will give you an understanding of the devastating effects of AIDS. As I write this, I think about how much earlier this movie seems to have been played to me. The advances in medicine, politics, social sciences and culture that have taken place since the film was shot (about 15 years ago) are amazing. Of course, we are not finished with the AIDS disease itself. I guess we're not done on all fronts. <br /> <br /> It's just a damn good documentary anyway. I would encourage anyone who does not properly understand gay life, gay issues or the destruction of AIDS to watch this movie.
