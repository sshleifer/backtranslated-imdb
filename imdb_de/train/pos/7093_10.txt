You have to be careful with Twelve Monkeys, but if you do that you will probably appreciate a lot. I know that I did it. The story is interesting and deals with time travel. A virus killed many people in 1997, and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and taken to a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while locked up in a room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories. <br /> <br /> The movie is constantly being played over time. Cole phones and leaves a message in 1996, this will be picked up in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, this person appears just seconds after the call. Such things happen throughout the movie and therefore you have to stay alert. You might ask a few questions, but since you can not have an answer yourself, it's better to agree to the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' works as a sci-fi, with great pictures and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You're never sure what's going to happen next, and that helps the movie. Maybe it has some shortcomings in the story, but since it's a fictional thing like time travel, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy it. That was the easy part for me.
