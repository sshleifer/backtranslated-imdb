The movie did not go well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a preview. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie, where the players of the past have gone. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever brought to the screen, but a pleasing role. <br /> <br /> Best line of the movie at the beginning of Robin's character Jack: "I was the SOB!" Tidied up here so as not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> Was glad when it came to DVD in widescreen / letterbox format a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be one to like this movie.
