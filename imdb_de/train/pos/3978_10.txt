I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Home," which contains much information about America's drug culture in the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I found him an outstanding speaker of this documentary. I especially enjoyed seeing movie clips from the hippie era and the 70s stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it definitely had the tunes of each epoch. Hopefully they will pack them and sell them as a CD set. I recommend it to anyone who cares how the 1960s LSD experiments have forever changed American culture as we know it. What was missing was the mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the film "Blow"), who was allegedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine that came to this country in the 60s to 80s.
