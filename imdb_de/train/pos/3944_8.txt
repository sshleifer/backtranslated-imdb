This little movie has been on my "Keeper" list for a long time. Do people know how stressed-out, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as mentally disabled) were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century? !! All the devout, sincere Christian attitudes of that time have been deadly for exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, not to mention embracing our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as feelings and emotional responses like a man? Think about it! The sensitivity of this movie still arouses me and I appreciate the director, that he has captured this with his eyes.
