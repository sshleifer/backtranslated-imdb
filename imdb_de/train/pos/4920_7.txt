No, not really, but this is really a very good movie and unfortunately is a forgotten gem. Black and white fits the movie. <br /> <br /> Straightforward formula, one guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down all who he came in contact with before they die. <br /> <br /> Very well directed, and the spectacle is great. Richard Widmark as a male lead is good, but is completely overshadowed in the drama by Paul Douglas as police captain and Jack Palance (never better than this one) and Zero Mostel as villains. Sadly, Palance played similar characters in some low-quality gangster or war movies.
