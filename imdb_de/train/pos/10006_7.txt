In this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and presenter of the evening talk show, is intrigued by the shocking story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette) The story of this boy, but Gabriel engages in an expanding mystery that hides a deadly secret. "According to the official summary of the film. <br /> <br /> You should stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> The "How did he lose his leg?" In the end, with Miss Collette planning her new life, she should be cut off and land in "deleted scenes". It is exaggerated. The true nature of her physical and mental discomfort should be apparent when Mr. Williams returns to New York. Their blindness may be called into question, but a revelation could be made in the "highway" or "videotape" scenes. The film would benefit from post-production - how about a director's cut? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) do not seem believable as a couple at first. One or two scenes in which the relationship was made might have helped shape the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and no "gay identity". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs in the creepy Hall of Fame. Ms. Oh is right in saying Collette could be, "You know, like that guy from 'Psycho'." There were several years when organizations that received acting awards seemed to be reaching out to women due to a lower distribution of roles. surely they would have noticed Collette with some price considerations. She is so good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely remembers Hitchcock - he even makes it exciting to get a sandwich from a vending machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, the writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson all earn thanks from flight attendants everywhere. <Br /> <br /> ******* The Night Listener (21.01.06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
