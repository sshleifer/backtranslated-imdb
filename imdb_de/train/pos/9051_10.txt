I looked at this when my wife called to ask for my fare choice in the other room. My comment? "I take care of my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only about 5 years old as the "Rocket Boys," I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our school administrators. The whole thing of the Science Fair gained momentum and brought me and others in the cyclone. My own tornado took me to '62 'in my own State Science Fair, in Physics, although our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters, whom we asked for advice and help, until our city after a tragic event so went so far that we can visit the Nike rocket site on the shores of Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie has given me everything back and I'll bet it will bring us all a few "over nerds" in the late 50s and early 60s. <br /> <br /> We are now in a similar period of brain drainage and really need this movie as a land. See it!
