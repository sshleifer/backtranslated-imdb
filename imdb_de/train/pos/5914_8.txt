MPAA: Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use. Quebec rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After seeing Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more of Bashki's films. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre, and I saw that. When the film was first released, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the movie banned. He even held protests in front of the theater where the movie was The film was only released on the VHS under the title "Street Fight". He is now considered a cult classic and African-American celebrities like comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu-Tang Clan I personally thought that Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but this movie does too have fun. Worth seeing for Bashki or Blaxploitation movie fans. The film mixes live action and animation, much like the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would have preferred it in full animation, but the film starts with a Reverend and another man who wants to rescue two of his friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the older one tells the story of three men he knew. The movie switches to animation format, we see three black men selling their house to this man. They decide to make a name for themselves in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a giant shot. The movie goes on as the Italian mafia wants to get him out. The mafia includes the godfather, his three homosexual sons, and an Italian clown. Coonskin is a fun animated film that's worth checking out if you can find it.
