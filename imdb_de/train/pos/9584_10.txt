Yes, this movie is great. Can not recommend it. Gay or Seas is a great doco for anyone who likes movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Great access. A film of passion and interest in the subject. Some performances and just amazing. If you only find this movie on VHS, it's still worth it. Great. I saw part of this document ten years ago and did not understand what I was looking at. The interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who like heavy boxers try to make their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer, what a performance. Cool. Follow it.
