I loved it because I was a fan of the original series. I've always wondered what the backstory would look like - it did not delight me. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize a person - that's refreshing, similar to BSG. It has introduced me to a whole host of new talents - I can not wait for the series to air. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and his team - outstanding work. The special effects, dialogue and acting were perfect and I felt emotionally tied in action. I know there are purists who are unlikely to agree with my assessment, but I felt Caprica was far superior to most sci-fi fabrics in the last decade.
