"Crush" examines the friendship between women and mostly avoids the quality of sugar that destroys so many films with the same theme (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events presented were highly unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very real to me. No movie for the raging vehicle and the explosion, but adult women react with laughter and tears.
