If you are a fan, you will probably enjoy it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the first movie. It's very cute, stupid, the girls are hot and fun to watch. There is no sex until the end of the 45-minute film, but the score is kitschy-trippy and the plot is not totally boring. Misty Mundaes makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is braided in awkward pigtails, so she's not as hot in this movie as in others. But her panties in this one are pretty cute (you just have to watch the movie so that does not sound weird). If you like this one you will probably like "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which looks a bit more sexual). If you prefer seeing Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / exploitation-based (but lower-budget) movies, visit the Factory 2000 website.
