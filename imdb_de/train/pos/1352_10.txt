I have never seen this movie and consider it a great classic with great actors. At the time this movie was being made, people in America were different, there was no television or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the launch of great movies shot in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories about a young romance between a young girl or boy were considered differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet," played a young orphan named Carrot Top for her red hair and was taken to a home by two elderly people who looked like two wise owls watching over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew each other, and if anything happened, the entire city would know about it within minutes. It's a down to earth movie with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very simple way. It seems very insane and stupid today, but trust me, people in the 1920s were in America. & 30's and they were a great generation who loved good family movies.
