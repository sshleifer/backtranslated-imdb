Halfway through Lajos Koltai's "Evening," a woman on her deathbed asks a figure in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman she speaks is Vanessa Redgrave, who delivers it with all simplicity, and the question rips your heart out. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the film is based on Susan Minot's novel RÃ¶cken Sentimentality and Everyday Life, it holds attention, offers admirable performances and generates emotional involvement, as few films have lately given. In just six months of the year, there are now two memorable, meaningful, and rewarding movies in the cinemas. The other is of course Sara Polley's "Away from Her". Hollywood could have turned Evening into a smooth celebrity vehicle with its two real mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in the movie (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep's younger self, while Redgrave's young incarnation is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a large cast - yes, it could have evolved into a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cameraman of "Mephisto" and director of "Fateless" - created a subtle ensemble work with a "Continental Feeling," a story set in a high-society environment in the days before New York Newport plays a wedding that's fraught with trouble. Missed connections, wrong decisions, and dutiful observance of social and family burdens are quite a soap opera, but the quality of writing, Koltai's direction, and selfless action raise "Evening" far beyond that level, into the rare atmosphere of English, French (and some American ) Family legends from a century before his contemporary background. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, all come across as understandable, captivating. Individual melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> Despite all the emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of "Evening" still seem through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new) discovery, unclear as her mother, but a very different actress ), the Danes carry the most load - until Streep shows up in the last moments and of course steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the price. <br /> <br /> As with "Away from Her," "Evening" stays with you in detail and invites you to reflect on its history and characters. experience the emotions experienced. The movie lasts a little two hours, but the way it stays with you after that is welcome among the many movies that get cold long before your popcorn.
