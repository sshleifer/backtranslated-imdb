After seeing and loving Greg Lombardo's latest movie "Knots" (he also co-wrote and directed this film), I decided to review his previous work, and this movie was worth the effort and the rent. Macbeth in Manhattan is a joker, an excellent interpretation of Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to New York. I was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script, and was impressed by the way in which the film's storyline reflects the storyline itself - and very skilfully. The trials and tribulations of Manhattan in Manhattan are similar to many Shakespearean games, and Central Park has rarely been better used than in the woods surrounding Macbeth's Castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a good place in his heart for New York and New York's stories (Knots is a witty and warm sex comedy that involves about six-thirty New Yorkers, mainly in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood, with offices in Manhattan and a loft in the city center to a good extent) and has spent a lot of time with Shakespeare's plays. The film is well-recorded and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama in the heart of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare movie "in a movie". I absolutely recommend Macbeth in Manhattan.
