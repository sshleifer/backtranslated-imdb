This is one of those movies where I felt I had to make films at all. In general, I'm a fan of films based on dignified, true stories. And that's great! Apart from Meryl's achievement, which has received much recognition and praise, the most important asset of the film is the story on which it is based. The thrilling story of a couple suffering from social and legal torture after experiencing tremendous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their toddler is really an eye-opening fantasy that uncovers the inhuman side of fellow human beings and the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society. It's interesting to see how people who consider themselves friendly and intelligent people (for example, the emotional jury ladies in the movie) are in reality nothing more than self-serving Dupes who because of their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, their brains for all Concepts would be imprisoned and contemplation, even if all facts are very clearly directed against their opinions. The other face of the so-called "civilized" society that the film reveals is the indifference to the pain of others (it is needless to say that this is very general, even if this particular story is developing in Australia), and it works as far as a true cruelty. Must see if you are ready to take something serious and maybe encourage thought.
