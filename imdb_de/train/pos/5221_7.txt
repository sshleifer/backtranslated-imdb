I did not have much interest in seeing The Flock. Andrew Lau was the co-director of the Infernal Affairs master trilogy, but he was released from The Flock and replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I felt like Lau I had made a good movie, but the study was not satisfactory, and they fired him and hired another director. This does not usually work well (remember The Invasion). But The Flock was better than expected, which I expected great movie, but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The character development is very well done, and I knew the characters very well. In addition, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and believable. Richard Gere and Claire Danes provide competent services, let's go to the negative points. One element that really bothered me (there was a moment that irritated me) was the excess of editing tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style. These tricks feel out of place your presence is arbitrary. Besides, I think the movie should have been more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. He is not memorable at all, but entertaining.
