When I flipped through the TV Guide and encountered "Twisted Desire" in the movie section, I read the description. Three words came to my mind, "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" absolutely bad, I hate this kind of program, so I thought it would be a boring old love story with her ... Little did I know. <br /> <br /> It finally started on TV, I had my bucket ready in case I giggled, it was cheesy or grumpy. At first you think that she is just a nice, ordinary girl who is in love but has my parents. If you then find out she has manipulated her friend to kill her parents so that she could be with her True Love, you are like "whoa". They just do not expect this actress to play such a role. She played her role very well in my opinion, I never thought she could act like a slut, and voila, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to you, the film was very good, I would definitely look at it again and recommend it to others.
