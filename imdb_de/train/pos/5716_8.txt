I have not seen a Japanese grudge movie yet, but I really like it. I rarely get SCARED when watching movies. I can jump if the effect and sound are amazing enough, but getting scared of a movie is a rare thing for me. But I was scared of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I saw it. I did not expect to be scared. I knew nothing about it. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you either seem to love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge movies, but even though I have not seen them yet, I think it's not right to compare every movie. This movie is on its own page. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree The story is minimalistic and made on purpose. The narrative techniques - for example, the interrupted time frame - are made perfect. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe he has developed his vision as he wanted. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. As simple as that.
