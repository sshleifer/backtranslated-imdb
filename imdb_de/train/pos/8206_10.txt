Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the fourth film of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has it, Harry has been told that he has been vacationing after some trouble due to a robbery (where the memorable slogan "Make My Day" originated!). Vacation has become a woman after a rape attack a funfair and starts to get the punks one by one. The last movie in which Sandra Locke is seen in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement to The Enforcer, which was a bit weird and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles, best known for the sunglasses Arnold Shwartzeneger wears in the Terminator. Worth a watch if you like Clint Eastwood, the Dirty Harry movies or action thrillers.
