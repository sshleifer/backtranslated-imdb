First, the only reason people curse about this movie is because they can not stand some parts of the true story that is "changed." Guess what? Peter Jackson's movie was not a perfect rendition either. Good enough to scold. This is a very nice movie. The backgrounds are beautiful and come from well-known artists from Tolkein. The film covers about half of the trilogy ("Fellowship of the Ring" and until the Battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is first-rate and most of the characters look the way I had imagined. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks great. The film has a great score that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories but do not like reading (the books are even better), try this movie. Remember that it was made 20 years ago The Fellowship follows almost exactly the same thread as Ralph Bakshis (Jackson has often said how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
