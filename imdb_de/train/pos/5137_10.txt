Interesting, fast and amusing. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watch a lot of televisions. I stumbled upon this show when I was ill one day and had a bad case of the flu. I was immediately excited. I was quite in love with John Burke. Both he and Claire co-hosted the show together. You can really say that both loved their jobs. <br /> <br /> The super collector segments were excellent. I was interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I really want to know: What happened to Jack, the dog? Did one of the hosts adopt him?
