I grew up with this movie and can remember when my brother and I played in the backyard pretending we were in Care-a-Lot. Now that so many years have passed, I can watch the movie with my daughter and see how she enjoys it. If you are a parent and you have not seen this film with your children, you should just hold them in your arms and watch as they are thrilled with the carefree bears and the many worries! The songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I warmly recommend this film to all children so they can learn how enjoyable it can be to care for others! When it comes to all the garbage on TV, you can get your kids to have the right attitude to life with films like these.
