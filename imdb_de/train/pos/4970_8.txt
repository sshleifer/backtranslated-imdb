Some critics found this movie grim, but for me there was enough humor and optimism to overcome that impression. For example, the daughter's quietly positive and stoic character is the quiet center of the film, often balancing the unfortunate aspects of the scenery and plot. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters The end result is unpredictable: I felt it could have gone both ways. By the way, many reviews I've read mention the effective use of black and white, but the print I saw featured on the Australian SBS TV network was in color. <br /> <br />
