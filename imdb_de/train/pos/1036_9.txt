Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films from World War II. Paul Lukas has certainly earned his Oscar. Bette Davis shines as a great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in this time and, of course, the great films of the late, great woman Bette Davis.
