Okay, I admit that the casting in the movie is REALLY weird - part of it is in the storyline, but I still had a hard time believing that Pierce Brosnan plays the main role (though he did a good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of an Englishman living with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. He was indeed so successful, remembering that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness walks - though he was not a mixed-blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or fake! The movie revolves around that and what happened when the joke was revealed. <br /> <br /> The acting and the attitudes were great and I really liked the movie (after I had given up the doubt of Brosnan). It was not widely circulated - probably because it was pretty cerebral - neither a Bond movie nor a romance - just a really weird film about a remarkable man.
