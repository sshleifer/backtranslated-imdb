Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Glorious, absolutely glorious ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about the indelible kinds of young Hearts, about life and lost innocence, all led by the skilled eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a great soundtrack featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche it surprises in every way and leaves the sour taste of misunderstanding of love ... Really remarkable ... Is it or is Romanian film art slowly but surely gaining ground and winning Respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two thumbs to all involved.
