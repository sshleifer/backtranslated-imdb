This film is essentially a documentation of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from 10 to 14 April 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace in Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of the film is real and you can feel the pain, the sorrow and the joy of the people who have experienced this failed coup by President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> You can not see the movie that Hugo Chavez really is a great historical person. Hugo Chavez 'Persona single-handedly persuaded the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day-old military-installed junta and restore the democratically established government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that George W Bush supported and supported the Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat. It is not surprising that the mainstream media supported and supported George W Bush. <br /> <br /> It is surprising how few people have seen this film and how few people perceive the total corruption of the American mass media. <br /> <br /> It took only twenty years for Ronald Reagan to eliminate the fairness doctrine in 1986 in order to turn America into a blind and rudderless state. <br/> <br /> May Hugo Chavez open the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
