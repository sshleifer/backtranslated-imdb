I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, firearms, fight and even a girl. In all these things it does not stand out, with the exception of the cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a little petting and a lot of car, with a big chase at the end. You can say the jump is impractical, but according to our good friends here in the IMDB, this is possible, so the movie is not as bad as people paint it. It has some quality, and I liked it. I really loved the movie. And I did not have to turn my brain off to look at it. I did not always think, "Is that possible?" or trample like that. 9 in 10.
