Dumb, funny, tragic, sad, inevitable. A group of lunatics team with an "experienced" rogue to free themselves from their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwing factor. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that George Clooney does something really funny for a change. The casting is perfect and the acting standards very high. Although it could be said that the colorful theme of the crew is not new, I think this film is treated in an interesting and unique way. Sufficient so that it stands out from the previous ones. <br /> <br /> Very well done, guys.
