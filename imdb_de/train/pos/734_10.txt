This movie is a jerk punk rock fun from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning punk rock princes of the late 70s, appear as themselves. PJ Soles plays the lead role as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n' roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school upright and encourages her fellow students to join in their cheering antics. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school that visits Riff has just hired a brand new headmaster named Ms. Togar. She is a big, intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she swears to get the students on track. She even has a few students who act as observers reporting dirt on her classmates. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to catch Reef and put an end to the anarchic phenomena of Reef. However, Reef has clever ways to thwart Togar at every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the outstanding performance of Mary Voronov in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B-movie actress. And in this film she plays the fascist woman Togar with sneering pleasure. PJ Soles as a riff brings an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as a double Eaglebauer has a lot of fun with his role. The Ramones play many of their hits in this movie. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones in the punk rock scene of the 70s were so influential. Surely this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not into the Ramones or the punk rock, this movie is an incredible blast (literally) of energetic fun.
