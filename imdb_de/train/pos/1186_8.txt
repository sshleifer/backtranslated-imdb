There has been a lot of talk about "psychological westerns", but this is one of the very few that are really in this genre. It has big stars that do a great job, but the director makes this movie so good. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of the British safari hunter to play a die-hard buffalo hunter who is venerated as one of the best in the West. Robert Taylor plays the newcomer (in contrast to the usual young climber is also Taylor's character in middle age), who wants to slaughter buffalo and Granger lures into business with him. They hire two other well-known actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, as Skinner. Granger is pursued by the buffaloes he killed, knowing he could be guilty if he died out. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it's a realistic statement, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern film created by nerds and dorks. He is insecure and needs human society. Nevertheless, he will not stop the murder. The end sets the two against each other, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well represented.
