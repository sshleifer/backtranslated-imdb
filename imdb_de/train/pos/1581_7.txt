Goebbels motivation to retreat was not investigated. After Stalingrad, the Reich had decided to pursue a "total war". This is pointed out in the film. Part of this was to involve women in the war effort, something that Germany had not done on a large scale so far. An SS massacre of women would have exposed Goebbels to massive public relations catastrophe. His preference was to eliminate the problem as quietly as possible, since the Jewish men could later be collected again and again. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the "red" Berlin had never been very enthusiastic behind the Nazis and had to be handled with care. Once again a massacre of women would have cost the National Socialists the mediocre level of support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms had stains indicating that the men who wore them were not German nationals but came from other German countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
