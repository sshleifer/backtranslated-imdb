Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well-made French melodrama. She plays a guy named Lucienne, who, although in love with a man named Andre, dreams of rising above her position in life. In a beauty contest for Miss Europe, she sees the possibility, but Andre is furious when he discovers that she has stepped in and asks her to retire. She tries to withdraw her contribution only to find that she has already been selected as Miss France and will now move on to the main competition. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss and decision passionate ending. The film is filmed very energetically by director Augusto Genina and the cinematographers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The style of film is more like modern films than the Hollywood films of the 1930s and shows the different style of Europeans. There are many fast cuts and driving shots, which are usually executed with great skill and verve. The high energy of the first third of the film disappears somewhat in the middle, but increases again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good by all clients, but Louise Brooks's is particularly memorable. Louise relies heavily on her silent screen abilities, even if it's a talkie. However, her quiet style is surprisingly contemporary and restrained, making her the transition to talkies very well. The long early scene at the show was particularly poignant when Louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation, to be trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt it ever got better. <br /> <br /> The film offers a superb finale, artfully shot, powerful and stylish. This is really one of the best things from the beginning of the movie. And the tragic story just highlights the bigger tragedy that this is the last major role for Louise Brooks. Not only was she a great beauty who looked fantastic in a bathing suit, she was really a great acting talent who basically threw everything away. We are all the poorer for that. <br /> <br /> This film is less known than its German films with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this crew is simply better at storytelling than Pabst, and while the Prix de Beaute lacks the deep moral complexity of Pabst films, it's much easier to follow and, overall, is a tighter, more focused work. And it does not hurt that Louise's vocals are played by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is a classic Louise Brooks movie worth exploring.
