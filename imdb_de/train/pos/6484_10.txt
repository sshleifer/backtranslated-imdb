I remember looking at it in the '70s - then lately borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With a break of almost 30 years, I came to a different conclusion. Most of the directors surveyed in this series - some in the center of power - such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (Chief of the German Navy) Anthony Eden (UK) - are long gone, but their first-hand accounts will continue to live generals and admirals of the NCOs, Russian civilians and concentration camp survivors are all documented here. <br /> <br /> I can remember the interview with Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 1970s). <br /> <br /> This is truly a gem and I think the producer of this series was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for this work - well deserved. <br /> <br /> When I see these few episodes from the library, I want to buy the set. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" I have given, but I have rated it Like a fine bottle of wine, it will be more appreciated with some time ...
