WARNING!!! TONTE OF DEAD GIVAWAYS !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHAT ALWAYS. <br /> <br /> There are only a few words to describe a film that claims to be the last and to come out with another; Liar, cheats, maybe even some words that can not be pronounced. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows that everyone thought the show was old and did not want to see it anymore, or people who just wanted to hold their hero (or Villian) for his last breath, this movie was <br /> This movie starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz. Then you see a kid named John Doe. Who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves the Freddy Territory. A woman, who is in a hospital / village to get children off her feet, meets this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man, a water tower and a promise to keep a secret in her head. He returns to Springwood to find out this terrifying vision and soon realizes that she is Freddy's child. And we soon realize that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a kind of host to him. And beyond that, the horror follows. This movie seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This movie has tons of humor and cameo appearances like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young Breckin Meyer, who plays a teenager who has a psychadelic vision of flowers and iron Butterfly's "In-a-gadda-da-vida" sees then stuck in a kind of super parody of Mario. This movie will either make you hate this movie or, like Kruger, more. The best of the best.
