Here is a real haunt for you. It starts with another start in the PSYCHO shower scene on campus and then gets crazier when several students and their doofy friends head south for Spring Break. The trouble starts as they drive into the Redneck County area, which Sheriff Dean has murdered. One of the college sweethearts wandering into the forest, experiencing a murder by the sheriff and blowing her head open. Then it lets go of the MACON COUNTY LINE time, while Dean hunts, catches and slaughters the witty witnesses one by one. Tony March is on the target as a bad, gun-free Dean. The overall tone of the movie is really disturbing. The end is so abrupt that you almost think the director is out of film. It is also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthrope, misogyny and nihilists around the world.
