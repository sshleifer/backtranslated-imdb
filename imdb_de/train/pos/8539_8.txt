Touching and sad movie. Describes the trials and difficulties of a writer trying to cope with the paralysis caused by a bicycle accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, whom he is often hostile to, and his interactions with other casualties, especially with a black down-and-out biker and a white suprematist biker. The film is often humorous, often sad and always believable. Get the box of Kleenex out and have a look at it on a comfortable Sunday afternoon with your partner.
