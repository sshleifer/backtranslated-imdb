Having seen only two of his pictures so far, I have agreed with Altman. Before that, I called his style of film "boring". You just have to be in the mind to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is pretty underrated and very questionably out of print. I do not think it was ever released for VHS. Why this? If all these crappy movies are released daily on DVD, will this film be left without a good reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was mostly amusing and funny for the most part. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances. There is really skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's stay in the middle of the pool is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try finding a copy of this forgotten little gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most sludges that receive DVD releases. Damn, I would be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> However, it's often on the Fox Movie Channel, so watch out.
