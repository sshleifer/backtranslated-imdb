I think those creators of the movie concept deserve much more awards than they've ever received. It's not an Oscar movie, of course, but at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I saw it in 1984 for the first time (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler (and I hope it is not), but: Imagine being responsive to your impulses. The first thought that falls in your head, the first words are spoken on the lips ... No restraint, no consciousness, nothing prevents you from saying or doing things that we know to be intelligent Adults should not say or do. If anything, this film only scratched the surface - it does not go as far as possible. <br /> <br /> In a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with recreating older "classics" to pay off today, it would not be nice to remake an older movie with modest success would it take to the next level? A little further, or even exploring what the original crew did not or could not do 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion anyway. :O)
