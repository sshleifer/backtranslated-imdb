When I saw this movie, I became very nostalgic. As a child who grew up in a rural area, I felt like I was a child again! The swimming pond (in Central Texas means "tank"), which runs like a wild spirit through the landscape! The story was very believable and I totally lost it and cried in the end. Through the pain we go through in life, life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
