Although there were some rough spots and some plotting lines that did not exactly match the character, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were in shape, and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and good as anything seen on the small screen /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan movie, but stands for itself as well as for every two-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done a wonderful job in surviving the last 7 seasons and bringing all the stars of the "best damn show on TV" to the finale of the series, which NBC has never had. True to the "murder" form, there were no happy ends, that's life. That's what has always distinguished this show from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows on TV. Kudos to the writers and performers who have done something about the series' episode and the movie that challenges TV viewers and producers alike. <br /> <br /> ** I refer to myself as a "Homicidal Maniac" reason to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **
