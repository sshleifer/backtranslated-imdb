Famous was "famous" for his suspense and his style of animated cartoon, in which the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in Famous Studios is that "virtue always triumphs." Popeye always comes in time for his spinach, Baby Huey attacks the fox, Little Audery "always learns her lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You must give them credit. As much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry," I do not think anyone at the time made a better cartoon product than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the big Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and a shining example of the best the art form had to offer.
