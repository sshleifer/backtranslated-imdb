An effective film about four cities in crisis in Appalachia is synonymous with rural depravity. Each of four business people has their darkest fears when they take a challenging whitewater ride on a river that is being replaced by a dam. As locals along the way decide to "deal" with the invaders, this leads to several deaths and many traumas for the survivors. Each of the travelers is outstanding, though Voight provides the lead and the strongest performance. The rural landscape and culture is well captured, including the stunning Duel Banjos sequence. I saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (though we both enjoyed it). I remember that Burt had a dramatic performance, Voight was already established. Not a movie you could see every week, but it has a big punch and is beautifully filmed.
