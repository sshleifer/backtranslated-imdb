I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. I try every year to see all the nominees for the best foreign film at the Oscars, including those that I know I will not like. "As it is in heaven" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds too sweet and sentimental and slow ... For my taste, which is more in the direction of original, dark and / or bold foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, a lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "As It Is In Heaven "Does not sound particularly interesting ... It was not released in the US, so I sat down and watched a VCD I found in Singapore and prepared to" delete the list ". After a boring start, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes a rare movie where you really get inspired by what's happening on screen. Weak points: The characters of the movie are pure "tribal people" - the wounded dreamer, the town bully, the battered woman, the loose woman who longs for love, the oppressed minister ... Luckily, they are mostly a sympathetic group as well as good written and handled well. Ingela Olsson would have been nominated for an Oscar as wife of the minister, Inger, if she had played in English. Strengths: The music is beautiful and the main song sung by Gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable. And look out for the 87-year-old actress Olga, who keeps up with both the dance levels and the younger ladies! I will not talk about the end, but I will say that it makes sense. There are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie and you are not quite sure why they happen. Although nothing is explained in words, it all makes sense as the films become a fitting crescendo. **** out *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I have ever seen.
