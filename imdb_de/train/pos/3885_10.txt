I was first introduced to "Eddie" by friends from across the pond, who know that I like intelligent humor. I prefer comedians who are thought-provoking, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress to Kill," Eddie offers the same kind of social watchmaking humor that stimulates your thoughts on a topic while splitting your page at the same time. There are a wide range of designs in this stand-up and they are just hysterical. The article about the decision for Engleberts artist name leaves you in stitches! <br /> <br /> Thanks to Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
