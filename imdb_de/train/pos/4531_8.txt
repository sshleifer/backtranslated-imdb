This is a Cleaver movie that shows love through the ages. The film is that Keaton was looking for a love lady in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual shaky Buster and fights against Wallace Beery for his sweetheart. Of the three periods I liked the Roman best, although I have to admit that he was also the most cheesiest. I actually liked the scenes with the lion, who was obviously a guy in costume, as well as the weird chariot race in the snow - but most of all I liked to see all of Keaton's amazing acrobats. However, all three periods were a good old-fashioned fun, and the film, while not the best, is still an extraordinary and entertaining movie. Listen!
