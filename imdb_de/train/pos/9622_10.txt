I have just seen this movie on Showtime. By chance, actually. If I had not just had 6 hours of sleep the last two days, I would not have come home from work earlier. If I had not come home early from work, I would not have seen this movie. I did not know what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the movie. It almost plays the Kevin Bacon effect. That and the causality (hence my statement above). Each character is intertwined in some way. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just wonderful. I will have to find a copy to buy.
