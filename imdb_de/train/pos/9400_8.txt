If the guy in the white suit was made in America, then you can not see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis Alec try Guinness' Sidney Stratton on size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best of Alec Guinness' films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the UK has ever produced. It fits so well into the timeframe of the new Labor government and the society it was trying to build. It's amazing how capital and work can coincide in times of crisis. Alec Guinness This gentle little snook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that never needs to be cleaned and that actually repels any kind of foreign matter the minute they touch the garment. <br /> <br /> He is a stubborn curse and succeeds. Of course, the effects are not really thought-out about how such clothing affects society. In the end, everyone follows him like a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is the hallmark of a great comedy that a potentially serious situation like this hunt, as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned, can be played with laughter. The suit by Poor Guinness is not only white and stain resistant, it also shines like a neon sign. Apart from Guinness, Cecil Parker's other best pizzas are Joan Greenwood as his siren's daughter and Ernest Thesiger, the UK's biggest clothing retailer.> <br /> <br /> Consider this, Paramount has lent this suit to Ealing and John Travolta given for Saturday Night Fever?
