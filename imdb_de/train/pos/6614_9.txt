I read that this was not good, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. I do not agree. First, it is well executed. Volckman would do well not only to try out a new technique, but also to have a focus worth thinking about: would immortality lessen the value of life? Big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he is trying to build a feeling, and he makes no compromises. This is to be welcomed. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. I've seen artists reduce a form to a minimum to create the intensity of a moment. I identify this movie with it. <br /> <br /> He's also much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoping, and Volckman's story has more meaning than Linklater's later stories of a lavish drug life. Old news. Everyone knows, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. There are many more stories with many holes that are far better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
