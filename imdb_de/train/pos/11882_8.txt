This movie was in my collection for a while, but it was not before my friend reminded me? until I decided that I should see it. I did not know much about Close to Leo? just that it should be a great movie that comes from old age and it is a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has AIDS? is Leo? The scenario revolves around the way in which Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) collides with his relative's illness. First, everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel? it is believed that he is too young to understand his brother's illness? The fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to parents' unwillingness to discuss the matter with young Marcel. I know from experience that most older people often do not want to accept the fact that even when someone is young, this does not automatically mean that they are unable to accept reality and act more appropriately than themselves Except that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, did it leave an impression on me? the way they supported their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel to Paris with Leo to meet his ex-boyfriend was quite a gesture from them? Most of the families I know are reluctant to do so. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together. You can see that they are real friends, caring about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama that I highly recommend
