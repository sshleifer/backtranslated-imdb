Well, finally I know it exists. Along with the other British contributors here on this page, I saw this on the MUST that it was just UK screening in the 70s. I remembered the title, but nowhere did I mention it to the people. It scared me (that's 2 's), but when you go to bed and whiz over your brain with Doom and listen to impending horrors, is not that the reason for a TRULY CLASSIC horror movie? I can barely remember the subtleties of the film, but I remember my trembling flesh and my heightened senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicion that this is black and white? If anyone has information on how to get a copy of it, please contact ...
