This movie is finally released on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this movie so many times and even find it topical (2003) when Italy suffers from a kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the US). I am glad that there are outcasts who are played by Mastroianni in this movie and can not sing properly anymore. Maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens how to be strong in this world and fight to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: As most people have mentioned, acting is wonderful, but the sound background is amazing. I have to assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that Machism, the distortion of reality in the ubiquitous radiochrony of Hitler's visit to Rome, can really make you tremble! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
