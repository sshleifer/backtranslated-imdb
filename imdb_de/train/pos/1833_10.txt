The basic plot here is: Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan), who owns a toy industry. In Ishwar's eyes, his son Aditya can not go wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar his son is taking the responsible path before it's too late, because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and has only 9 months left to live Son Mitali (Chopra) marries and Ishwar forgives, Aditya forgives easily, but the happy couple Aditya and Mitali come from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible. Aditya does not know his father suffers from lung cancer, and he does not know that. His father threw him out of the tube to make him more responsible. Ishwar can not bring Aditya to die with a hungry and pregnant woman. It's a race against time, so Aditya does everything to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him he'll die soon. <br /> <This movie is absolutely brilliant. This is the breakthrough in Indian cinema needed for the Bollywood industry. Shah's direction is almost flawless, but which movie has no flaws? The best part about this film is the relationship between father and son, who is a tearjerker. The song interlude is just in time, the scenery is good, the only part this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are too long jokes and annoying after a while, though All in all, this is a brilliant movie, I recommend everyone to read this report, regardless of other reviews. 9.10
