I do not know how or why this movie has a meager rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I am Curious: Blue", is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in this movie is, if you do not like the process of the movie, not like psychology or if you've been expecting a hardcore pornographic ramming. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to watch to relax; It's a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES THAT MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO ******* br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie is that it covers the entire movie within a film thing mixes, but it does that sometimes you forget that the fictions are not real <br /> The movie is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the then Social system in Sweden. Which in many ways are still relevant today. Interview with a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A story about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, who is making a film ... He is dealing with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should never be involved with people with whom he should work together. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that Vilgot is doing. It's about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), who is young and very politically active. She is doing a documentation (IE. # 1.). She also comes from old age and into her sexuality and freedom from it. <br /> <br /> The splendor and sheer brilliance of "I am Curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are put together. One moment you watch an interview about politics and the next you see what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but it does so well that sometimes you forget that it's the narrative. Another thing is the dynamics between "yellow" and "blue", which, if you see one, have to see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I'll try to explain it the best, as far as I know I did not make any other films, even though it's a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "yellow" as a living thing, actual events in 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of "blue" as all the things between the 14 scenes in "yellow" that you have not seen. This is a complete story in itself. <br /> <br /> Essentially, these are parallel films ... the same story told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I understood. Yellow "<br /> <br /> I hope that was helpful for people who are discouraged by various influences because this movie changed the way I watched the movie. <br /> <br / > Thank you for your time.
