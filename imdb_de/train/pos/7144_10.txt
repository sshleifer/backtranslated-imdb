I've seen the movie Holes and say it has to be the best movie all year round. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean, who would come up with the idea that annoying boys dig holes as punishment? Louis Sachar that's who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley should be the biggest there. Weight and size, but ZigZag / Ricky was bigger and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray / Rex should be one of the smallest guys, but it was not. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that the flashbacks were pretty convincing and long. I would rather have seen more of the present than of the past, but that's just my opinion. I particularly like the work of the guys. Like Squid / Alan, played by Jake M. Smith, he should be a moody and tough guy. Jake M. Smith played just that and did a great job, like most actors in Holes. I would say, if you have not seen any holes yet, then you should definitely see it when it comes out again.
