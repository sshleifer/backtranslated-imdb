Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show 'South Park', return with something completely different. They are creating a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is called baseketball. It's like basketball, except that the rules of baseball apply. There is another letter e in the title. Here's how you play: You just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from the shot. Sounds easy. In fact, one day I could try it On the streets, it will soon be a big success. Who would have known that two immature friends could invent a sport that was so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very crude and stupid parody full of slapstick acts of violence, which does indeed bring some laughter and a lot of entertainment. A definite recommendation for those who like slapstick and rude humor.
