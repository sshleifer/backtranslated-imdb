Eventually a good Modesty Blaise movie was released, telling not just a story, but actually the "real" story as well. I admit that it's a bad movie when you expect an action thriller, but when you stop your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will find that this is a story very close to the original by Peter O'Donnell. They have a cover story to tell how Modesty became the great person she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie that tells the true story. Some things could have been better, but if you can not forget the horrible movie of '66, this is a great movie. Are you a fan? Then sit down and relax and just enjoy the real story with a cover story to let Modesty tell her story.
