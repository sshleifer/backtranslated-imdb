*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** The Douglass Sirk Bonbon Melodrama, released in 1956 and quite racy at the time, is still a wonderful thing. The plot refers to the hustle and bustle of an oil-rich, dysfunctional Texas family, including big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic. He is played by Robert Stack in a very touching and handsome performance, and his sleepy sister Marylee played extremely well by Dorothy Malone. Ms. Malone's performance is telegraphed to her through her eyes, showing us her feelings of mainly lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies that first enters a room with eyes. Do not get me wrong now. Their performance, to say the least, is an absolute cry and one of the outstanding tasks of the Lagerschauspiel in the fifties. But it's also awful, because as sympathetic and attractive as Malone is, she is not a very good actress and she is not able to seem subtle or shady. Her appearance is of a note. She can make a bad mambo, and in a grand montage, while the loveless daddy, played by the ever-good Robert Keith, climbs to his death when he climbs a staircase, Sirk mixes it with an almost crazy Malone who orgasms Dance while he undresses. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) & Malone (who has won the prize, but should not have) are the true stars of the film who all set the hysteria, both sexually and otherwise, in motion Films, Hudson & Bacall, fade to gray and brown, which are the colors in which they are mainly costumed. Hudson, who was a better actor, received the honor for childhood, the best friend of Stack and the Stalked I love the interest of Malone, who moans and groans over most of the movie about Rock. But Hudson does not want any part of her and loves Bacall, who is married to Stack. Nobody is very happy and nobody is happy for a very long time. Stack Bacall's marriage breaks after a year, and Stack almost forgets drinking because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Bacall a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, a very intelligent man and a long and fascinating career in film and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-fifties with a series of vividly colored "women's films" or melodramas. Although they came mostly from medical materials or garbage, they became masterpieces of the genre in Sirk's hands. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he used in these films to fill his wide screens with characters that made his emotional life between crazy color combinations and lighting, making shadows and creating many specular reflections. In Written the characters always look out of windows, listen to doors or sneak around. In the end, after much violence, accidental murder, miscarriage, and more, Sirk finishes the film with a concluding and stunning scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone in a bespoke suit sitting at a desk, nestling a miniature oil well.
