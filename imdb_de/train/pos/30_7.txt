An old family story the grandfather told two young girls comes to life 16 years later when he predicted it. People are murdered, blood is spilled and rats scurry around and naked bodies are enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Did Evelyn return in revenge? Is it a conspiracy to steal an inheritance? The color is great in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, who, as far as I know, has just made another giallo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the movie was the appearance of several frames being cut out. Someone calls the police and suddenly they try to rescue Kitty.
