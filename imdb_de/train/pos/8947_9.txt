Kim Novak is a witch looking for a mortal lover, and James Stewart is her choice. Sparkling comedy of manners from the Broadway stage; shot in witch color by James Wong Howe and executed by a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as a redlitch. I love this movie, though only a few seem. Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My movie No. 5 of 1958.
