My Take: Use his familiarity with fine performances and a few exciting moments. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is being murdered for murdering the President of the United States, the first United States intelligence traitor. While his colleagues in the secret service pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocents, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but I was still entertained by THE SENTINEL. In this time when thrillers are being reduced to ridiculous and over-saturated action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good setback for all those good old political thrillers. The familiar action is highlighted by exciting sequences and great performances. Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is longtime intelligence agent Pete Garrison, who is described as part of an action to assassinate the president. Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) pursue Harrison while trying to figure out who is behind the potential assassination attempt and the traitor in the secret service. This leads to a multitude of chase scenes that are surprisingly (and fortunately) never unbelievable. The script also features a subplot in which Garrison has an affair with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Luckily, this was not unnecessary, as is most of the negotiation for these types of films. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who manages to make the movie look good. Although many have criticized it as "should be a TV movie," I do not have to agree. It's true that this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode from the TV series 24 (which made this movie very much in terms of style and star Sutherland looks similar), but still brings this film its action in serious heights and does not leave the smaller details on. The performances are fantastic (with a first-class cast that also plays a part in the by-the-number screenplay). All in all, I forgive 1/2, not perfect, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
