With this theme it is easy to make cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does an excellent job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care about, and as a result, you feel for his misery trying to live as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine he looks hot! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel for each other, and they also come into play when they just look over the breakfast table. Even the potentially kitschy signature series of corporate takeovers is believable, and you'll end up cheering! At least I did it!
