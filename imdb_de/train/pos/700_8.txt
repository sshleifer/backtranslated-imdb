An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made movie. I loved how he throws you into the main character's subconscious without confusing the viewer. - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great. I was also very impressed with the look of the film. Usually "independent films" have a grainy look, but I know what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to a full-length work by Tess Nanavati!
