This movie is almost my favorite piece of celluloid. There really is not much that I have to say here. Except perhaps "See this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", which will take you through this pretty, funny and heartrending story about the "eighth day" - your own day! <br /> <br /> In this movie, I seriously thought about how to spend my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us spend precious time doing things that we think they need to do. Either for a career or just for TV shows and ball games. What we usually miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - making a difference. Take time and space to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that's what I got from 'The Aight Day'.
