If you're a fan of Altman's great ensemble performers, as evidenced in big movies like M.A.S., Nashville, Gosford Park, and lesser-known films like A Wedding, you'll certainly be entertained by HealtH. At the heart of a health convention in which two women stand for the president, HealtH includes many of Altman's past 70s regulars, including Paul Dooley (who co-wrote the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as top-star newcomers like Lauren Bacall. James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman ensemble films, there are numerous subplots in this film, but it's not nearly as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding, but more centered, perhaps as in M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire of the health movement, filled with exaggerated, peculiar and contradictory characters. Guest stars like Dick Cavett give the story a funny comment. The entire electoral process is underlined by Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public magnetism. But the best part of this movie is the sheer fun that most people seem to have. This would be one of Altman's last films for a while!
