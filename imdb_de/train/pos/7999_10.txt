This must be one of the best, if not the best, movie I've seen in a very, very long time. Had enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and got addicted from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Added blood and blood, but brought the realistic nature of the action to the front of the film and even had a crack wanker ending for a lot of people, I should think. <br /> <br /> It is a must for everyone. Many reviews have seen filming the movie, but to be fair, most films that receive bad reviews prove to be the best. that proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
