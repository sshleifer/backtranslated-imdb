Gentleman Jim is another case of print of the legend. Errol Flynn plays the legendary boxer as a brazen, but charismatic, social climber in a boisterous conversation that's barely able to breathe. It's pointless to look for historical accuracy like Flynn's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" - this is a pure hokum, with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly elaborate scale, and Raoul Walsh's vivacious direction with a real one Feeling of energy. Flynn is still at the peak of his powers (never thought he suffered a mild heart attack during production). Alexis Smith is a beautiful romantic sparring partner and eternal buddy Alan Hale. This time, Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes over the henchmen's work, and even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier films is a bit of an excellent cameo in a dockside fight!) The 103 minutes just pass.
