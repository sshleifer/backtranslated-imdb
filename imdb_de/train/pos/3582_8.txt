Here's another movie from the 80s that most people do not know exists. This is slow, picturesque (the loving shots of Montana's landscapes are breathtaking, reminiscent of Costner's recent "Open Range", which included Robert Duval), and an emotionally satisfying movie is the perfect movie you watch one night If you cant sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood are treated with a detailed and intimate look at the grief of a family and how they come together again after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son during the hunt. The performances are first class and softly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their depictions, as are all supportive players and young actors. I especially liked that director Cain (who did not do anything special apart from the first "Young Guns") gives a little insight into the personal grief of everyone. We see not only how the death affects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle-sister, the stubborn uncle, his crazy wife and the girlfriend of the dead teenager. In essence, here we get the rural mid-western response to "normal people." There are also shadows of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in some of the stoic downhome customs of the Midwestern people depicted here, as well as the lovingly vivid imagery of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic "jerks" of the era, and it's a nice little find for you.
