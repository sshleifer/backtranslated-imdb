Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun explodes. They want to evacuate the inhabitants, but they leave the place, except for a Mr. Atoz, who runs a kind of high-tech library. Although he has tried to get a clear answer to everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to his questions and insists that they have to make a quick choice while there is still time. They have no idea what he's talking about, but they wander there as they look at the mirror-like panes of the viewer, and see images of the planet's past. Then, with a disc in the viewer, Kirk walks through the door and is magically set back in time to what would have been on Earth at the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). As McCoy and Spock follow, another disc is in the viewer and they are sent to a glacial hell. All too late, they realize that the library is a time travel machine and a repository. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoys are much more thrilled when Spock is head over heels in the legs for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this horrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very untypical for the normally logical guy. Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly imaginative writing, and the very different settings make this an extraordinary episode - a featured episode. <br /> <br /> For your information - Ian Wolfe, the outstanding character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of older movies and saw him as a supportive and small player in countless movies in the 30s and 40s. He looked much the same as in this episode of 1969. Interestingly, he continued to live, though he looked ancient for another 23 years - to die at over 95 years !!
