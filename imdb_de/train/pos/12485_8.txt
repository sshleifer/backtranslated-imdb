I have just seen this movie and have to say I was very impressed. It is very scary and has many moments that make you jump out of the seat! I had to smoke some "emergency cigarettes" to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say, maybe there were too many jump moments. It came to the point where every single new scene reached its climax with a jump and this gradually triggered the startling effect, because you came back from something they were all so well done that they kept the scary fear factor. It had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (especially the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old fashioned fear!
