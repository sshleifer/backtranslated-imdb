During the train ride through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America and Celine returns to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect and the dialogue is breathtaking. The direction is amazing and transmits the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb and select "Before Sunrise" for this major number because it is a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar with such a great script, directing and performance. I probably saw this movie for the third or fourth time yesterday, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
