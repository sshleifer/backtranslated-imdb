This is a great "little" movie. I say "small" because there are not a hundred guns or a dozen explosions like in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck today with small productions. The movie is very simple to see, the story is more of a thread than a washing machine - instead of slipping everything around, things seem to get worse as the story gets thicker. Wonderful ending, very positive. I've never read the Elmore Leonard book, but it does not differ much from the movie because it feels like I'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie.
