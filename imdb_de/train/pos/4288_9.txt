In rain or shine you enter a cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, get out right now.) The lights go off. They sit down with a piece of ice. Moving pictures flicker on the screen. You feel satisfied. In the dark you are back to the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... 24 times a second, watching the modern version of flickering flames and sharing the joy of discovering unknown twists and turns of the scenario with the rest of your clan / spectator. <br /> <br /> Those who are not satisfied with themselves should not comment. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
