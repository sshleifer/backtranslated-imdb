BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's an off-the-wall movie featuring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two smarter friends who create in their driveway a sport that becomes a national sensation. Most jokes are indeed funny, but the funniest part of the movie is when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so of course they do the craziest things that are possible. One flaw of this movie is that the tempo is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour, I asked myself, "Wow, this one?" Another funny part of the movie was how Joe and Doug Squeak, who is a hyped little guy, are constantly harassing. BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines, and it's fun to see!
