This 1986-Italian-French remake of the 1946 movie of the same name brings the heat up early and does not make us gasp. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers), who lives next to the school. One day he follows her and his stamina pays off. There is only one problem: she is engaged in a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna), who may have committed a heinous crime or not, and if he regrets, he will probably be released with one swipe on the wrist. The young woman is also a bit "funny in the head", and this is confirmed when we discover that she has seen the boy's father who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is only counterbalanced by her amazing sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the beginning, with good-looking leads and a bombshell performance by Detmers, who plays us from scene to scene like a yo-yo (as she does the boy), with enough suspense to advise us - and even after that - the end. Available in the versions R and X (!).
