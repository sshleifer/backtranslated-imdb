Anyone who does not think that Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the best films of all time must take a look at the head. It somehow manages to be completely crazy and straightforward, but also terribly knowledgeable and smart at the same time. Bogus Journey is one of those rare films that actually enhance his predecessor. He can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights are the duel with death and the end, which is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all the Matrix trash and do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
