I am an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, notably "Henry Fool" of 1997. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of this film and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot is completely different. Fay Grim (brilliantly played by the iconic Parker Posey) attempts to track down the missing person's notebooks, finding himself in the midst of conspiracy and espionage. The minor cast (most of the people in the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and a very welcome return from the 90s, indie favorite Elina Lowensohn) are outstanding and the movie has many surprises. The director claims this is part of a "Star Wars" trilogy that serves as the series's "Empire Strikes Back". If that's true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope that I do not have to wait another 10 years for this.
