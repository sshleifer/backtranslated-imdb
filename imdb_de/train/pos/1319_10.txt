This movie is a lot of fun. I recommend you to look at it yourself and then have a look again with your friends. I did it last night and it was amazing how well Norma Khouri was able to pull everyone into her world! I felt a bit strange as I watched my friends go through the same roller coaster as the first time. But everyone thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie talking about the movie 2 hours after the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a scammer almost at Norma Khouri's level, but not close to the same size. He fooled very believing and rich people in my old Berkeley CA A.A. Group where everyone else trusts. He would only "sponsor" people who seemed to be very good. Who would have thought that he had stolen more than 100,000 (in 1987, when the real money was), after only one month in the city. His victims were very fragile because they were sober in their first month or first week. He was angry with a great laugh and a great smile on his face. The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> I just found this night in a late-night movie channel, "Showtim," I think. This is always a great experience for movie fans who can be completely tempted to see and change their mind. Just drag your friends over and say nothing to them. It's a very entertaining movie that moves fast and never bores you. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all time. I believe that all great movies will eventually rise to the top. The time will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that nobody has ever heard of it, which makes the surprises even better in a way. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST WATCH THIS FILM!
