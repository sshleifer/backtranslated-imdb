This was the first of Panahi's films that I saw, I saw him at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was totally fascinated by the different characters he creates, how different they are from Australian children, and how similar they behave on other levels. I think if more people could see such films, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism, which can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are obviously big political differences between the Oz culture and the Iranian culture, but I found the subtle differences between the characters that this film is so successful on the screen so fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem so unique to me. I found the characters convincing.
