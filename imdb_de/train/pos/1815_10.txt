"May contain spoilers" * <br /> <br /> "All dogs go to heaven" is a great movie. I saw him in 1989 when I was two years old. I did not understand it that well, but as I've seen it, I've started loving more and more. I love the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You're Come Home". These are beautiful songs. The only thing that bothers me The movie dies Charlie. When I was little, my sister could not even see this part. Apart from the fact that this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around The sky is beautiful in the movie and the "clocks" are very smart. I love Itchy too, I even have 3 own dachshunds. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love this movie I suggest everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
