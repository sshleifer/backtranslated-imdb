Now and then comes a movie that raises the bar for every other movie in its genre. A film of this caliber will influence many films after its release over many years. "A Chinese ghost story" falls into this category. It is probably one of the best horror movies of the eighties; possibly one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have created a movie that thrills every horror fanatic. The story is captivating and original. The bad guys are appropriately threatening and scary. The sets are scary and atmospheric. There is even a bit of blood and blood to satisfy the Splatter fan of the house. But do not let the horror label put you off unless you're a fan of the genre. This movie easily fits in many different categories. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter has cleverly combined drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance genres into one delicious deluxe movie pizza. "A Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful epic love story that, thankfully, is narrated without the nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have destroyed many Hollywood love stories. Those who are deterred by the romantic elements of history can sit back and enjoy the fast sword fighting and "wire-fu". If that's not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma offer enough humorous situations to whet your appetite for comedy. This movie offers something for every movie fan. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark put together a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not possibly think of any actor other than Cheung who could have performed Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang charms as Lit Su Seen, the enslaved ghost stealing the heart from Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title character is really haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is funny as the naughty Taoist helping the young lovers. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, this film is very impressive even by today's standards. The direction is excellent. I hope that today's Hollywood executives are looking for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching, who are more likely to use the usual MTV video or commercial Pepsi directors. The cinematography is beautiful. You have to praise any cameraman who makes a movie look good when most of his shooting scenes take place in the middle of the night. The special effect make-up is first class. In fact, most of the creature effects in this movie destroy the humble CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror movies sequels, a full-length animated movie, and countless imitations. However, none of the subsequent or copied films could capture the magic of this classic. This movie is for any horror fan or anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of their time watching. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
