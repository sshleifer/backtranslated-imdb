This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but should not be. The only thing I did not like was the girl who relied too much on the guy. However, it represents the temporal way of thinking. I tried to get this movie for so long that it was only available in the UK for the US format and can not be played on US DVD players. It is unfortunately an overlooked classic movie! Believe it or not, but this movie could quickly become a cult favorite for all ages. Too bad we do not legalize certain things that could really save small or our own countries. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character who makes lemon from lemonade. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
