I have to say, I totally loved the movie. It had fun moments, some heartwarming parts, just fine everywhere. Personally, I really liked the movie because it can finally relate to my childhood. In my opinion, this film is aimed more at the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy would be treated when growing up. All the mocking, naming, and non-knowledge is something I'll always remember, like most other young women, and finally a movie that shows how hard it really is to get gay. So, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. It probably should not really be viewed until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
