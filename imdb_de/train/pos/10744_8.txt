The events of September 11, 2001 need no particular human interest in the training of the novice firefighter or in the progress of the two French brothers. In my view, it would have been better to omit this. I think the directors have tried too hard, maybe they felt that the events of the day needed a story as background. A policeman's comment - "this is not the world of Disneyworld" - is apt. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a convincing view of events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right time. No other material of the day corresponds to what they have absorbed.
