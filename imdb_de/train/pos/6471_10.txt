A OUR GANG comedy short. <br /> <br /> The gang forces Spanky to look at her younger siblings. Taking care of these FORGOTTEN BABIES turns out to be quite a chore, so the little pincers have no choice but to find some clever solutions to the babysitting problem in this funny little movie, arguably its best. Highlight: Spanky tells the story of the TARZAN movie he recently saw for the toddler audience. Film lovers will recognize Billy Gilbert's voice in the radio drama.
