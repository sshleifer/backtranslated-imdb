What the movie The 60s really is (for those of us who were grumbling in America's belly at the time) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical characters, the genuineness of the problems remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only these radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two fundamental things changed our world at that time: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms began with social changes that were soon institutionalized. Out of the chaos came the sensibility, out of the disorder came the values. Remember, however, that the majority of Americans were not involved ... They worked, played, saw the news ... and were slowly being affected by the efforts and struggles of minorities ... civil rights workers, political activists, the anti-war effort, the war on poverty ... <br /> <br /> Especially the representation of the power of the press and the television was reflected well, although the conflict between the public opinion and those who wanted to change something , was at best ignored ... and misrepresented at worst. They were confused too. Let's not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the Beatles began an attack that killed the folk protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie or just a mention of it. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you have not lived through the decade, you may not have a feeling for what the movie is about, and overall picture is a bit dark. Once I held a steady job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At other times I was in Haight Asbury and the Detroit Riots, while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The film shows three siblings of a middle-class family. They represent the hippie child, political activists and active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes, and mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and sometimes compromise ... for peace. <br /> <br /> The black family consists of a minister and his son ... disproportionate. In my opinion. I assume that the producers knew all variables and had to deal with restrictions, otherwise the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger generates bitterness and bitterness chaos. It was clearly a message to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems and also how we share the themes ... The 60s were unusual in this way and only compare the roaring twenties. In other words, this movie has a morality. In the end, our collective individualism survives. Put that in your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> In the 60s everyone was a god, a guru or a free-spirited genius. It was a time of magic and madness. Nobody will ever really hit the 60s ... it was too diverse (this movie is scarce). At the very least, we can say that we are not ashamed, that we have learned and grown from it, and that, for once, a generation has shaped America and changed it ... for the better.
