I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a bony movie - it really stayed with me. Very cleverly adapted from a probably outstanding novel, it's a drama back and forth, with completely rounded characters, thoughtful thinking about the choices of life, and I'm not exaggerating. one of the biggest cast ever in more than 100 years of film art. Wonderful work of all, led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a dying, deluded Newport matron and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Mamie Gummer, the daughter of Meryl Streep, is like Mama the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not surpass the charm. and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins delivering sharp, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not bring much of an advantage to the somewhat clich√©d role of an unfortunate rich craft. But it's a deliberately exciting, visually great meditation on real life issues, and you can cry and not feel like you're being manipulated lightly. Also what a splendid parade of automobiles of the 1940s / 50s.
