It seems that even the director does not like this movie, but for me he is a bit hard on himself. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not perfect, but there are a few atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to interest you throughout. <br /> <br /> It's filmed in a pretty village, adding to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies made in England, try it. <br /> <br /> I just saw a trailer for this latest movie "The Devil's Chair", which looks pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> There are not enough English horror films for me so all who come are deserving of our attention and this is not as bad as you might think
