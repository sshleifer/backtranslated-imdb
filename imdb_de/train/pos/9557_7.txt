I love this anime! I laughed my head with all the jokes and violence (mainly from Akane Ranma's reluctant but entertaining "fianc√©"), but Ranma deserves it, but he's trying his best to make it better. The main character Ranma travels to China only to train to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo spring, and becomes a girl when she is splashed with cold water. From then on, pure chaos is one after the other. Among the standouts are Kuno and Kodachi's confused brother and sister duo, the sexy shampoo, the perverse Happosai, who all cause trouble for our hero / heroine. However, it is Ranma's selfish father Genma who most of the time blames it for chaos. If someone wants an anime that's funny, he's the one. It is cuter and better with the Japanese dub.
