Todd Rohal is a great genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most accomplished short film, has a fancy sense of humor and will leave a lot of scratching. What the movie is about, and he almost certainly would not agree with me, how a regular Joe feels confident that he's going through life with inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short film occasionally turns on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and catch it if you can - you'll be glad you did. It is strange. Also check out Todd's other short films that occasionally pop up here and there: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
