This is probably a very good "sequel", better than the first live-action movie 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and a real slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has undergone a major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very nice to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of a dog Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe that. Others, such as Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that it has changed. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dipstick and his buddy have given birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Performers Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another villain, the name should give a hint) This is a good family movie with excitement and much more !! One drawback to this movie is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but not as excessive as the last movie. This is also funnier than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
