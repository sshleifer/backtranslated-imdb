A story about an attempt by Mars to colonize the earth. (On Mars, it must be pretty bad.) Two state forces investigate the scene of a UFO crash. What has landed is buried under the ice in Tracy's Pond, but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> The restaurant has had no customers since eleven o'clock this morning. Now a handful of bus passengers are waiting to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not realize who they were. The problem is that now SEVEN people are waiting for the journey to resume. One of them is an alien, but which one? Everyone is suspicious. There is, of course, the crazy old man (Jack Elam), who seems to be playing a subterranean joke. There is a busy businessman who needs to go to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple in the honeymoon. (Great play by husband Ron Kipling.) No one else has noticed except the couple. And even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride to freshly minted husband: "I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin." The story continues in a sparkling, but somewhat sinister, way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the jukebox switches on - and none of this is to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble game, and the revelation is worth a giggle. There is no recognizable "depth". It is not a moral message that pod people disguise themselves as ordinary citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that distracts and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always like it when it's running. It is particularly interesting to see John Hoyt as the agitated and impatient businessman who knew he was the Roman senator in 1954, coining the murder of Julius Caesar in MGM's version of Shakespeare's play. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
