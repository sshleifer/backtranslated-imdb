Reign Over Me (titled Who title) is a movie that will surely bring a tear to everyone. It was a moving story about a guy (Sandler) who lost his family in the World Trade Center 9-11 attacks. Years later, he meets an old college roommate (Cheadle), whom he does not even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress caused by the loss of his family. The two kindle their old friendship and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes that he has to get Sandler's character Fineman before it's too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It's absolutely worth seeing, and once I've seen it, I'm sure the viewer will appreciate his family much more.
