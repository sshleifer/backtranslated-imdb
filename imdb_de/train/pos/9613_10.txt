It's hard to describe mistakes in words, it's one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. The following is a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I've recently seen in a Hollywood release. Since his characters react in different ways to the chain of events, and the events determine different ways the characters should follow, the audience is just an observer. The almost pro-narrative narrative flow of thoughts to thoughts, the very spontaneous matter of the script will make you stick to the screen and wait eagerly for how it all works in the end. And as for the thematic elements ... there is a certain sequence in the film that goes from melancholic to bright and beautiful to tragic, all within a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It recalls why independent film is perhaps the brightest star in the film industry. Maybe people will attract attention with more movies about the quality of bugs.
