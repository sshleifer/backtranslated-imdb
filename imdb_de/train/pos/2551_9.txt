This almost unknown jewel is based on a French farce - which turns out to be a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is wooed by a rich Argentine (Roland), who asks her father for marriage in her marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and immediately enters an audience-focused reminder of the last time Caroline decided she was in love with another: a dilettante sculptor (Gardiner ). The film tells the story of Anthony's strategy to decouple Caroline from her sculptor and how this experience supports him with her Argentine. <br /> <br /> It is perfectly staffed: Ronald Colman is at his most refined and charming Reginald Gardiner is at his best, Gilbert Roland from his most exotic and Anna Lee is just wonderfully whimsical. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produces); the whole production feels like a love job. There are wonderful touches, such as For example, the Colman frame that appeals to the camera and the extraordinary use of a sliding door. It's a sin that it was not released on DVD - this is the kind of movie that can arouse the interest in classic film on its own.
