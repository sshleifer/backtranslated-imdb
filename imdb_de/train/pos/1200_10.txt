Make no illusions, this is a moral story. Granger is the disturbed ex-buffalo hunter, who was once again put back into the plane by killing Taylor. Granger can see that the end is near, and feels deeply responsible for the cost of chasing the herds, the Indians, and the land itself. Granted, Taylor equates killing buffaloes or Indians with "being with a woman". While Granger's role as the tortured hunter is magnificent, Taylor steals the show as the denied, unethical "Everyman" for the fast price and good times. There is not much Bang Bang here, but the story is moving fast and we are served by Nolan with a good character performance. The theme of this story is as poignant today as it is in the relationship of the nineteenth century to the land and what lies on it, and to racism. Considering when this happened, the censors must have wriggled their handkerchief during the scenes in the "bawdy house," Taylor's relationship with the Squaw and much of the dialogue. Although it's a downbeat, this is really a great western picture.
