"Slaughter High" is a completely ridiculous slasher strip about a high school nerd Marty who is constantly being grabbed by some rogues. The prank goes awry and he is brutally burned. Five years later, all tormentors visit a reunion. Of course only the ten, and lo and behold, Marty kills them one after the other. The British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as a heroine (who dies anyway!). Acting is completely awful, there is not Anywhere are many grotesque death scenes to satisfy the Gore freaks: one man explodes, another female victim literally gets an acid bath, a couple who has sex in bed is electrocuted Man is crushed by a tractor, a girl is drowned bruised, and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye. The killer wears a decent and pretty spooky fool mask and the environment (a beautiful old english castle) is really nice. However, the dream final is absolutely pathetic. All in all, it's "Slaughter High" is a junk, but I enjoyed it. Only for fans of really bad slasher flicks.
