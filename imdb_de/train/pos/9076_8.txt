This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms that have come from the States since the sinking of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always funny, and this complements the rest of the ensemble to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my merry bones with his unique charisma of his lines. After raving about the British series "Coupling", I can see where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" had their original idea, but this is not meant as a "brickyard" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the path to it upgraded this special series completely. However, it takes more than a competent cast to bring a new series to success, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been part of a professional TV comedy writing team in Australia for almost seven years, I particularly appreciate the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the camera crews. One of the few complaints I have with the series is the obviously "canned" laugh. During the filming of the series could certainly have a live audience can be used.
