First of all, this is really my favorite movie. I do not have to give anyone a description, as this does every hole. I'm literally obsessed with this virtually bloodless, cheesy, lame effect with 'Boom Stick Show', poorly crafted, 80's metal horror masterpiece. The director (as I've heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so he could do sequels and get a FREDDY / JASON deal for himself. Damn, I wish it could have worked that way! The soundtrack beats'. Acting is good ... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and all diehard fans can chat and chat via email. Midgetorgy ... I can be found at YAHOO.
