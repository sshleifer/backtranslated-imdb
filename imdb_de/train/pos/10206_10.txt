In my years of participating in film festivals, I've seen a lot of little films like this, which never get theatrical distribution, and they end up in WalMart's 3-dollar cans. I just found a DVD of Yank Tanks there, great doc. But how sad that she ends up as the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie it's all. I would have preferred New Yorker Films to have translated the title directly. It is good for the Americans to stretch a bit. If the title of the film helps the US audience explore random chaos, so much the better. Cinema mimics life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> I also found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to understand, and the gringo audience is expected to pay. In a movie, especially a film shot in Paris, the viewer should not be spoiled by the memory of it: I am an American watching a movie, and he translates the Euros for me in dollars. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more of the writer and director.
