Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series that takes place in post-apocalyptic Seattle and focuses on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, who absorbs herself before her creators (not as much as Buffy says, but absorbs anyway ) with interesting and credible characters. Certainly it is not for everyone, but those who have the time will look at one of the most beautiful series in the world. Dark Angel is criminally overlooked and undervalued and unfortunately canceled after only 2 series. What a pity, because this series had the potential to become a great show, even though their 42 episodes are only 10 seconds ahead of the BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. Since Dark Angel remains unfinished, pick it, and if you want more, ask Fox to make another series.
