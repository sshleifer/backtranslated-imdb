I saw it on TV last night and was pretty excited. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of movie in which you feel completely comfortable and believe that there is still something good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what Grace did, um Help her and protect her - the old policeman is my favorite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic picturesque English coastal town), but the best thing about the movie was the joke and humor! Do you just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies drinking their "tea"? <br /> <br /> Maybe the end was a bit confusing, but it did not stop me from really enjoying the whole story!
