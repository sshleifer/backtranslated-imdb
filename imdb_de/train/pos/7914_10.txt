I probably saw this movie for the first time around 1995. Since then, I have often returned there. It is great! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Impressive! That was so cool in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me because I know that the movie "Tron" was shot 7 years before my time. However, this film was a milestone in the early nineties. It was probably the first collaboration of various CG experiments that were put together for music. I like it so much, I think I'll see it now. bye
