Standard rise to a fame story that has some highlights. Number one, Lonette McKee as sister, who gives a stunning star-making performance. The fact that she never became a big sensation after that does not go beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supportive character, and we need to focus on Irena Carter's bland character Sparkle, whose fame is light, boring and unconvincing. Whenever the girls go on stage and perform, the movie comes alive again. The original music of Curis Mayfield must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS cassette. The image quality was pretty low, as well as the production values ​​I value. All in all, it is worth a look.
