The horse is indeed a beautiful animal. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is just amazing. The fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that encourages the horses through the stroke. This applies even more when the stallion crosses a varied terrain and jumps over cliffs and bold waters. <br /> <br /> Also the soundtrack is very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music attracts the film. <br /> <br /> "They say the history of the West has been written from the saddle of a horse." Well, the story of a good horse was certainly written from the saddle of the West. All in all, this movie is clearly the best there. Would be a very good choice on a lonely night. A simple 9/10.
