This is on my top list of all the favorite movies of all time! It's a fantastic and insightful movie. It was historically interesting and nice to look at! I found the acting of Emily Blunt fantastic and Rupert Friend a fantastic Albert. The best actor was selected for Albert. The costumes were beautiful and the settings and scenes like the opera house were incredible and detailed. I just loved it, everything! I loved the childhood scenes in which she was "bullied" by John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to go upstairs with an adult. Again, the authors have done it! You produced this fantastic screenplay! <br /> <br /> The awards you have received are absolutely deserved. (Oscar and BAFTA winning Sandy Powell for costume design, a BAFTA for the best make-up and hair, an Oscar for the best in Art Direction, the best in costume design, the best in makeup.) Design, also nominated for the best actress Emily Blunt CDG for outstanding costumes for the film - period Hamptons International Film Awards for an audience award for the best narrative film PFCS for the best costume design. VFCC for Best Actress Emily Blunt.) A total of 10 victories and 11 nominations! That is really good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Take a look for yourself, it's really interesting! Personally, Rupert Friend should have an award.
