I also saw that at a screening last night. I was thrilled with how much better this movie was than I expected. Not many films can combine dark comedy and current event drama and do not let it fall into the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I will not bother reconstructing the plot too much, because I think the less you know about this movie in it makes it much better. But I will say that the performance of Adam Sandler was really refreshing and real. He was funny and a lot funnier than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was credible as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good pace. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed for most of the movie. Halfway, the movie slows down to address the dramatic end of things, and makes it really good to tie everything together. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it is really cool, instead of playing the whole black friend / white friendly thing, that they decide to ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
