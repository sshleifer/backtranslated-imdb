*** 1/2 From ***** While I am not concerned with the fact that this would have mentioned an English dubbed version as some critics, it should be noted, as it seems to live in many Quebecois native heart. However, this was a movie as a child that I was a passionate admirer; If you consider that it was made for children, I rate it relative. The story is about children who build a fantastic snow place during the winter break and who provide themselves with weapons such as snowballs and other supplies, idle hands, and winter schooling on an equal footing. If I had children, it would be definitely a movie that I would try to interest them, for the Snow Fort impressed me in my youth, and I think even children would agree today, albeit with Pixar and all the computer animation, I might be out of date and just do not notice it. Moreover, the message of the film is wonderful allegorical and positive for children (and adults).
