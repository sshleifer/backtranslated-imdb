From the first scene you will get hints about what is going on here. It's getting more and more obvious the further the story goes. The drama is consistently excellent and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what would happen, the motive was very baffled. I'm still confused as to why Ben did what he did. We could see "second thoughts" in his face, but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his feelings and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it confused me. Maybe that was the point of the movie. I liked the movie and Wil Smith can pick up another good movie choice. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
