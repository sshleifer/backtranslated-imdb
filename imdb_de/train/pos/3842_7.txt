An occasionally surrealist thriller that will push the buttons for most people. The 4th man will surely offend anyone who has a taste for the politically correct. The protagonist of the story is the bisexual Catholic alcoholics Gerard (crab) with a completely twisted imagination. Verhoeven offers <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything that is not right with the modern man. He is immobile, mad, unable to control his urge to be afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and he's completely apathetic towards life in general. As the character himself once said, he is a professional liar and can not remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gerard, who dreams of spiders who eat Christ, and then wakes up to begin the long march to his own destruction He hunts <br /> <br /> a man ( probably a friend) and chasing another at a train station. Later, at a lecture he meets a woman who wants to help him, or <br /> <br /> maybe she nefarious plans. She quickly takes Gerard into her net and lures him with sex and money. much of both. She also has secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely and really looking for someone who can care for them - or is it a deadly black widow who lures Gerard his death? Will Garard be the fourth man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk) and Verhoeven does its best to guess what she's up to. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie with lots of sex and intrigue. It is similar to Verhoeven's Basic Instinct, but has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There is very strong gay content that can make some audiences wind up. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent <br /> <br /> psychological thrillers or anyone looking for something completely new.
