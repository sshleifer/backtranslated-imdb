Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes play a 1938 comedy based on a play in The Divorce of Lady X. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the London fog is too dense for a costume ball's guests to go home. The next day, Lord Mere (Richardson), a friend of his, announces that his wife (Barnes) has stayed with another man in the same hotel and he wants to divorce her. Olivier thinks the woman is Oberon and panics. Oberon, the single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends to be Lady Mere as a questionable lady, if she really is Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We have seen this act or variations of it dozens of times. It's wonderful with this cast. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, the great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is amazingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her role the right light touch. She looks very young here, full in the face, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears beautiful street clothes, though her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries on, she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is adorable like the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color is a mess, and as others have already mentioned, they could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
