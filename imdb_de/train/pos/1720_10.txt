This early biographer short was a lot of fun. The second on the CD by D.W. Griffith's DVD "Years of Discovery" (highly recommended) features three outstanding performances of the lead roles, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a camper musician eyeing a countess (and others things). <br /> <br /> The countess's husband rages over his wife's betrayal and has her obedient in a small room. It's kind of unbelievable that they do not hear the wall, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (father of dumb player Raymond Hackett) wildly gestures and this raises the melodrama in an unexpectedly funny way. The best moment comes in the end. When the lady faints in shock and fear, Henry picks up his instrument and "fanning" it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a weird way sexy, and I just lost it and laughed off my head. The expression on his face! From that moment on, I was fascinated by Henry B. Walthall.
