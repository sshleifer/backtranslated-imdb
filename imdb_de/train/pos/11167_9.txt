A favorite of mine, this film tells of two feudal New York "characters", Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), both of whom wanted to be the "Main Guy" in the Bowery in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, though this is a highly fictional account of their antics (based on a play). Brodie's legend (he did) "- it's still an argument!" Jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here as at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898) , Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the era, so beautifully recreated here, and it contains a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is best as Brodie and Beery again shows what a smart actor Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest that the two boys pursue. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike many early "talkies"). It's not a simple movie, but it's worth paying attention to.
