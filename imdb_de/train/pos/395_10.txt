Impressive and full of Eastern philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is presented by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films produced by Hong Kong cinema. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it's a refreshing change from movies that treat their audience as idiots. If thinking is not your strength, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should check out the latest from the Hollywood studio, but there's no brain club, but if you're looking for something more, you'll find it there.
