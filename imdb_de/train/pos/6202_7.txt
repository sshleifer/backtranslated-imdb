When I started watching Fay Grim, I had no idea that it was a sequel to Henry Fool. Well, the latter was not a movie that I envisioned as a sequel. But one thing has arrived and it's pretty good. I assume that you have seen the original, so I will not explain it. This begins with Fay (Parker Posey), who lives with her son, whom she had with Deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day the son is expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. However, this is not an ordinary toy. It contains a secret that explains much of what happened in the first film. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm pretty impressed with what Hal Hartley did here. Maybe this does not quite reach the quality of the original, but it is certainly a look at what's going on in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel. <br /> <br /> Also with Jeff Goldblum.
