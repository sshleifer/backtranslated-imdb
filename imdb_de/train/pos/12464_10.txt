Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what more could you ask for? Based on the award-winning novel of the same name, Monkey Grip explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mom who falls in love with the heroin-addicted Jobe (Friels).) A simple story is made possible by the all-around great spectacle (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and nice use of the budget The only mistake (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although the movie was shot mainly in Sydney for budgetary reasons, so in some scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton post office ( Sydney-scenes). Apart from that, "Monkey Grip" is a must have (excuse the clique, but it does) for an award-winning performance by former "Play" presenter Noni Hazlehurst of School "and" Better Homes & Gardens.
