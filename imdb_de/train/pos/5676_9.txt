SERIES THREE BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want to do something right, kill Baldrick before you start." In the second series, the show returned to the current owner of the famous name and served as butler to Prince Regent, one vain and stupid foil for Blackadders poison, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow like the other piece of the comic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, after all, they had now found the formula for success, why things change. We see Blackadder, in a much more subtle way, trying to get rich from the credulous regent's back by trying to get Bladrick into a M.P. or make a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate of the series. Historically, the Prince Regent has taken control of the throne during his father's madness and some of the mocked characters tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit, and Wellington all go through the events, and they all manage to steal their scenes, which is not an easy task with such a stellar cast
