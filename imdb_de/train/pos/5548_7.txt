Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant Clarence Brown, who are responsible for editing - give this story of poor, isolated Scottish Islanders great beauty and intelligence - the same area Michael Powell took to be 20 years later would be his first big hit. Visions of wind and wave, sun-hungry silhouettes of lovers not only complete the story, they are the story of the struggle against the need. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of proud people into their roles and Pickford is brilliant. Her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan, oscillating between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's bullwhip, the stubborn islanders Church strikes, sitting there with her guest's walking stick like a scepter in her hand and talking about her lover, played by Matt, Moore. <br /> <br /> Find out if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried, but failed.
