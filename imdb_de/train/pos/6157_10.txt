This is a movie I'd never thought of until my 3-year-old spotted him in the video library and grabbed him on the cover of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We got it and have seen it ever since; In fact, we have rented it since then several times. There are very few non-animated films that my son will see and pay attention to. What a nice change from Dumbo and the little mermaid. The acting is outstanding, the songs are captivating, they go deep in the head and you can not help but sing along. The storyline is timeless in its own way and there is always something new to see. I heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest whatsoever in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that kids want to see over and over, and parents do not mind sticking to it. There are days when we look at it before nap and at bedtime, and I do not feel moan coming when trying to repeat another movie.
