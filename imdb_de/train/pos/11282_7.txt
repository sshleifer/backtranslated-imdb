This was the second part of the series of 6 "classic Tarzan" films starring Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this was a wonderful movie in this series; and perhaps as an "intermediate film" in a progression that could almost illustrate the development of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it showed a good pace, though not as well as the subsequent films. Likewise, the cinematography is less accomplished than later Tarzan films of this series. The stock I saw was of uneven quality and contained some grainy landscapes as well as underexposed and overexposed scenes. The crisp presentation of later Tarzan films is missing here. On the other hand, there is a scene very early in which the jerking motion of a camera with the leaves floating in front of it while the camera moves backwards, showing Safari men advancing into the jungle, almost in their state Modern were style and in stark contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, an interesting feature here was Jane's almost impermanence and inconsistency when she was subjected to flirtations. The kiss ?? and Jane is stunned and partially guilty, reaction? something from the Jane that we will see in these films in the future as well. Compare for example in Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's duplicitous acts that trick Tarzan and hand him over to his family. Later, she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. There is nothing quite different here, but we have Jane, who returns to Jane Parker yesterday, and in an almost repentant series of actions gets rid of the gown brought by Martin and Harry to lure them away from Tarzan br /> There was a whole series of images and sequences that particularly impressed me in this regard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the picture we get of Tarzan's domestic life, here and later, is a combination of sensual idyll and always the possibility of a violent death. This is very important to me for the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan, who leads the elephants into the valley of the elephant cemetery; Tarzan was rescued by the hippopotamus from the watery death and then kept healthy by the monkeys; The cheetah will find Tarzan if Jane and the other men are locked at the foot of the wall; Especially cheetah crossing the river on the log. The last fighting scenes of savages and lions on the ground and savages and great apes in the trees. Jane shows us that she really belongs to Tarzan's world, and quickly shows her enterprising wood to keep the lions from a line of fire. <br /> <br /> The last scene is great: suddenly Tarzan On the scene, they hurl savages from the trees and take over the lions, and call the elephants to the rescue! This last triumph of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside him, is an unforgettable picture and a truly beautiful summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
