Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy, violent character and JT Walsh's insidiousness. <br /> <br /> A drifter is mistaken for a hit-man and tries to make a little dough out, but over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when Cage got on a trailer in Wyoming, with the help of his buddy ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing ! But this is another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is in good shape ... unconventional, one step ahead, vicious, seething and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also well suited as a man with a dark past who tries to live lawfully (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters here except for the tough ones in Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turn comes in early, and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts.
