If Marion Davies used to have her Druthers and not just William Randolph Hearst, she'd have made more films like Show People and been happier. Seeing her make her first major breakthrough in the two-reel comedy, she'd rather have done that in her career than with such epics as "When the Knighthood was in Flower" and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see among all the people in Show People is the real Davies, a gifted Comedienne, a great imitation, and a generous, kind-hearted person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper alias Patricia Prepoire, she gave herself with her pretense in her Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the plot of Show People got into the legitimate stage you would call it's a backstage story. I think it's one of the first movies about the movies you could call behind the camera story. Marion is a hopeful young hope, who like so many others comes to Hollywood and is looking for a big breakthrough. She wants drama, but her introduction to the movies is the foil for the burlesque comics. She gets her share of cake and Seltzer in the face, but learns their craft. And also wins the heart of the young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> It has its first major breakthrough, but for Haines this is not the case, and Marion can play a legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli, playing Andre Telfair, pretending that there is no account count of Avignon. Someone here was focused on actor Lou Tellegen, the lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others, and to hear about it was one of the most despised people in the cinema. Show People was one of the first films to feature the unrated cameo appearances by themselves. You'll see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc. who are in and around the film colony themselves. This makes Show People a movie worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show People also used the standard Tin Pan Alley songs like Is not We Got Fun. You would be surprised, California, here I come. When the movie was about to be released, a song called Crossroads was introduced. It's not a bad number, but the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack will not get recognition. I believe that since they are not seen, it was not necessary that a settlement was necessary. Still, I would like to know, and I'm sure you would, if you're lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see why Marion Davies loved this movie so much and was considered a personal favorite. She looks so at home in this movie and her real lack of pretense affects her performance, making her a real treat for the audience.
