This movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a full action action packed with tons of weapons and explosions. This movie had a surprising number of good twists and turns. The plot is solid, although others think it has held my interest until the very end. Finally; This is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time with.
