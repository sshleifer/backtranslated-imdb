I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive chain of Varount houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer organ? also magnificently restored - this was used to accompany the silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We were lucky enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at Mighty Wurlitzer, fit to play music and thematic compositions that fit the action of the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative, and the entire experience provided a unique chance to see a silent film as it should be seen. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American movie. She was only 20 years old, but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. <br /> <br /> It's ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; Although the powerful Wurlitzer immensely enriched the staging, it was necessary to leave a lot to the imagination. Modern viewers understand silent films for the most part not ?? The spectacle was different at that time, with extended gestures and broad facial expressions. That's why the audience laughs at inappropriate times? Acting is considered "hammam" and exaggerated. But it was just the style of the time. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, has done much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volume could be read at a glance down or a simple shrug. It exemplifies the truism that "a picture is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Although this is Garbo's first American movie, it's pretty obvious the studio knew what it was about: this was the MGM movie making it's the best. The sets and costumes were great. The special effects ?? which is pretty weak by today's standards ?? were still electrifying and amazing. <br /> <br /> The screenplay by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) seems to be tailor-made for Garbo; It shows its strengths, increases its fortune and there is no annoying language problem that needs to be addressed: A Swedish actress can play a Spanish seductress without being exposed to unbelief Reply to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and has done something that few romantic stars of the day would ever have done in a movie: Allow yourself to look inactive, look stupid, and grow old. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good things character parts that look more than adequate? especially considering the powerhouse that Garbo was. To name are, among others, Lucien Littlefield as "Cupido" and Martha Mattox as "Do√±a Bernarda Brull". This is when the extraordinary cinematographer William H. Daniels Garbo met. They made 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer in 157 films and his career lasted five decades!) He captured her ethereal beauty and his photography was primarily responsible for the artist through whom she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his great abilities, she would not have been the success she was. <br /> <br /> It's a rare opportunity to see this movie: If you ever get the chance, you should not miss it.
