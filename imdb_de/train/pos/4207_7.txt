Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) picks up the wallet of Candy (Jean Peters), which contains an important microfiche intended for the communist cause. She is being followed by two federal agents who are waiting to topple as soon as she gives her contact with the microfiche. Nevertheless, Skip steals the purse under the noses of the subway and starts looking for him from the police as well as Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want the microfiche back. Skip can only be tracked by Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about criminals. Skip makes it clear that what he stole is important and both sides want the film, but he wants to stick for a high price. This causes Joey to chase after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well-rehearsed movie and it has a good start to being involved right away. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters instantly falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary because otherwise she would stay out of Joey. It's a good movie.
