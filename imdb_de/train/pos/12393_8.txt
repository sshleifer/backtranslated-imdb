For those of you who want to know exactly how humanity has been wrapped in big red pods that crave pomegranate, there is the duo of shorts "Second Renaissance". I'm not quite sure why they're split into two parts, mostly because they are labeled as one on the DVD (and are these shorts viewed in a format other than the DVD?), But they're also informative when they have a few gaps. <br /> <br /> What really characterizes this first part, including the rest of the animations, are the parallels between the robot uprising and civil rights. Graphical tributes to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves mingle with verbal references to the Million Man March and the God complex of humanity. In fact, "God" is never really referenced by these short films, instead replaced by "One's own image of man." <br /> <br /> As far as the short films are included in the collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is by far the most effective emotion. It is a sad and disturbing view of mankind's potential to become "the architect of its own destruction." Some of these concepts can be dismissed from some concepts that pull this short line straight out of the previously established science-fiction literature, but that's basically what most of the Matrix series did, and it's a driving force behind their success. > <br /> - PolarisDiB
