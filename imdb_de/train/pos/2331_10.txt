At first I was stunned that the main character of a television program could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I would try. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I look forward to Wednesday nights, just to watch it. Then I look at the next week a few times on my DVR. The colorful characters, funny bantering, fast dialogues and new, unique situations attract and captivate me from start to finish. Ned and Chuck Charles's relationship is interesting to watch as they work on their romance so that they can not have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cod has grown in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She tears me! The narrator's voice is fun, and the cinematography gives me the impression that I watch a movie rather than a television program. I have recommended to my family and friends to turn on "Pushing Daisies" and they are also addicted !!! It pays to wait a week for a new episode and if you have "P.D." have not seen, I can only recommend the shipment!
