I have to admit, from the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, it has to be the one I love the most, and another that I've also discussed. History is something that really makes you observe. Many of the EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer would have broken it to pieces before production when you saw it. It's all about sex and who can end the movie with how many different people. And oh god, never watch one of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work that it's almost ridiculous, but you do not want to waste the energy for it. <br /> <br /> Losing Control is exactly what its name is. The protagonist, the main character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control that a person has over their senses, their body and their emotions. And a man changes everything for her, almost turning her into another woman. But at the same time the mirror is shattered. This makes a great movie that I wish I had turned up first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
