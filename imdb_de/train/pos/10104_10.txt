The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar, and all the chemistry, come into their own, as does the minimalist approach to storytelling and directing by Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like this. It's a whole, every piece fits so well into the storyline. You can not be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri resigns as an imperious husband and "Baap" from Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man trapped between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives the film with its smiling and soft-talking villain the right note. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shettyy at Sadhashiv is absolutely stunning. Smita Patil does not play a major role, but she does not detract from the main story. <br /> <br /> And what's more, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has come to terms with the system and its way of working. To say the right things in the right places and to know how to stay away from difficulties. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him when he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film focuses not only on the difficulties of a police officer trying to fulfill his duty, but also on the other brutalities in police custody. Om Puri captures hopelessness and a burning desire to free himself from this extraordinary achievement in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treat for all the enthusiastic fans of Indian cinema.
