My siblings and I came across The Champions when our local station provided repetitions in the '70s of a summer. We absolutely loved it. It was something so exotic and mysterious, especially when compared to the usual American repetitions (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not a big surprise as it was also British and was in the spy / adventure genre). I would like to see it again now - hopefully holding. I have told this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I had imagined its very existence. But the wonder that the Internet is has enabled me to find information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
