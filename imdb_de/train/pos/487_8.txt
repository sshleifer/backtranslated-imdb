The film of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story draws the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> John Turturro gives what is probably his best role to date (thankfully they did not give it to Ralph Fiennes who killed them.) Similarly, Emily Watson shows the richness of her experience ( from her outstanding stage background). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro), her character must show both intelligence and the love of a woman. Although Watson does not portray beauty pageant sexuality, it does bring a tantalizing self-confidence to its parts. <br /> <br /> At a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she occasionally prevents him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothes - a custom-made piece that, as we later recall recognize in the film, his hopes and aspirations symbolizes. Later, as her love affair develops, she subtly compares dancing to chess (Lushin has learned dancing, but never with a partner); She encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant moves," allowing him to relax enough to play best in the future (and also recognize herself as her lover). <br /> <br /> This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest accomplishment and finds her deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or so we're supposed to believe - surely Natalia is more likely to be liberated within the time frame Woman as one.) Someone brushing herself to a stereotypical wife and mother). <br /> <br /> The Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a pleasure for the intelligent moviegoer, but the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and rightly so. Chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for the development of an emotional and emotional film, though the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed. Although the tragedy is a notable highlight of a classic, the final resolution is surprisingly uplifting.
