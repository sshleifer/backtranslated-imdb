"The Luzhin Defense" is a movie worthy of any time. It's a brooding, intense movie that kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his depiction of a delicate, eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson is fascinating as a gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly regarded Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the canvas is evident as soon as their characters meet in the story. All in all, this film is one of the best insights into the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson give the film a very different, non-clich√©d atmosphere. Most people come from theatrical thinking and feel touched by this brilliant view of the most unlikely love stories.
