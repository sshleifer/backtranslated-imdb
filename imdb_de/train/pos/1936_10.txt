This independent film was one of the best films I ever saw at the Tall Grass Film Festival. I loved it. There are so many things that make the movie great, in addition to all the trimmings and the cast that I've had the opportunity to meet was absolutely phenomenal. I found Avi great in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to his role as a Disney actor. I was amazed at his talent for being able to switch from a cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role, without a hitch. You want to watch an independent movie. This is one you should really see. I believe that Mr. Gruver would have been so proud to have such a template in his festival, and his parents loved the movie so much that he won the crowd-pleaser they visited and saw it again. It was really a great movie, it was dark and funny and sad and genuinely emotional. It was just fantastic. I'm honestly just so excited about this movie and I really do not want to spoil it for anyone who really sees it and really loves it. I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to visit places, and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
