This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the hearts of the audience. He directed this wonderful picture, in which life is considered through Paul's mind and heart. From time to time we discover with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John that even little creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not stop my tears, though the movie has a happy ending. That's great, after thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is the second picture after "Ugly Duckling" that really turned me on its head.
