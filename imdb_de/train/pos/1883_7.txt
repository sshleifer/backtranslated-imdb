Outstanding comedy with Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnelli and the good-spoken John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man of a multi-millionaire family who got nearly $ 750 million, assuming he married a woman (Susan) from another multi-millionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the terms, but he finally refused when he met the cute and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he just enjoyed drinking heavily and having fun with prostitutes. After some serious thoughts in his life and for the first time Arthur decided to marry Susan just minutes before her wedding. The end pleased Linda and Arthur, although he knew that his life would change in the near future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone. Rich people are usually not satisfied with their way of life.
