War drama, which takes place in 1971 in Louisiana. It follows a series of recruits through basic education and then Tigerland - an accurate representation of Vietnam on American soil before being shipped. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... getting together, making friends and dealing with a Corporal Relay Leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a Border Psycho (Shea Wingham). <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera and digital video for the fight scenes throughout most of the film. It works very well - the movie looks grim (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully hides his Irish brogue and has a pretty convincing southern accent. His performance is just great - he's an extremely talented young man. Unfortunately Davis is not so good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very bland. The rest of the cast, though, is just great. <br /> <br /> This movie was thrown away from his studio. It had no stars, a family history and was considered "just another war movie". It only played in Boston for a week! It pays to watch video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Also Farrell and Davis have a long nude scene.
