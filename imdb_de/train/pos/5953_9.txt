I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with the Rodgers and Hart score, but could not resolve the copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote most of the songs for Bing Crosby, contributed a very nice score , <Br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin and said that this movie "suits Crosby like a glove" and I could not have said it any better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949, Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood. Paramount once used Technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never more beautiful on screen. This was a woman invented for Technicolor. <br /> <br /> William Bendix Brooklyn origins stand out a bit, but it has a good comic effect. Trio Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a great time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. The third song he sings Once and For Always is sung by himself and Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song, but did not lose Baby It Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It's great that Bing recorded the score for Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope I like the road pictures, but Bing was a weird talent in his own right and this movie shows up better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
