The film is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Ives and tells the story of a young French hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic Wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a POW camp in the Scottish Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). and discovers that his long-lost grandfather, who fled France during the revolution, lives up the street! Lively performances by all actors and some memorable lines make this offer an above-average offer.
