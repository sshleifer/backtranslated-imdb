This movie is a must for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the perspective of the soldier, as well as anyone in America. The previous reviewer totally missed the point - to clarify the truth of how to teach our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists but who only live in the territory of our "enemy" and what they do to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY before another person is killed or injured. This also shows that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally injured, with ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder or with physically lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
