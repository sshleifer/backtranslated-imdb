(Some Corruptors) I have not read the James M. Cain novel ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this film is based. Therefore, I can not compare this movie version with her, but I have seen and loved the US version of 1946 (also titled "Postman"). <br /> <br /> Even better is this jewel from Italy, which, as I read, was "maimed" on average because of too many obvious references to the fascist regime. Well no matter ?? What remains is a beautiful piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neorealist movement in filmmaking. You can certainly see why? Despite all the harsh editing work, a pervasive sense of social and cultural as well as personal oppression remains, which hangs heavily over the protagonists, who therefore come across many borders in life. <br /> <br /> Consider the young Gino Drifter, not well-educated, unemployed, and persuading people to jam, steal, and destroy people to get through, being a pair of shoes so worn out that they are practical are useless. In Giovanna he sees a way out, but he should have gone further, for Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her work (working in the trattoria for her husband, behind the bar and in the kitchen) her sex In the past, she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> Under the pretense of helping Bregana repair his car and send him to the village to buy a needed part (which he actually has in his pocket). Gino wins Bregana's favor (also promises to fix the broken water pump - water symbolizes life or its lack) and stays alone with Giovanna. They immediately begin a heated, passionate yet volatile love affair. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels repressed by the relationship and feels in need of moving on as Giovanna suggests selling her husband. Since Gino does not want any of this, he leaves the city on a train ride that he can not afford. He is kindly paid by another gypsy called Spagnolo, a fellow traveler. For Gino, Spagnolo means a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morale and conscience), travel together and work together on a carnival. After all, Gino has a permanent job. To his dismay (he has not yet ignored his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and persuade Bregana Gino to "go home" to live and work with them again To have. <br /> <br /> Too weak to resist knowing that he and Giovanna will reunite, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple. After a while he gives Gina's demands to get rid of her husband. Once the evil deed is accomplished, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seems to have a very slight conscience, while guilt and shame eat Gino for hurting a man who has never harmed him. As much as he wants to leave her? He does it again briefly, they are now inextricably linked and have to face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the Spagnolo character returned to Ginos life to act as judge over his misdeeds? that was very good and interesting and added another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the '46 American version with Lana Turner and John Garfield is getting a little lost in a swamp of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the US The lawyers are well advised by Ossessione much more focus on the psychological effects of the crime alone on the lovers. This gives the final result an even stronger effect and makes a powerful statement that enhances the helplessness inherent in society in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> One small point of criticism: the time that (almost no) time passes before immortal love is pronounced by the lovers, how fast they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the US version ); Gino's very fast relationship with the dancer / hooker? They quickly admit to their love and she is ready to risk much for a man she has just met! ?? everything rather unrealistic, right? I found this time problem quite distracting. I had to think that I missed something somewhere. Otherwise, the time of the viewer is worthwhile. The acting and the directing were consistently equally good. Recommended.
