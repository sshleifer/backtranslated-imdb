For the first time, I saw this jewel of Joe Sarno, and I have to say that I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the movie was moving a bit slower than I would have expected for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer performed, I was in the square the first time I saw her, and became attentive. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid, and she spices up every scene she's involved in. I've seen most of Sarno's other films and the other films with Jennifer Welles or with her, and I have to say that these were both Sarno and Jennifer at their best. Sarno's direction in this film about the drama of domestic adults is great, and Jennifer (figuratively and in the truest sense of the word) showed a theatrical ability that makes it a must. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent co-stars of Ms. Welles, but also frequent stars of Sarno's work, provide credible performances as adventurous, but normal housewives. This movie is Sarno classic.
