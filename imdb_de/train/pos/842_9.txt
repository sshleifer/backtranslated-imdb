The Matador is a witty, dark humor and exciting melodrama that goes far beyond mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been bettered here, and the ever-reliable Greg Kinnear, who has since played his best role Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor plays in As Good As It Gets. A big plus is also the writing. Brosnan provides an intelligent and occasionally very unpleasant dialogue, and the slow friendship between these two individuals is absolutely convincing. The story takes a few unexpected twists and makes the viewer constantly guess where to go next. <br /> <br /> The artistic accents of the director such as good use of music, sophisticated editing and sometimes a little unorthodox cinematography make a beautiful sound for the film and for a long time you do not really know how to label the film. But that's also thanks to a very well-written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of the seat.
