I remember that I liked this more than Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds, when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have impacted on release in the US to avoid confusion for his broad Hispanic audience, has the cartoon of director debut production Conan. In fact, Pazu jumped the fat bones and the immortal vitality of Conan - the thousand stories with his girl in his arms, landed on his feet and then ran. This makes him the most animated and enjoyable character to watch. Nausica's techies may be disappointed with the flying beetles and retro technology in Laputa - the only exception being the robot. In contrast to Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the topic in Laputa is not directly related to environmental protection. If it has an issue at all, it's anti-warfare. The importance of natural life - this is related to the flying castle, is disgustingly briefly discussed and not really pursued. Overall, I now see the piece at an interface between well-being and git.
