Loved the movie. Loved the two families in the story. The only question is if Sam is killed. How is his family going? He is the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero is supposed to be related, but does not mention any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have you never mentioned other children or wives before talking to the teacher and falling in love with him? Maybe she had a child before she kissed Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. I just loved it. The acting was great. I'm not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir, who ended Marion's wife, but makes his character even funnier. The other "counselor" seemed worried for the kids, but maybe not so much. The poor guardian must have had a really stinking childhood to be so mean when she grew up.
