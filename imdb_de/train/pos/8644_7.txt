**** = A masterpiece that will be included in the books and will never be forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; just a must <br /> <br /> *** = A solid, rewarding and very entertaining piece. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but there are some unequal elements or noticeable flaws <br /> <br /> ** = Can still be considered good in certain areas, but these Work either has serious problems or is constrained by unavoidable elements that are considered essential (eg, genre). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing triggered by mild, rewarding moments. <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible quality. <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> - Unrated (for strong violent material, considerable sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I rented this movie and was expecting one Brad Pitt's in-your-face summer blockbuster quality party, but was happily surprised and disappointed. This is really more of a drama and very bleak about it ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voices. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his possibly most exotic movie ever to be played with amazing talent. Anyone who started out as a hopeless but harmless "white garbage" husband was recognized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a confused mind. During the final stages of the film, I found it hard to keep watching - it was unpredictable and weird. This proves very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of bizarre, sensational scenes in which I've held my breath no less than once, and I do not mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes that are so brilliantly designed that I actually twitched and gasped at what I saw. It was like watching a rhinoceros and a lion sitting in a cage, watching each other gnaw each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the screenwriters; Whoever made the impossible possible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also really enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare for this talented young actress that she is performing so well nowadays that she is so pleased. Some of her moments in this movie have moved me to tears. I mean that. The emotions this girl can arouse in your mind are incredible, and I remember perfectly well that on some occasions I had blurry eyes. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I'm deceiving the artisanal quality of filmmakers "KALIFORNIA" is only rated ***. But the dark emotions that arouse it are too strong and depressing to make it. However, I think everyone should see this movie. I really do it.
