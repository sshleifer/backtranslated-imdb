This film is an amusing and absolutely sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photography, which consisted of vivid colors and twisted shots, especially if you think this is Zukovic's first great attempt. A warning, do not take the message of the movie so seriously. It's not meant for mass consumption (and that's not a compliment). The message is a somewhat stylized neophyte view of post-college society. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot of a fictitious "zine editor" who verbally lashed the mobocracy of the 90s.
