This movie was seen by my wife and me when he came out in 1978. He was a revelation for us. We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect it and maybe you do not want to. But we both chose this love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it has never changed our sexual orientation. This stuff is for the Christian Wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we get older, we no longer have extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far-fetched. However, the idea of ​​becoming heterosexuals seems rather unrealistic. My wife and I have slept together for the past 40 years. We are still gay. End of the story.
