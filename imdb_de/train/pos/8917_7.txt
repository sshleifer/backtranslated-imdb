A meteorite falls into the land of a small town and brings along a jelly creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and adolescents Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) bring him to Dr. T. Halls (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats the bladder carefully and asks Steve to examine the place where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the residents, but no one believes in it, while the blob devours many people and gets bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and a classic sci-fi. It's a low budget movie featuring many hamm actors and actresses (except Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but also sexy and very, but very funny. This is the first time I've seen this classic (I saw the 1988 remake of Kevin Dillon) and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and Sci-Fi B movies from the 1950s. The movie theme of my review number 1,400 could not be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
