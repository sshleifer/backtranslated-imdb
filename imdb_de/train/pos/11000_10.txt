If you've come to the movie with expectations, throw it away now, because no hype will do justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> Dividing this movie into a single genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, with elements of noir, action and action, science fiction and cyberpunk combined with a brilliant narrative, mind-blowing plot and great cinematography. <br /> <br /> The comments focused on other films being distracted in a good and bad way. But as they say, every crib of Shakespeare, so as soon as you can overcome that, is a hell of a ride. <br /> <br /> In some places, you will have to put your disbelief off, and while the set never gets unbelievable, there are parts (read: the elevator) that suffer from a low budget and some cheesy visuals. Do not misunderstand that this is on the same level as cheesy sci-fi channel movies, as this is on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn away. That's pure psychology. But if you're ready to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a whole new theatrical experience, then do it NOW! Watch this movie now, before it gets cool to see it!
