This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you look at it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... Of course you must know that the film is stupid and very poorly directed (Tomba / What a couple), and that is probably the worse movie that World, but you can enjoy it very much. We saw it 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first when the criminals kill Alex's boyfriend, and he tries to act in desperation, and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then he shows Leva (Antevleva, what a name ) the "Palassio di giusstissia" and then the accident of Leva, who once drove her car out of the street, and a second later the car is completely empty! What magic!
