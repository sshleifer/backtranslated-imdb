I do not often give a movie or show, but this show touched a nerve like no other show. I found the entire series on mysoju.com and found the premise interesting, so I looked. I was not disappointed with what I saw. I was touched. This story remains on the tender side as the main characters move through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, thoughtfully played by Koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to avoid trouble. Nobody really wants to interpret his soul in front of a perspective partner. Instead, she replaces a human, played by a lovable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. The difference; He can fight back in the same way, after all Momo is a man and not a dog. Being treated like a pet, he responds to situations where a dog might react. She spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo gets jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between the two begins to become - Momo is a dance wonder. Her thinking changes slowly as we begin to get a glimpse of his own thoughts. Matsumoto leads us from a character that is initially very one-dimensional, to a three-dimensional character when we see him as a dancer, when we see him as a man and not a dog for his master. In my opinion, it is worth seeing this story just to see how this character develops. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you almost wish you had one too. Nobody wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but when Momo (the name she calls him, as they would call her new puppy) says ?? We both knew that this would not last. Look at this show open-minded, it's worth it.
