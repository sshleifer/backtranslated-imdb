First of all, there are NO ways the remake can be so good because Japanese society differs from ours and plays such a big role in the film, as explained in the opening speech. It adds to the humor and warmth of this movie. There are a number of different supporting characters / personalities. Everyone has done their part to make this movie wonderful. This movie is full of comedies that are not as vulgar as any of today's "gross comedies". Nevertheless, it can still happen that you laugh out loud. The reality is that in real life you have no choice with whom you work with or with ... etc ... go to school. This film really underlines this and shows that people's natural well-being can overcome minor differences. Not to mention, it's a great subplot and a lot of humor. This is a story about the dance that actually has a story and a good one as well. There are some back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main story. Really a well written movie. Dancing is great too. By chance, I'm a fan of any movie with dance of any kind for that aspect. However, this movie goes beyond any other with dancing, in the fact that it is a story first and happens to be written about dancing in Japanese society. We recommend. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
