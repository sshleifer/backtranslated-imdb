This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (of heterosexuals). The film treats the taboo subject, so that even a general public who has no knowledge of transvestism, strongly sympathizes with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and should not be forgotten for this brilliant drama. The direction of Christopher Monger is very sensitive and handles such a difficult topic very well, packed in a good story. No big movie and no "art" movie, but a small, beautiful movie!
