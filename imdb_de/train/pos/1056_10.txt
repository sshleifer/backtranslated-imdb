As anyone can tell, that's bad, I do not care. I loved this show before I even saw it. For three reasons: 1. The story fascinated me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and watch the whole first season before deciding it's bad, because I know that when you watch the first season you'll love it and buy Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD and then join campaign for the 3rd season! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I am sure that many "Dark Angel" fans hate her as well. You have one thing for Canning Good Shows! Do not you all agree?
