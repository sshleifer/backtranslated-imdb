Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a crazy sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This crazy, surreal way of filmmaking is appealing, but it's hard to create or easily forget this substance, and characters who actually have souls are What gives such a film depth. Without that, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. It may laugh, but it goes through you like half a good hamburger ... more ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not want to change someone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They sneak up on you. I started this movie and thought, "Oh, I understand - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup." And it is - but if you pay attention, there are subtext and character moments that fill it. In this sense, the film breathes. It makes suggestions that take a break - if they're available to see them - and then, of course, it's going on in an incredibly funny way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign the contract to expose the belief in the moments of the movie. Switching between reality and surreality is one of the points in this film. Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the dining room are an absolute SKY. <br /> <br /> Put on your seatbelt.
