I thought "The River of Souls" was a very good Babylon 5 movie with extraordinary performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were a consequence of the series (without humor), this would probably be one of my favorite stories in the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've always favored Scoggins over Christian, even though he was granted JMS did not write them that much for most of the time and she had to endure the Byron / telepath plot. If you take out the dingy humor about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in these scenes, then this movie is a solid stuff. Probably my third darling of the four films, but not bad at all.
