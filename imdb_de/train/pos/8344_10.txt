This is one of my favorites of all time. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and that's it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters, "Do you think what I think?" And Ed says, "What are the chances?" ! "In my opinion, a movie is fabulous if you can watch it over and over again and have the same amount of fun, and with this movie you can do that !! I also really enjoyed Walter M's way of portraying Einstein. I think all the characters go together really well and the story goes well, there are so many times that I'm smiling directly at the movie and quoting my favorite lines as I look at it! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and now and then enjoys a romantic comedy.
