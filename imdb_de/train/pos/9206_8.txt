We can not find movies about the brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema or other languages ​​or media. This relationship has several aspects that have not been exploited in films or novels. Typically, a sister is portrayed as a pile-on who can demand ransom at the peak. This film deals with the topic in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> Inspired by George Eliot's novel "The Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, all the best, the blue-eyed boy, who is a conventionally good son and a darling of his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of society. Nevertheless, the love of the siblings is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of the two siblings, who are separated in childhood, and find the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the endeavor of the subjugated brother to unite with his sister, who has decided to go wild to defy the world. Nevertheless, the feelings are the same and still apply.
