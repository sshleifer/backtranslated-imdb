All dogs go to heaven - the cutest animated movie that had dogs in 1989. The previous Don Bluth movie The Land Before Time (1988) became a hit. Dogs are as cute as little mice. Aw, I just want to hug you when you're cute. Where was I? Oh yeah. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly voiced and the songs are sweet and touching. It opened in November 17, 1989, the same date as the Little Mermaid, which was produced by Walt Disney. Carface is so mean because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! The Love Survive Song by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All Dogs Go To Heaven is the best animated movie of all time.
