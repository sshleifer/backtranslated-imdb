Above all, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly miscast as Alyce, the young Briton who holds the title role. Fontaine makes a captivating image here as a heroine, but her theatrical inexperience shows poorly and her dancing is better left unmentioned. Luckily, she has continued to improve. <br /> <br /> But here it is FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the top billing - and they are excellent. Fans of Burns & Allen will be surprised how easily they fit in Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is the great fun house routine that won the choreographer Hermes Pans and the Oscar. They meet with Astaire in the most imaginative highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not much can be said for the slow pace of the story - not even for the outdated situations where much patience is required from the viewer. It has to be said that part of the humor subsides and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in every Fred Astaire movie of that time are treated conventionally. Only the musical interludes give the story the necessary boost. <br /> <br /> Some pleasant Gershwin tunes sometimes pop up, but not all get the treatment they deserve. The handsome minor cast includes Reginald Gardiner, who was at his best in a sophisticated comic performance as Best Servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father was kept as Astaire's gardener) Whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were on their radio and television days. Both are astonishingly adept at keeping pace with Astaire's footwork. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine's dance number with Fred is filmed at a discrete distance, but skillful camerawork can not disguise the fact she's out of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something she does painfully aware.
