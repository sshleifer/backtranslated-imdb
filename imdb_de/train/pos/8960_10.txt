While this is not war and peace, the two Academy Noms would not have appeared if James Wong Howe had not been brilliant. This is one of the few films that I have. I fell in love as a child and went back without dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in fictional offers or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it's his best job, I'm certainly not an expert. but the look of this movie is amazing. I love everything about it. Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy Hoo-Doo, the retro downtown. But the way she was shown in the movie is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the disagreements listed on this page above and the "special effects" that are now backward. It all creates a truly consistent world.
