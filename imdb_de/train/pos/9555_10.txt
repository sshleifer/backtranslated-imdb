I saw this movie on TNT 12 years ago. It was Susanah York's birthday and they showed this film as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since then. I was interested in this movie because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, as Lusty the sailor. I think Dale is now doing the story of the Harry Potter books about Casette, but he's still pretty funny. This is a fast comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures was to go over their film collection and consider restoring this film and releasing it on DVD. Christopher Plummer is funny as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite funny as Ramble, the sailor. This is a wild comedy, a kind of movie you can not see anymore, with big production values. *** 1/2 star outside of ****
