Tigerland follows the life of a group of recently recruited men into the army, who are called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, the Americans know that they are having a losing battle, and the director takes over. We filmed a 16-mm documentary about the lives of several recruits at Tigerland Training Camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more of a character study, not a plot, but a key character, Roland Boz, an unassailable but intelligent man who just wants to escape from the camp. We are led by several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and especially about the army in general. and very memorable. The film and style work of the directors also works so well because they are very similar to the old footage you always see in Vietnam. It's great to see how the film shows that all the battles and problems were so important to the problems of this struggle. The scene in which Boz moves away from a training mission where an instructor demonstrates how a radio is used as a torture device summarizes everything about the war ... and it's pointless. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not just about Nam, but about who the individual has to decide what is morally right by being in the army. <br /> <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
