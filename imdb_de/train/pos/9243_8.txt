Do not listen to the many bitter and disgusting comments that have surfaced in this movie. Simply put, as far as ninja movies are concerned, this is as good as it gets for my friends! <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's stupid, yes the acting and the script are absolutely cruel, but with bubblegum - it's so much fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-movies, the terrible "drama" (which in the case of the film in question is really one of the worst I've ever seen, the joy of seeing!) Serves as a ridiculous "plot" only to increase the enjoyment level tenfold. <br /> <br /> Of course the fight scenes are the main attraction in this case and for the most part I am pleased to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we observe that Ninja does not seem to be through the normal laws of gravity is restricted ....) <br /> <br /> Trust me, if you are a fan of Ninja films and have not seen Sakura Killers do it, then you really miss what my Opinion is one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre.
