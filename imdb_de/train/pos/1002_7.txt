Only two comments .... SEVEN years apart? Hardly any proof of the relentless pulling power of the film! As mentioned earlier, the low budget 13 GANTRY ROW status is a deciding factor for the limited attractiveness. However, the matter is not unfounded - either as entertainment or as a nightmare in itself. <br /> <br /> True, the most fundamental action is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - just without much horror More a case of intrigue! Gibney might have made a more rewarding impression if she had played Halifax - a couple of seemingly incoherent murders with the "house" as the prime suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall production at a high level. The viewer just can not get involved in the decisive moments. <br /> <br /> After picking up the DVD in my regular video store last week for only $ 3.95, I can not afford the expense. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
