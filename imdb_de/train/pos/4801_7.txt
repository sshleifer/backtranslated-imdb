I saw this with my whole family when I was nine years old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father who said, "it could have happened like that - Adam and Eve". I vividly remember the scene when Adam finds Eva, her eyes blackened. I asked my dad why her eyes were blackened and he said she was tired and hungry. After not seeing this episode for 45 years, I still vividly remember it - the home-planet television broadcasts, scenes of bombshells shaking headquarters, and the last scene of the two leaving, Adam with his pack and Eva. It was not a theatrical work of art, but it has certainly impressed me over the years.
