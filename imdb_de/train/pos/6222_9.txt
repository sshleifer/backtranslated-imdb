This is really a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dance of Fred and Ginger is one of their best. But basically, all films by Fred and Ginger are the same. After singing and dancing, it's the other characters in the movie who make the film work. What really bothers me is why are all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the film's negotiation are the reasons why I look at it over and over again. He adds to this film, he does not distract. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my list of the ten best favorites ever. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. Okay, he's not really a good actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc., he was very likable and could come up on certain occasions. All the films by Fred and Ginger had subplots that depended on other actors to fill in the gap between the music numbers. Otherwise, the film would have to be shortened by half an hour. I only wish that more people would appreciate Randy and I felt the need to stand up for him.
