Years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was so rewarded that I found it. It's a wonderful parade of soaps, with jealousy, the usual insecurities of the actors and all sorts of adorable excesses. But above all an amazing cast and an incredible script. How did anyone make all these top-notch actors play in such a stupid movie? And how did this little film make writers write the perfect lines? I've never heard anyone talking about this movie, or even listened to it, but it's wonderful and I highly recommend it. Sometimes I throw it at the house cleaning and sit on the couch, watch, laugh and enjoy the whole thing wonderful. Congratulations to all who did it.
