With partial rebuilding and partly direct shooting, the directors produced an impressively clear documentary about a coup d'Ã©tat against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign intelligence service and by the wealthy Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the church (a cynically laughing Cardinal) and the U.S. government. It was another chapter in the history of American foreign policy that Steven Kinzer called a "rollover" or "sowing of American-style democracy." In fact, this intervention, supported from the outside, was not only a coup against President Chavez, but also against the democratic majority that voted for him. <br /> <br /> That it's a brilliant documentary is immensely confirmed by the violent reactions to and against the Internet. As St. Augustine said, "People love the truth when they immerse it in their light; They hate it when they turn out to be wrong. "<br /> <br /> This film is a must for anyone who wants to understand the world in which we live.
