Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock are in the past glaciation of a planet while Captain Kirk is in the same colonial era. However, the former couple has the most time. In addition to the minus temperatures and the sanctuary, which can only be found in caves, there is a third resident, the beautiful and sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to turn to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors. He is attracted to Zarabeth in a natural way and throws "Beware of the Wind" because he has ever left this place. Only with the constant "memories" of Dr. McCoy holds Spock to some understanding of reality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few times when the character shows some "emotions" and Nimoy (Spock). It plays to the limit and almost comes to defeat the bees of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly from the previous episode, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one. <br /> <br /> The multi-year "old man" Ian Wolfe rates the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian who has sent the trio back in time.
