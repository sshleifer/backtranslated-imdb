Breathtaking Absolutely breathtaking. This is a movie about two children whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims an angel visits him and tells him he has to kill "demons". Later, he receives instructions, and they begin to pull together the demons that are normal humans to the naked eye. They kill these so-called demons with an ax on the head and hack them and bury them in the rose garden. Her father claims he can see her sins when he touches her. The movie continues with a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the weakness of human perception. Is her dad crazy? Or does he tell the truth? The audience has to decide. Make your own judgment and watch the movie. Now.
