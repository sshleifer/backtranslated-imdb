After what was considered the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer (1976), became the final chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and dirtier than ever since the original 1971 classic. Dirty Harry has killed a psychopath killer, guard policemen and Vietnamese terrorists in the past. But now he is looking for a new murderer, a murderer who wants to enjoy himself by shooting down his attackers. Sudden Impact adds a new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan finds herself in a new murder case involving a woman orbiting (played by Sondra Locke) who was brutally raped along with her traumatized sister. Ten years later, she wants to take revenge by shooting down her attackers. Although Callahan has been in trouble by his superiors, he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack in which even the rabble hunts him. So, to subside the heat in the city, Harry is able to vacation in a coastal city, but at the same time, the raped victim is also in town as he chases the attackers one by one. Harry is in the preliminary investigation and finds the murders very similar, since he is on the trail of the murderer at home. Sudden Impact, in my opinion, must be one of my top ten revenge films, the second-best Dirty Harry movie, far better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool together. Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with entertaining values. <br /> <br /> So you feel happy, punk?
