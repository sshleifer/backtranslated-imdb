Although time has revealed how some of the effects were made, this story of love and adventure is still something special. If you've never seen this movie, you're shocked at how much of it was later stolen by filmmakers. I looked at this with a friend who wondered how much Disney's Aladdin was begged out of the movie. They loved the movie and rejoiced that it was such a touchstone to so many other filmmakers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. There lives a good part of this movie because in the last 15 minutes the movie is falling apart in tempo. Everything is rushed, as if they had to come to an end suddenly. From the departure of the djinn to the end it seems to be more sketch than finished painting. The movie is not killed, but it is weakened. <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves a fairy tale or even a great movie, it's still a must.
