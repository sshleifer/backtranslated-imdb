I somehow missed this movie when it came out and just discovered it last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate dramatic movie that does so many things so well. The writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced and even restrained. The cinematography and the cut are unobtrusive, but inspired. Thus, visual storytelling can be dominated by wonderful close-ups and framing of images. Loneliness and alienation are captured in a memorable way. The spectacle is also wonderful. All characters become painfully real and vulnerable in the most intriguing way a movie can deliver. They show their innermost weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and the rest of the team. A must for serious movie lovers.
