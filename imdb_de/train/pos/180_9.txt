When Gundam0079 became a film trilogy, most of us are familiar, many of them pure action and less of everything else. This OVA is somehow the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but with emotional matters. I think the two main action sequences are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many Gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian movie. This movie did a fantastic job. This film is characterized by the fact that both sides of the war have good and bad people. This made the Zeons more human than the original films, in which they are portrayed as the second ascent of vicious Nazis. Most people who do not like anime I forced to watch this movie (lol) liked it. That's why I would recommend it to many people just for the anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan and have not seen this, you should not read this. You should already see it now.
