This was a wonderfully smart and entertaining movie that I will often see. The casting was great when it came to matching the boys to the older characters. There are those of us here who value really good actors and a smart story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for every type of production in which she plays. I always attach great importance to seeing Judi Dench in all her performances. She is an outstanding actress and it is a pleasure to see every change in her character come to life. I can only be thankful when I see such a great picture for most of the recent movies that lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film audience needs heroes, not deviant puppets who lack ingenuity and talent. How nice to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I want this movie to receive the awards it deserves. Thanks again for an incredible night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all those who have done such a good job.
