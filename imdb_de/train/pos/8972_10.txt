My discovery of the cinema by Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, whose pioneer was Jir√≠ Trnka. His Ruka is one of the most beautiful, technically most impressive animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then he makes himself a pot. But there comes the huge hand that crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of himself. He throws out his hand, but soon returns and locks him in a bird cage, where he is forced to form a stone hand. He goes to it, fainting with exhaustion, but finally he does the job. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful succession of metacinemen, the potter burns a candle to burn his visible puppet threads that amaze him to flee home. He locks himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is a pure animation, unlike modern films that want to be realistic (why?). For example, the hand is clearly a hand in hand. Everything else is clay. Strings are visible and part of the narrative, which makes them a precursor of the movie strings. The atmosphere is scary: This hand, which follows the little potter, has caused me more fear than many horror films together. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but it can not be manipulated for its simplicity. It's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that can win the hearts and minds of anyone who considers freedom as their natural right.
