If you are under 13 or over 13 and are quite intoxicated, you will enjoy D-War. If you're a serious fan of all kinds of mindless action movies, you'll enjoy D-War. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and that made me feel good. After the film, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking them for going to the theater with them. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. Acting and directing are terrible. The storyline is extremely simple. But with half the audience being kids, they screamed every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewer experience more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie your kids can take with them, but apart from the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10, mainly because the kids loved it so much.
