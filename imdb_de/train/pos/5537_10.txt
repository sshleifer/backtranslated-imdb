Maybe it was not all that good overall, but the second episode I'll say first was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and secrets. <br /> <br /> The mate's cockney slap, Chico Barnes, is amusing bells for those of us who have never been near London's Bow, but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of Francis' more interesting characters, and the show actually reduces some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, electronic pointers of the type used in the stories seem to be less functional to the user than the variety invented after World War II.
