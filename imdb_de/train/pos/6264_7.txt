The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary about 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals about the migration of summer to winter pasture. The basic value of this film today is a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how it lived during what we knew in the West as "roaring twenties". A drastic contrast was unimaginable. Wild river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under water actually die. To ensure that the audience at the time thought that the story had taken place, a signed certificate of authenticity was offered at the end. The version I saw had intriguing Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the movie. Despite all this, the movie is probably of greater value to the anthropologist than to the casual onlooker looking for a good evening entertainment. The crew had just enough stock to record the shots they had taken, and there are no fancy camera shots resulting from multiple repetitions. The Western Inter titles distract from the experience, but are actually part of the record as they show how Hollywood has tried to influence the lives of an indigenous people so that it is valued by the audience of the day. Off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "policeman's ball". The producers then made the documentary drama Chang (1927) and the fully commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is reused in People of the Wind (1976) and the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into - and then highly recommended for them.
