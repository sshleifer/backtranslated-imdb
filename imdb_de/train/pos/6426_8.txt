One of the best "Amitabh Comeback" movies I liked. This was the phase in which Govinda became strong with Dhawan. The songs were awesome and totally as we call it "Masti". An evergreen entertainer with people like the multi-faceted Anupam Kher. The story has many funny twists, as you know from David Dhawan. With a timely performance by Mrs. Madhuri "Nene" Dixit it was towards the end a total uproar. It was great to see Amit perform with so much power and humor after a long exile. Although some consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would watch it every day. I give him a simple 8 out of 10 points just because I'm pure Bollywood.
