Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed "The Baron" with a fantasy series about three superhuman spies that anticipated "The Six Million Dollar Man". It was a favorite of mine when I was a boy, and I still enjoy watching it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable chemistry on screen as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the delicious Alexandra Bastedo sulked through her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully rugged Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those of Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "The Interrogation" was favorable compared to "The Prisoner". I regret that there never was a second series. The concept had so much life in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron's affection? What if Tremayne had learned about the powers of champions? Did the champions have other abilities than the ones we saw? We never found out, unfortunately.
