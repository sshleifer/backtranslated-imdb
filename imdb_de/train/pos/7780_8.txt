Robert Stack has never really managed to lose an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" on Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life". Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil magnate. He spent his life in the shadow of the friend he grew up with, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is a drunken slut who falls in love with Mitch. Their story takes place in glorious colors under the capable direction of Douglas Sirk, who dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including "Imitation of Life," "All That Heaven Allows," "Magnificent Obsession," and many others. <Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles: Malone wins an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. There is an amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances wildly to loud music while her dad collapses on the stairs and dies. We believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas because she loves Mitch. Mitch does not want to have anything to do with her. He's so in love with Lucy that he wants to work in loyalty to Kyle in Iran to escape the temptation. I doubt he would be so impatient today, no matter how much he fell in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the Good, Kyle messes up his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife, who's in a nightmare, as her husband a year of sobriety begins to drink again. Sirk focuses on the more unstable supporting players. <br /> <br /> In Sirks hands, "Written on the Wind" is an effective movie, and the big scene towards the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and although he had many imitators, he was never equal.
