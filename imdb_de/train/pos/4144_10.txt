For a while I was trapped, watching independent and foreign films, and telling myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It's the truth. It's the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> The "badness" of this movie seems natural. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a secondhand dress. It takes an eccentric couple who is constantly trying to kill each other to go down the stairs. Jesus goes to a funk soundtrack. Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone lost his job when he was consulting a film project of a senior citizen. But it's the sincerity of how bad it is, what makes it so wonderful. One has the impression that the makers knew that it would be bad, but never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never be amazed, delivers Fatty. We recommend.
