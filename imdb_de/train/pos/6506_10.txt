Extremely brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made about the war. His tone stands in stark contrast to the often gung-ho posture of World War II, which the media show. Instead of choosing the horror of the war, she allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to go beyond the true images of war: corpses, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, suffering the innocent. Most of all, it really does bring home what humanity is capable of, if all normal rules of "courtesy" are lifted. Man has something Hobbesian in a true state of nature. He will return to a more vicious form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate after 60 years. Maybe there could be a follow-up series called "The Century at War", because the 20th century really was the century of horrors. I think it is an irony of tremendous magnitude that an event was necessary that caused the deaths of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and outstanding series like this one.
