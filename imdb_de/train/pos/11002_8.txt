Director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and inventive thriller that, while requiring some beliefs and concentration, is an extremely entertaining experience. Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a stay-home husband with a presumptuous wife, decides to spice up his earthly existence by taking a job as an industry spy at high-tech Digi Corp. received from Jack Thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches he sent back to his bosses via a nifty little electronic pen gizmo. In reality, the speeches are just a cover for far more abhorrent activities. Morgan is brainwashed with his conference attendees. The stunned water they drink puts them in a temporary coma, asking them to forget their past and take on their new identities on a permanent basis. Once they are fully convinced that they are somebody else, they are advised to apply for jobs with competing companies, where they can surrender without any suspicion of corporate espionage. <br /> <br /> But the plans of Digi Corp. Intervention of the dodgy intermediary Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who opens Morgan's eyes to what really happens. It gives Morgan an antidote to the mind that alters drugs so he can withstand brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he is not fully convinced that he is Jack Thursby, he will be "eliminated". Morgan joins and competes with rival companies Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives at his new workplace, he receives a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways bosses see this as an ideal opportunity to forward false data to Digi Corp, and Morgan becomes a double agent. From here things get increasingly complicated; The plot turns and turns, and poor old Morgan can not trust anyone. In an exciting finale, everything finally becomes clear (but only if you have followed the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Director Natali handles the proceedings confidently and certainly has the ability to produce a classic-looking movie for a movie on a relatively low budget. He succeeds in producing great performances from his talented cast; Especially Jeremy Northam is fantastic - his portrayal of the slightly nervous Morgan is perfectly played. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating film by a director willing to take risks, and I'm looking forward to his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
