One of the best documentary films of recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. His support came mainly from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, Chavez briefly staged a coup. At that time, the Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas and made a documentary about Chavez for British television. Her film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and electrifies the story that takes place on the spot outside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez sought to free Venezuela from the US free market policy. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was privately operated by executives who wanted to replace Chavez. <br /> <br /> 4. Although Venezuela is the world's fourth largest oil supplier, it is still flooded with poverty and its resources are literally being burnt by foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins with the presentation of the first years of Chavez as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity among the poor and its various strategies that have proved popular with working-class natives (education plans, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution to encourage children and adults to study and understand them. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. That made the oil companies understandably nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations promptly opposed the state television station. They questioned the motives, reason and sexual orientation of Chavez. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not have been successful. The film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to spread information, and that news can easily be fabricated. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "Restoring Democracy," the opposition silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, and the National Assembly and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Cash interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), organized a civic march to the presidential palace to carry out the coup. Snipers fired on Ch√°vez supporters, but the private media stations edited the footage so that it turned out that the refire was directed at the opposition march, which had indeed been safely diverted. <br /> <br /> 12. Police fired on Chavez supporters and blew the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied that he had resigned, but Chavez's Cabinet members disclosed the truth to the international community, which eventually brought the cable TV news back to Venezuela. 14. The people stood up and urged the return of their elected president, which only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - At just over an hour, this document is far too short. Nevertheless, it is a gripping piece of journalism and is about a form of "media warfare" that is rarely touched. Makes a great companion to "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
