I had the pleasure to see this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I'm very curious to see what she can do with a big picture. Kudos to the cast for their great performances (this little girl was gold) and everyone who composed the music. The distorted "Row Your Boat" blew me away. All in all a very creative movie ... I really hope he appears on video or DVD because I would buy him right now. If you have the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
