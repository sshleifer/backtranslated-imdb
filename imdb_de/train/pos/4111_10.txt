I first saw this movie as a teenager, about the age when kids start thinking about their identity. The scene of the man and the children he raises as his own touched me a lot. The oldest boy was mocked that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same birth father (which Kurosawa obviously makes when he has children who do not look alike). The man still persuades the boy that he is her father by the only definition that counts. The man is celebrated by all children as a father, except one who still prefers her brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also captivating for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not the greatest Kurosawa movie.
