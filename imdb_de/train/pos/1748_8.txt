I was so excited from the beginning to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dormitory in September. <br /> <br /> Each element came together so beautifully in this movie. It is not often that you see a movie with so many penis, gay and racial jokes that are so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast make every joke sensational. Carell stays sweet throughout the movie, and at the end of the movie you're rooting for him to be more successful in his relationship than to put him down. The cast is brutal, each of them has problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this film is the abundance of memorable scenes that we have given. This makes it easy for a movie to remember. This film is often referred to when the words "breast growth" and "condoms" are mentioned in conversations. <br /> <br /> When I look at him in the theater, I was surprised how many older people were there to look at him. I saw a group of four women in their mid-60s who came in. Despite an older audience, this film still filled the entire theater with laughter. I think the people who will like that are the fans of the office and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you would see in Family Guy. The film is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still cute and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of profanity or are offended easily. But when you're in the movie, just remember that this movie is in a good mood. The jokes are not "gay jokes", they're just jokes. And they are funny.
