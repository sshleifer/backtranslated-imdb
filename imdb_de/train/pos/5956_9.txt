Yes, this is a movie with an extremely low budget. Acting is not an award-winning material, and sometimes the action is slow because the filmmakers shoot longer sequences rather than a million moments, which are then turned into a movie. This film makes up for it with an excellent script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it, and turns it into a complete storyline. Apart from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics information, legal and legal enforcement, martial arts actions, philosophical trainings, and good metal music. Kudos to Dylan O'Leary, the director / writer / lead actor. It is inexplicable to me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and made them so good. To appreciate this movie, you have to be familiar with all sorts of topics to see that the author has done a lot of research and knows about all these things. There are also some great camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen yet, but it's a tribute to the underwater zombie attack in Fulci's Zombi. The casting is good, in that the sexy woman is actually sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that there should be more nudity for a low budget horror movie. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to future projects from Mr. O'Leary.
