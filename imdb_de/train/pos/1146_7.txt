This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. Saying something else would ruin the movie. There are several representations and signatures in the film. This film was cast with the hottest stars of the present. They all deliver the excellence. This movie is a favorite of mine from 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of the time of day soap opera or the prime time soap opera.
