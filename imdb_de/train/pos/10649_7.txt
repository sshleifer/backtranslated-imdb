What can I say about that? It's another Hollywood horror movie with a very high budget ($ 80 million). Not scary, it just gives us some thrills and a really spooky sequence with a skeleton in the fireplace special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However, I do not like the end because it was so abundant. Check this out and make your own opinion about it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
