I have looked at it a lot and plan to buy the complete feature. I love Jason Steele's comedy. It is very different and unique and a lot of fun. I love indie movies and this one is just great. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short film is about a spatula called Spatula. The sequence of events is a bit confused, which makes the movie very interesting. First you see Edward fighting with the spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. This is a stupid movie, but of course it's still great. I urge you to watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It is very funny. The humor may not suit every taste, but still be careful. It only takes 16 minutes and it's free. WATCH SPATULA WATNESS!
