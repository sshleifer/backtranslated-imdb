I checked this as an impulse when looking through the film business and could not have been pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we loved it. It's not the typical "chick movie" with a juicy love story and rips all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the turn at the end. It is an end to which the overall effect of the film, though unexpected and tragic, will not be affected. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this movie, her debut, and that's definitely worth a look! I did not recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well. "The Man in the Moon" is a credible story about a young teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can definitely refer to anything - from Witherspoon's words, their subtle looks and their not-so-subtle emotions (angry as a typical teenage woman). While she plays a confused character, she does not seem stupid and immature, which has been much appreciated in the face of many movies today.
