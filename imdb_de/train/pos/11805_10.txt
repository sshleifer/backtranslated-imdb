Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's list was excellent. A great watch for children and adults of all sexes. Big noses can be seen as an allusion to phallic symbols, just like H.R. Puff N Stuff had pointed out marijuana smoking. Your kids will love this movie. I really enjoyed it as a kid. My father showed me this movie as a child. He enjoyed it too, pointing out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although I had no idea what it was then. The movie is comedy and adventure. The plot is crazy and happy. Me and you will enjoy this together.
