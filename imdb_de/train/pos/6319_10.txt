Having had the opportunity to see a few films in the Slavic Village on Broadway, I could not wait to see the final copy. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie in the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I did not laugh At a comedy for a long time! It's a great slapstick. The Russo brothers did a good job. The entire cast plays their best comedic acting ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great because he's the crippled Safe Breaker in this movie. Most impressed me William H. Macy as rogue "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto", they hold you in "stitches". I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
