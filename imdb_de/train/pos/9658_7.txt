"Come Undone" seems to evoke many opinions among the participants of this forum. Granted, it's a movie that, as most viewers expect, promises a take on gay life and somehow gets caught up in this promise in an introspective look at the soul of a young man. The film has a chance to stay with us, even when it's over. It's a character study of how a young man gets involved in a love affair with someone so different from him that leaves Mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things do not live up to the expectations he hoped for would. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the director of the film, has told his story Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be disoriented by the different times in the movie, but there are hints that are not obvious, as you can see in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that might help some people watch the movie. This is a story about the doomed love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the final collapse of her life. <br /> <br /> At first, Cedric, the handsome young native, pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him Mathieu is also interesting to Cedric. We realize how different the two young men are, because Cedric tells Mathieu's family how he does not think he is at school. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to become an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric brought him. We watch as Mathieu reads from the guidebook and asks Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu arrives to his mother, she tells him wisely how important it is to continue his career. It also shows what future both would have in common, which turns out to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson the hard way. He goes with Cedric to an insecure life and tries to take his own life. We watch him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who has treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The end may be confusing for most viewers, but there's a moment in the movie where Mathieu works in a bar. There we see him washing glasses and Pierre, the young man, who visits the bar, looks attentively. That's why it's hard to imagine Mathieu looking for Pierre in his house. However, we have seen how Mathieu obviously cares about Pierre. The last scene on the beach, as Pierre and Mathieu are walking in the sand, has a hopeful sign that things between them will be better when they see a boy who seems to be lost, but then realize that the father is in the Nearby is. <Br /> <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu has suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressive mother and the loss of Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who appeared in other major French films, is as good as the flat Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will share the opinions, the film deserves a consideration due to its complexity and interest. Sebastien Lifshitz relives the story.
