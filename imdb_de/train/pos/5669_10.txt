In her first inadequate role, Esther Williams plays a teacher who is the victim of sexual assault. It performs well and proves that it can be very effective out of the pool. As the detective who is supposed to solve the case, George Nader may be his best performer. And he is so pretty that it hurts! John Saxon is under suspicion, and although he receives an impressive reckoning in the credits, Edward Andrews, as his overprotective father, is the standout. <br /> <br /> Dipped in gorgeous technicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible to Hokum and sometimes compelling drama.
