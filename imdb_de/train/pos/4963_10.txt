Leave Braik to show a good show. After all, he and Zorak live their own lives outside Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love both shows very much. They are completely what Adult Swim started. Brak made it big with an album that came out in 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was really popular with a lot of people who love Adult Swims Shows. I have to say that among all non-plot adult swim shows, there is no plot at all. That's why I like it so much, it's just a classic in the history of Adult Swim. I think that's just a great show if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons that hated it and tons that loved it.
