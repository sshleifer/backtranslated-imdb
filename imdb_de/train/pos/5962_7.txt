Over the years, I've seen a whole slew of '80s rock horror horrors, from garbage like' Terror on Tour 'to ridiculously fun gems like' Slumber Party Massacre 2 '. Somehow, time and time again, I managed to suspend this offer, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and most received one. Well, I've finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly horrible (but almost always lovable!) Subgenre. The plot (which was pretty much raised in the movie "Black Roses") is about a battered fool named Eddie, who was mocked by everyone in his high school for his musical taste. He loves 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields). After Sammi is killed, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gives him the final recording of Sammi. As soon as Eddie plays the disc backwards, he realizes that he is a bit more difficult, and bad things happen to those who mock him. Is Sammi's music obsessed? "Trick or Treat" is well done and a total scream. The special effects are fantastic, though they have the typical laser beams of the 80s. I grew up in the 80s, and although I was not a Heavy Metal fan, I remember the city legend that they played a record backwards and listened to the sounds of Satan worship. Haha! I can also remember my older siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan. It is very amusing to see both of them making cameos as harmless radio DJs and anti-rock priests. If I had only seen this movie as a kid! While the movie in the 80s seems to be amusing between alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really understands why Sammi Curr has returned from the dead, causing havoc and killing anyone who gets in his way. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you can overlook it, it's a lot of fun.
