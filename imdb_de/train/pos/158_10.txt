I have seen this movie more than once and there is always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot. But then - that's part of Petzold's game: he plays with the genre rules. <br /> <br /> It's very beautiful how the most unlikely story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet again. In another, even more unlikely, story, the girls are mirroring them for one Compensate for casting. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, more about potential, about things that may or may not have happened in the past than actual events. It is a kind of reverie - so fitting that there are many motifs that Freud might find interesting for his dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger" constellations. <br /> <br /> I also think that "ghosts" could be interesting compared to the eerie modern Asian cinema: Petzold's everyday city architecture feels unobtrusively strangely haunted. This movie is not about the obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or the story of an orphaned mother looking for her lost daughter in Europe, she does not say much about the nature of "ghosts".
