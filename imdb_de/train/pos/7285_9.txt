This movie scared me when I was a kid. It's not a Citizen Kane, but it has its moments. The scene with the arms is good. The plot is good even if the characters are not - which could have something to do with acting. Put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get. This was one of those filming, editing (which was little) and distribution in a few months. This is a classic low budget sci-fi that only deserves it. I rated it with 9 other films of this genre and age.
