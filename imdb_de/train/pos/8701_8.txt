For anyone expecting a traditional superhero movie, this might be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more of a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit of a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character is, it always goes awry. Society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. On the run, he meets a pretty girl and falls in love, making things even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot is really dramatic, but the movie lacks dynamism. It reminds me a little of the story in the last films of Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. But when there's an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that before you know what's going on, it's all over. But the director does not want to impress us with eye-catching and eye-catching action. More important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very close, which makes it harder to focus on the movie. You really have to be very patient to look at it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? This question is really hard to answer. I do not think this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I keep thinking of this movie and feel like watching it again. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is really dense but not stifled because Sasha and Katya have hope all the time. After all, it's young people who have to live their entire lives. No matter how hard it gets, there is always a slightly joyous melody when they are together.
