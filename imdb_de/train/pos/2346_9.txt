Very sweet pilot. The show stinks of Tim Burton's better films ... Edward Sissorhand, Big Fish, Charlie, and The Chocolate Factory. The cinematography, the narrative, the music, the outer scenes all scream at Tim Burton. There has to be a connection or a strong influence, I just did not research enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forums, Anna Friel plays a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and adorable and you are easily tied to her. It's more of a distraction that I keep thinking, "Why did not they get Zooey Deschanel?" <br/> <br /> Lee Pace also does a great job. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and just looked. Wonder cases !!! Great, short-lived 2004 series. If you like Pushing Daisies, you MUST rent Wonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> Loved seeing Swoosie Kurtz (World after Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two undervalued character actresses, who always bring it back.
