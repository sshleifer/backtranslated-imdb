Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is the sequel to Bill and Ted's outstanding adventure. Their deceitful henchman follows almost immediately after the first movie and is as good as a job, if not better, to entertain the viewer. The plot is a nasty person from the future trying to kill Bill. Ted uses evil robots that look just like Bill and Ted. Once the robots have killed Bill and Ted, they must compete with the Grim Reaper (Death) and normalize their lives. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is first-rate, and even thought it was a bit weird. Sometimes it's a great movie, especially in Bill and Ted's conversations. The wannabe rockers have certainly made another great movie. Get the next time you're at Blockbuster!
