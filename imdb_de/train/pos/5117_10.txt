Few films have influenced American culture as much as Urban Cowboy. Thank God it was only temporary. But UC is in a class of its own, like switching channels at three in the morning. You just can not take your eyes off my eyes ... my first three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but that's beside the fact. I remember that Urban Cowboy was in the movie theaters and overnight, Honkytonk's were opened on every corner, men wore cowboy hats with their penny idlers, and if you did not know how to take two steps, you were considered an idiot! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who would have thought that? He is actually credible. The soundtrack is great. Too bad that Charlene Tilton, who became famous from Dallas, ruined the career of Johnny Lee because this guy was just great. The show stealer is Scott Glenn as the greasy ex-con redneck cowboy. And I have nothing against greasy ex-con cowboys who are one, but I've always envied what I think is the best power line ever ... "Pack-at S * # t!" Clint "make my day". And seeing him beat Sissy around is what I see closest to my Julia Roberts fantasy. As I said, beautiful. 9.10
