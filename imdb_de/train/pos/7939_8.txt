How nice to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who, on a whim in Las Vegas, marry and then not only have to pass the news on to their children, but must then try to blend their respective households (each has two boys and two girls) to a coherent family unit. What happens when the group of four teenagers, two teenagers and two younger children first asks if Carrie and Jim can really be happy? The struggles between the children (and a little love affair between two of them) raise the question of whether they will ever get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, which is a totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a feel-good film for all ages.
