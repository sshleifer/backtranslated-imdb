This is a long-lost horror gem with Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It's sometimes difficult to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is scary and cheesy at the same time. It appears that three young journalists (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to discuss a festival when there is a mix-up between their hotel room and Earnest Keller's house (Lassick). and his foreign wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind and feels sick while the other two film her story. She is soon murdered in the house, VERY SKILLED by an unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is beheaded by the fan's closing cover as she bumps into her while being dragged through the basement). Soon, Karen returns and is brutally murdered, with her face rammed through the vent. Jennifer struggles with her (former?) Lover in a rather boring subplot, and when she returns home, her hosts (whom we've discovered by now, brother and sister and that everything in the basement is their son) are planning to Plan to try to murder her too. Virgina disapproves of Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer, but she has the knack of going to the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost funny, as Junior (portrayed by Stephen Furst hysterically) is a deformed, mentally defective manchild whose actions and movements cause a few giggles, though it is supposed to be sinister. Here the speed of the film increases and the end is well done. The actors are doing a great job with the material, especially with Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although it is not the worst film ever made, it is very entertaining!
