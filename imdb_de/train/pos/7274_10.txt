No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances so far. Mencia is known for making fun of race problems. But he does more than that in this stand-up performance that took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material not only makes people laugh, but also reflects on what is really wrong in today's society. In this hour-long performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration women really mean when they have equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ and an argument he has had with a woman regarding whether he Jesus is affected or not, and how society should treat these people is physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often gets him in trouble with his critics. For example, he goes a bit far (and he admits it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he most likely does in heaven. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all his performances is that we all have one voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel, and not to be afraid to offend them. He reminds us that we have a right to freedom of expression and that we must use that right as an American. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I definitely recommend Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central.
