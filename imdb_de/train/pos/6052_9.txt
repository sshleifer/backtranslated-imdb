We recommend !! <br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone. Try it, it's good to see an Independent British Movie instead of prevailing over the big established studios !! Definitely worth a supplement to any movie collection. There are scenes in this movie that I'm sure many people can relate to. They will laugh at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb version of Jimmy Cliff's Vietnam and the Tower of London versus Freebird. <br /> <br /> Carry on ............ You will not be disappointed.
