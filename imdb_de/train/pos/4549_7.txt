"My Left Foot" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist crippled by cerebral palsy, who learned to paint with her left foot, the only link in his body over which he had control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar for Best Actor for this film, which I'm not entirely convinced he deserved, but is still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this movie is that sometimes it's a bit too real. If Brown is desperate to help someone and do everything with his left foot, watching the movie can be difficult. This gives him an often depressing feeling that can temporarily turn off some viewers. However, if you look beyond, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have disabilities and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still have problems with us are inspired by this film, because if anything is more difficult than us to overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, sometimes pleasant, but hard to see. Can not be for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
