Let's be honest: The last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons on every show I've ever enjoyed (mostly I've never found droughts that lasted a full season). But judging this show after the last season will of course make it look inferior. This is a totally unfair assessment - because "That '70s Show" was a brilliant and funny sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there were not as different as we are here today. <br /> <br /> All right ... Season 8 ignored. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace plays Eric Forman, a horny geek of a teenager with an eternal love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist next door. With their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) perform fantastically in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student as mentally promiscuous as he gets. Which country is he from? Try to find out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp as Kitty is both scary and sweet, just like Mrs. Brady Marie meets Barone, while Smith's Red is mainly there to scare the Pogees of all. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well as Donna's parents, the chauvinist but likable Bob and the air-headed Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a Stoner, who acts for Hyde as a father figure. Apart from the anachronistic mistakes that often occur and the exaggerated lessons that sometimes come (and) "The 70s" is a terrific show with great lyrics, aptitude, and a sense of emotion that pulses in every episode. They are all alright.
