When I saw commercials, I thought, "NO WHAT'S NICK AT NITE DONE!" because it took "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love the fresh prince. But George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how not stereotypical Benny is. Carmen is a pretty good character, it's really funny to see how stupid and cocky she can sometimes be. I feel bad for the guy who plays Max, he looks a lot younger than he actually is! but max is a funny character and has done well. and yes, angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! But he can be really good too. funny show! It should definitely be more than home improvement.
