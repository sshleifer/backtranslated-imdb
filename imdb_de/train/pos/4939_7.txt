This movie is not great, but it is good and enjoyable. It feels like an indie movie from a script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there's the little irony of the actor researching in a supermarket to find a movie he's not committed to yet. I mean, he did the movie in the end and we look at him :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but still refreshing. This is a movie that inspires the viewer to look at their own lives and to choose the direction in which to go. A little too much emphasis on the look if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A nice little movie that was filmed in two weeks, with essentially two actors and a few extras that are controlled by dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
