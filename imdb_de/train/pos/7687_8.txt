Like The Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms never aired in the UK, let alone its appearance in the 1970s, a decade I was not born of. <br /> <br But like most fans of the show, I saw a few episodes on You Tube - and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is run by James and Florida - two parents who are trying to find an ending and who, despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own life goals, to embrace them fulfill their opportunities. James was the stern but loving father who dared not hesitate to discipline J. J., Michael and Thelma - should they cross the line. Florida, on the other hand, was a fair, kind and considerate mother and loving woman, although she was similar in many ways to James in terms of her attitude to parenting and family values ​​from an African-American perspective. <br /> The children were as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a silly personality and a crazy sense of humor who often wore multi-colored outfits and whose 'DY-NO-MITE' sentence is as contagious and familiar as Arnold Jackson's 'Whatchoo Talking' on Willis? by Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the smart guy who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Their verbal taunts with JJ were mostly hilarious, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was played extremely well by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. Over the seasons, there have been a few cameo appearances, most notably Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen, and a young Gary Coleman as himself! I prefer the Good Times to the Cosby Show, which was an 80's show, because a) I preferred the Evans family to the Huxtables, both in characterizing a) and b) in my view serious and difficult social problems. in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary that should emphasize the life of the African-American working class in America in the 1970s. The Cosby Show tried to serve the mainstream audience in a kind of "candy coat," as the Huxtables were portrayed as Blacks, which easily assimilated into a high-end American culture that we associated with Whites, while Good Times, on the other hand, did a lot more was 'edgier', and it was not afraid to realistically address issues such as drug and child abuse. In fact, I've found out that The Cosby Show can be fun sometimes, but there was a lack of 'Sassiness' that Good Times has and from which it has become more trendy and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show abated During the last seasons, as he continued to follow John Amos's character, James died in an unusual accident (in fact, it was known at the time that John had finally left the Good Times And so the death of his character was written as he is in the show). Without John, the show has suffered and unfortunately she has lost much of her charm. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Good Times was the right choice for a sitcom. If only they had shown that in Britain in the '80s. As it is, as JJ would say, "DY-NO-MITE !!" <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
