This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers. What other world had America been compared to our psychotic twenty-first century? If you watch this movie, you can get a feel for what a 1972 America was like. I found out that the clothes and the car styles reminded me of a much better country than we have now. Just think ... at that time there were only 4 or 5 TV channels to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, bird flu, Freeway Snipers, etc. The Vietnam War was over. It will be seven years before Star Wars comes out. The computer and the internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out, the producers had to market the film themselves like no other movie company wanted. So it began to see small Protestant churches across the country shown on film projectors (these were the days before VCRS). The pastor of a church interested in showing his church a thief in the night would get a copy of the film. He then arranged an evening to show him in the assembly area of ​​the church or in the dining room. Members of the community would invite "unsaved" friends and family members, and this would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the film's limited production values ​​and just look at it for its nostalgic value, I think the movie will be more fun for you. Of course, I speak as a Geneva. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now.
