I just want to say that no matter how low the budget is, the movie has to be shown around the world. We do not read so much anymore, instead people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD made me want to read the whole series and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. Please do not change any of the characters, it will destroy the effect. Because I love the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. I would like to see the message and see the message that these books and now movies are showing here. We can not get enough of that anymore. IMPRESSIVE WORK !!!
