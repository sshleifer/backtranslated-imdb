While Urban Cowboy did not get along with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo, there was a close look into that day and age, in urban Texas. I also think that in order to really criticize this film, one has to live in the time and relative place where it was made. There was good music, fun times and, yes, some "rough falls" in the Honky Tonk Roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, like "two ships passing by at night," was well thought out. When Pam had torn up the note Sissy had written to Bud, the tragedy of many true romance novels was reflected. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and the crew did a great job. I found the script well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
