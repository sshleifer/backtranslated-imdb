Although it is recognized as the best movie treatment of the difficulties when a house is built (or bought) in the country to your specifications, it is not the first or the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the main characters in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. About fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead role in THE MONEY PIT. The first one referred to the move to an 18th century country house where he needs work. The latter was about building your dream home - in the late eighties. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising specialist (he earns $ 15,000 a year in 1948, which today is about $ 90,000) and lives in a luxury apartment - which he leased in New York City then! - He feels they should look for something better. He and Muriel drive into the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin, which can both set up as a dream house, they want. <br /> <br /> And both fall into the financial wormhole buying land and construction can cause. For one, they are so excited about the idea of ​​building a house like this, they ignore the warning after being warned by their clever, cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas in a sardonic role). For example, Jim lands at a dealer in Connecticut (Ian Wolfe quietly sucks his chops) and checks before checking the proper cost of the land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he has paid five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it's worth. There are water supply issues that both Blandings never think about, such as: Hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis-Zis water softening machine. They find that the designs they have in mind and worked out with their architect (Reginald Denny) can not be dropped cheaply. Muriel decided to make Muriel's decision to build a small building that nobody planned. <br /> <br /> The escalating cost of the project is one thing Jim regrets. He was appointed to handle the "Wham" account ("spam" had become a popular result of World War II as the public used it as a meat substitute because of his success in the armed forces). Jim can not handle this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled in front of him). He comes with the following "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little piglet went to the market, <br /> <br /> He was pink and as pretty as ham. <Br /> <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> When they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up as a "wham"! <br /> <br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads this! Jim is also increasingly suspicious of Bill and Muriel's attention, though (in this case) Bill is without guilt. But he's always around (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is a clear mind and that he keeps Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have mishaps, preferably when they are trapped in a room of the half-built house, just as the men have left the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to knock the door down with an emergency ram. He breaks a window open and the door opens on its own. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, with all the actors seemingly enjoying themselves. It's a movie that does not age at all, despite changing price levels and salary levels. After all, most Americans dream of owning their own home, and always have it. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, a paint company used a lovely scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint shop the Parnell company has to do in various rooms. She carefully shows the distinct reds, blues, etc. she wants - even when she lends a polite Parnell a single thread for the right blues. The commercials indicated that the paint manufacturer had a wide choice of colors to choose from. In the commercial launch, they proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings." However, you can imagine the no-nonsense Parnell handling the situation after Loy leaves him with his color crew.
