The movie is fine, it has moments, the music scenes are the best of everything! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (suitable for starters as it's a great party song and a very fast tempo), Take Me With U (a fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a happy song) Ballad, probably the R & B closest album on this entire album), Computer Blue (a somewhat furious anthem in the direction of Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs of all time, he only vaguely discovers Appolonia Funny), When Doves Cry (the highlight of this masterpiece), I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm A Star and of course Purple Rain (a true classic, a very fitting graduation for this classic album) The Movie and the Album Both are very good. I highly recommend her!
