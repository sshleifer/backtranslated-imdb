This is a movie that the mainstream market is unlikely to ever access, as it's not easy to see for the viewer. The story about troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but it has its own unique advantage and I found that entertaining. There are moments of brilliance given the fact that the film was filmed on such a small budget, for example, when Spike inhaled the aerosol. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton, and frankly, I spent most of the movie trying to find the way to find out. And I do not like the fact that most of the movie is spent with the two friends and not really much action. It's a small movie that's complex to look at, and that makes it attractive.
