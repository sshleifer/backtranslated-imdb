A gratifying unpretentious show of Romeo and Juliet. If you have no expectations but to have a good time, you will enjoy them. A talented group of comic actors lets go and has a revolt in this carefree vehicle of the performers. Bad ratings were due to a snobbery over the treatment of Shakespeare. Some people believe that all movies have to be "important" --- If you share these views, do not bother. In the credits it says "Angelina Jolie" to introduce, which is not nearly true, but she is amazingly beautiful as a Julia figure, and as always, her acting is wonderful - and given her age even her dialect is pretty good. To recreate this classic story of the feuds of Italian families in New York's gastronomy is a lot of fun. See it in the right mood and you will laugh out loud.
