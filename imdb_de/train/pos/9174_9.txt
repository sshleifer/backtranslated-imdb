There were many screen and television productions by Jane Eyre, each of which had something to recommend, but I suspect that this is the one that people will discover and fall in love with in decades. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others). Timothy Dalton is in his element as a Rochester and rarely misses the target. His performance is astonishingly quick and multi-colored, while never deviating too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarkes Jane is more cerebral than she is beyond the world, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who conveniently sticks out over her!). The nuances of their performance come into their own in a second look (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical mistakes and some moments when the production values ​​could have been better. although this was pretty much a top production, measured by the then standards of the BBC. But it's the performances that are the real pleasure. Do not miss these!
