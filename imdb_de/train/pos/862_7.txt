Carla is a secretary who is basically deaf without her hearing aids. If she's overworked at work, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul is just out of jail and his past is not quite behind him. To say much more about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she can not - a kind of "sense of hearing" (like viewpoint). The first scenes that set this up, as well as the early character development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the later twists and turns, some of which were hard to follow and / or added to the credibility. There are also unpleasant acts of violence. Back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing, but maybe not in search. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 28.04.2002.
