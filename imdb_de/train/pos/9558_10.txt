I consider myself quite big in the anime scene, with very few shows I will just NOT GROW. <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend this show to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pretty much the most original original series so far, it has pretty much everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that is NOT allowed, a very blatant comedy and a very well-composed speaking role (both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly funny aspect, it would just be another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I've noticed, a "loving or hate", very few people I've seen. There's going to be a dislike to this series. <br /> <br /> Original to the core, with everything you could ask for an afternoon, bet the house on this series. I am ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
