This was a very good movie and it is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time it was published. There are some movies that are not getting older, but this is clearly outdated. However, I've seen this movie as a boy, and for more than twenty years, both the pictures and the story were memorable for me and most of my friends until we saw them on DVD again. Actually, I remember this movie as the subject of various chat and meeting sessions where old guys talked about things we have in common. So there was a bit of disappointment and even sadness when we finally got the DVD. First, there was a theory about how naive our generation was. Second, I think there is something more. I would appreciate that this movie has something that should be of interest to all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the decaying horror genre. This is the mutilation, the idea that gives the film coherence; The fact that a human being is mutilated creates a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick the sensation was when the monster tore out Kurt's arm. And at the end; When the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Also noteworthy is the morbid atmosphere that spreads through all the scenes without the intensity decreasing, regardless of whether the action takes place in a secret laboratory, in a lonely street where the man in the car is looking for a female body Dressing room for Striper. and so on. Maybe the reasons why it's not a good movie anymore are just technical things. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man who saved his fianc√©'s head, a more detailed work made for another and modern director of the second unit might be interesting. The same goes for all action scenes, including Kurt's arm. Also, something could be done with the makeup of the monster. Some remakes were good; I think in this case would be worth a try. Nevertheless, the black and white tones should be preserved.
