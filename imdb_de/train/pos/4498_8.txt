Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, that's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well done by everyone. Even some laughing moments mingled with some fairly serious observations about fidelity, old-age stress and aging of parents / Alzheimer's. <br /> <br /> Whimsical guitar music added the story. <br /> While I was a fan of Ms. Annis since 'Lillie' ('70s) and Mr. Kitchen's since' The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I've recently discovered Mr. Green ("Me and Ms. Jones", "Touching Evil", etc.), which makes me ask the question - why until recently did not I see "Reckless"? !! Admittedly, it's more of a "chick movie" than a man sees through, it's perfect for a lazy afternoon on a rainy afternoon.
