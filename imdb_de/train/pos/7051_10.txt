Let me first say that "War, Inc" is not for everyone. However, it is very pleasant (and makes you think - "Oh, crap"). The comedy with which the film is associated is not at all obvious - it's pretty subtle (Tamerlane tanks, cleaning service, etc.) and only changes one with the twists in the plot, but I do not compare that to "Big Point Blank." "because it is different. John Cusack - I would not say that he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was unbelievable in terms of line and comic timing - even though she was barely in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley) Marisa Tomei plays a compelling reporter and manages to do that , Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job (though her accent is a bit unreal). , It does not have a specific plot and it is sometimes stupid, but it has a subtle message. I would say it's worth a watch.
