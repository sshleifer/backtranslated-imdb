Finally, a thriller that omits the chases, explosions and other eye-catching effects. The film combines a simple plot (murder of a French president) with a magnificent background. It takes a look behind the behavior of people at the authorities and explains why we would obey almost every command (even murder) that would be given to us. <br /> <br /> It also shows us how secret services can manipulate history and how hard they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood End" that can be easily predicted.
