This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen, and in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really works in all this! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely makes it one of my top 5 and should be fun for any movie lover. While the action sequences have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even the flying, the way they are shot differs greatly from the style of Hero, and flying always looks good and usually makes sense (spirits can fly) ) Watch this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
