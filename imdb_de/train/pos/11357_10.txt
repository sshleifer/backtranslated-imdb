"Citizen X" is the great story told about hunting for one of history's worst serial killers. What makes this story even more fascinating is where and when it happened. The Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Mild Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (magnificently played by Stephen Rea) is a newly promoted forensic investigator of the militia in the Rostov region. He discovers unexplained past and present murders, apparently from the same person. The murders are unclear because nobody has bothered to properly investigate the evidence. He has to find and stop the murderer. His only tools are his commitment, ability and honesty. Its obstacles are corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system, which deters the search for the truth. His naivete would have failed if his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland), had not been there. Fetisov is a politically clever cynic who understands the game and can handle the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even if the official party is: "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. The places and sets are perfect replicas of today's Soviet life. The rating of Randy Edelman is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon that has both intensity and intensity. This was a cable-built movie by HBO Films and they have become a great source for movies that would never be done otherwise.
