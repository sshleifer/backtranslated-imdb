Thankfully, this was not based on a true story, because what a story it is. Populated by despicable characters whose corruption knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a hypnotizing, mind-boggling outing to perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes even with or because of the fiercely tragic undercurrent of all human dysfunction) it did not come with such a great overwhelming conviction of his stars. The excellent screenplay by Kelly Masterson and the outstanding directing by none other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt either. The main dysfunction here is of a familial nature, with the two largely spanked brothers (brilliant portraits of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob the jewelry store of their own parents, an attempt that goes pathetically wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is told with time shifts (which are noted on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the robbery," so no one should be confused); Some people said that they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, which increased the pervasiveness of the whole thing, as the two brothers barely play full decks - between them, you could not play decent poker hands for your life to rescue. Throw in those cheesy extra tidbits: One of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also awarded), who has an affair with the other brother, and a formidable rivalry between siblings and the said fact drug addicted brother hates his Father (a terrible achievement of Albert Finney) who apparently caused him severe pain in the past, and you have a Shakespearean / Greek tragedy on your hands. Continue with caution.
