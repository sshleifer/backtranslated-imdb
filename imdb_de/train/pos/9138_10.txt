I own this movie and have watched it several times over the years since its release. Prince does not impress us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I think that's what he's shown here, he's simply the best one to tell this story through influence. Most of this film is uncomplicated and youthful, but that's the fault of the directors / writers. Still, it's a great movie with even better music. The principles and moral beliefs in Purple Rain are pretty strong. If more films were based on the basics, we would be taught as children, we would have a better environment, since art reflects the life that reflects the art.
