This is a roaring western, and I have watched it many times and it entertains at every level. However, it is important that you look for the true facts about legends like Hickcock, Cody, and Calamity Jane who look elsewhere when John Ford calls it the West Legend becomes legend. The story is moving at a rapid pace, and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very observant stars making this film. The sharp-eyed eyes below you could only see Gabby Hayes as something Indian Scout, there's also a very young Anthony Quinn making his debut as a Cayenne warrior. He actually married one of Demille's daughters in real life. When the credits are final, he merges with the American West with American history. So please take some time to see this classic western.
