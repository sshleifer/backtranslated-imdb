The brutal, emotionless Michael Myers suffocates his sister at the age of six on the Halloween night of 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes a psychiatric institution and introduces a new reign of terror in his hometown Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being persecuted the whole time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how evil this young man is. <br /> <br /> He starts off with a bang and sets up a really exciting and atmospheric chiller that's really superior to the many Slasher imagery it has helped to inspire. Compared to the nasty blood baths that were many of these subsequent films, that's subtle. subtle and scary. It retains the ability to make me jump after repeated considerations. How many movies are there really that can be scary even if you've seen them before? Not so many. <br /> <br /> Pleasence is great in the probably definitive role of his career. Jamie Lee Curtis became a loyal screaming queen in her feature film debut after starring in "Halloween" and some subsequent Slasher images, and she's an intended victim worthy of rooting Author / director John Carpenter knows what works well in this movie, and uses shadows and dark skies superbly. Note that most of the movie is set after dark. With this image, he and his former colleague Debra Hill created a franchise that has produced seven sequels, many imitators and an upcoming "re-imagining". <br /> <br /> It's quite quotable - who could ever call Dr. Loomis's (Pleasence) speech describing Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a trusted repertoire player in several of Carpenter's earlier works)? This is my favorite movie by John Carpenter of all time. <br /> <br /> It's not completely infallible - after all, there are script holes - but overall, it makes a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
