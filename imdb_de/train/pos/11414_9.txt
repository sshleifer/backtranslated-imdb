A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is excellent as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is funny as a "coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" outstanding. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" shows a good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first lead extremely well. This movie is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The workmanship is first class.
