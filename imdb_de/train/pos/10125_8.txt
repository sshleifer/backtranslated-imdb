This movie is the first of the Miikes Triad Society trilogy, and the trilogy starts off with a great start. The films in the trilogy are only thematically related, and these themes are actually evident in all of his films, if you look closely. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his little brother from engaging with a rather extreme group of outsiders who have to fight their way to the head of the Tokyo Yakuza. The little brother is a lawyer, and the Triad gang needs more and more in the course of the film. The film is set in a very harsh environment and is therefore quite violent and hard. Miike has made it worse, but since this is a serious movie, it hits you very hard. As usual, there is a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a driving force and a grudge. If you've just seen Miike's far-flung movies (Ichi, The Murderer, Fudoh, etc.), take a look, as this is a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style in these movies and his more serious side as in the movies to see other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this one you'll NEVER forget (look at them and find out which ones for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
