After some negative reviews that I heard in this movie, I was not sure if I would try, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and thought I was going to buy a budget like the movie, saw that and pretended and I'm glad I liked it. Directed by The Star of films like Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity (Brian Cox), I had to play with it, even if it was junk, but that was not at all, I found the humor rather weird, especially Alfred Molina, who Star of Spider-Man 2, the character Doc Ock. He was the most beautiful part of the movie. Of course, like so many people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name and that made me get it! and not his part is not big at all, he is very short at the end of the movie, it's not a big part that makes me believe that people hate the movie. I suggest you try it. Some parts are bad for the pit that needed polishing, action and a bit more action. But it is visible.
