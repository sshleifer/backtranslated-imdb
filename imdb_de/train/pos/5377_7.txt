"The College Girl Murders" is my first acquaintance with the paperwork of Edgar Wallace. and generally my first real acquaintance with "thriller" movies in general? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. The stuff is really entertaining, although I would never have expected it? stupid! The film has an exciting and beautifully intricate storyline, with a healthy dose of humor, extravagant twists, and pretty ingenious kills. There is a James Bond type of the evil mastermind? who is always in the shadows and is recruiting prisoners in front of a large monitor to kill certain girls at a certain college with a new poison. There is also a vicious monk with a whip dressed like a communist KKK member who gets rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and the like, and a crazy police commissioner who continues to solve the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had known earlier that these crime movies are so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought a whole collection of them. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end, and the overload of weird gimmicks on Scotland Yard's Inspector Higgins account is sometimes a little slippery, but I do not care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60s soundtrack stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant of the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
