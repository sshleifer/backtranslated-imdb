This film does not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is all beautiful and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem the right thing at the time, but in retrospect do not look as good as they used to. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, yes, it does involve religion, but in fact it's a family, and that family's ability to stay together, no matter what gets thrown at them. This film is also based on true events, which does not mean that this story is true scene by scene, but if you were to look at news articles from that time, you might see that none of the churches handled the incident in Berlin a way for the family was helpful. Both churches are in debt here, the Catholic Church, for having enforced such rules for the family and not responding to the associated violence, and the Protestant Church, which has told Mother to serve her husband and his family Priests obey and do not fight. In this case, both let this family down. I believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle both in the church and in the family. It is in no way a form of the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows how an incident can change the train of thought of this religion and how a person can achieve much more than just himself.
