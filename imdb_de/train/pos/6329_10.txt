The cult movie for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it is no longer praise. The film is like the book full of symbols: My favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (colloquial Russian word for "devastation" often means the period of lifestyle chaos after the Civil War from 1918 to 1920) - opened dirty door in the brick wall squeaked in the snow-covered wind and the pitch-black hole of the door behind it. <br /> <br /> Now the movie will be released on DVD with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound, which has well translated English subtitles, although some obscene words by Sharikov have been replaced by milder versions in translation. I do not know if this DVD is available overseas, but if you pack it right away, it's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> And finally one fact: about 50% of today's Russians, mostly young people, can be identified as Sharikovs to a considerable extent. It is the post-soviet effect: the Soviets seemed completely unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization. Television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless, making them the darkest instincts of any Russian. Even among Internet users, one in three uses obscene language in forums and chats, as it is surprisingly common in colloquial language.
