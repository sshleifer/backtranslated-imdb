In general, I love these Charlie Chan movies from 1930, and that's no exception. However, this movie seems to be a little bad. A belated attempt to switch from cerebral moto-movies around the storylines to a salad bar that has been pampered with comedy reliefs is as relieving as aching feet. A typical buffoon appears from nowhere and incarnates a clumsy Englishman playing the detective, and even other characters seem to be entangled in the relief of the comedy. The conspiracy may be strange or a mere excuse for us today, but at that time the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but a daily occurrence.
