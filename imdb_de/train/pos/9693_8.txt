I was very surprised by this movie. I was touched by the life that touched Paulie on his way to find his "Marie", the little girl from whom he was separated. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as I would have thought. Actually, I had expected that "paulie will a cracker" jokes would hurt the movie, but even that was in a very humorous scene that gets very touching when paulie is in the press conference of the research lab. So if you want to watch a good movie about Animal That Talks, check out this movie, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE, in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprising twist in the end, which is also very well done.
