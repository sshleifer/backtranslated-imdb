**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the successes of legendary US Navy sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. The unobtrusive, quiet Mr. Rogers looks as if he had already achieved 300 confirmed and unconfirmed military killings by Vietcong and the North Vietnamese military on his two tours in "Nam". This shows how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is cool clam and deadly as Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who stands at the end of his career as a top US Navy sniper, but later realizes in the movie that being a civilian will be futile , There's nothing he has out there with the skills he's learned from the US Marines, unless he decides to become a mob hit man. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifelong professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" focuses on Sgt.Beckett with the support of former sharp silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, who was sent deep into the jungles of Panama. The two snipers are said to exclude the rebellious General Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa and the Colombian Raul Ochoa, Raul Ochoa, who supports him in a planned military takeover of the country. <br /> <br /> We see in the movie Sgt earlier. Beckett got a rebel leader, who in my opinion was the best scene in "Sniper". Because it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a negotiation that was later broken off in the film about the rebellious sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who persecuted Beckett and later killed Papich when they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. They would have thought that between the two a deadly cat and mouse was played, which would culminate after the end of the film, but Sgt. Beckett had no problems with sending DeSilva at the beginning of the film, by an unsuspecting Miller as Bait used. <br /> <br /> What hurt the movie the most, ironically, was the last fifteen or so minutes in which the story went from one shot a Kill Sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fight against a complete battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth the fact that it tells the story of a person who until then tells stories In war movies, it's not really glamorous now: A single killer with the precision and skill of a diamond cutter or kills a trained neurosurgeon and keeps it absolutely secret.
