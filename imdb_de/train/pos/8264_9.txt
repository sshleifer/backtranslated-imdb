This early German talkie (with English subtitles) is based on a mining gap and is still one of the most effective documentary dramas ever made. With many non-professional actors, "camaraderie" gives a disturbing look at the friendship that unites the miners, regardless of which side of the Franco-German border they come from. A fatal accident produces the very best and destroys the instructions of the superiors. A needy miner will receive the help of his comrades, even if he is threatened with great losses, including life. This movie recalls the sacrificial heroism of the NYFD after the 9/11 attacks. Aside from the formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform knew only one reason: to save lives and find their fellow combatants. - More than 70 years later, "camaraderie" still has the strong and timeless message: A friend in need is a friend indeed.
