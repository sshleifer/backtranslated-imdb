This spectacular movie is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows a China that I've never seen or imagined before, and I think it shows the 30s China in the most real light ever seen in a movie. In so many situations it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how hard life was for the characters, yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. In this movie you really see the depths and heights of human existence. The actors are all perfect, so you feel like you've really come to another world. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It can change you forever as soon as you see it.
