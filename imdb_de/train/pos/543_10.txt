This movie is the best horror movie, no bar. I love how Stanley dumps the women in the lake. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years and he blew me away. It's a mix of horror and drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil but charming look took hold of me immediately. I will never forget that look in his eyes. There is something about him, I can not describe it.
