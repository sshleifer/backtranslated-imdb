Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue, a fourteen-year-old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day she finds a secret magical elevator in the basement of her apartment that takes her back to the late 18th century. She meets two others Children who have lost their father and are exposed to poverty. <br /> <br /> I clicked through the channels and found it. I read the summary and suddenly saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought, okay ... and I saw the movie ... I did not know that Elisha had made films before ... 'The Girl Next Door and 24 'Elisha offers a satisfying performance, the plot is a bit cheesy, but the movie works .. It's amazing how this young girl became the hottest baby in Hollywood!
