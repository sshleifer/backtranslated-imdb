A very good movie. A classic science fiction movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers more aliens. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and much of the Imperial forces. The emperor is a somewhat original character. I liked the Ewoks who somehow represented the native savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, that's the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire is finally over. I also appreciated the victory celebration, in which she fulfilled Vader's salvation and returned with Yoda and Obi-Wan to the spirit of Anakin Skywalker. There is a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are under this film: When Vader addresses the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda, and ... his father (1997, not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke Darth backs Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side to this film, though there is a good ending. I felt that there was much more than you can see at first glance. And as always, the music of John William will bring classicism into the Star Wars universe.
