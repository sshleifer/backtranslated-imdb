Stan & Ollie becomes SAP's AT SEA when her wayward little boat is commanded by a vicious killer. <br /> <br /> The guys are wonderful in this role, starting with one of their funniest sets, the Horn Factory. Laurel & Hardy live in a world where icy radios and bedridden goats are the norm, not the exception, always a few steps from the rest of the creation. With its short length, the film with its classic short motifs is rather stylish, which explains its episodic nature. Only the boys get a screen credit, but filmmates will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears As a deceitful doctor, Richard Cramer fully lives up to his role as a villain, the sweet Mary Gordon plays the baffled neighbor of the boys. This is Charlie Hall, as the office worker of the apartment house and the silent screen comic Ben Turpin portrays a very special plumber. One of the film's screenwriters was silent comedian Harry Langdon. However, Stan & Ollie are the focus. If you see Hardy cracking at the horn, or Laurel's antics with bananas, for example, the viewer will be reminded why these guys are the absolute movie giants.
