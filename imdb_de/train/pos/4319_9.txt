The second time watching this movie I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and a perception of life as ordinary and often anxious, but what brings this film to a height that is rarely realized is its focus on the little incidents in our lives that we normally only have the slightest attention spans , Here the film revolves around the celebration of these events, the meeting of a tow driver with a customer, the jogger hearing a baby cry from the bushes. Dialogue, acting, casting and directing are outstanding. No two fours, no great revelations. What I observed was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how their lives improved when they were celebrated. Kudos to all concerned, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
