Seeing "Fox and the kid" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, the integrity of the viewpoint and the utmost beauty of the environment and the characters left me in a swoon of pleasure. The plot is straightforward. Deceptively simple In the vessel of this simplicity unfolds a world that attracts you and makes you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I have learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can count on - give it yourselves. I dare say that it is a love act intended for every innocent heart. It reaches into the heart of the beholder - of all ages - and reveals the world with new eyes, as if it were seen from the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond perspective of ecstatic participation in reality. I have the feeling that I had the privilege to see this film, no, to participate in it, a work of true art.
