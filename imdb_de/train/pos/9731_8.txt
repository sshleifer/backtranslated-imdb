Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular magazine Sharpe, hoping to live his dream lifestyle, but he tries to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book about survival in This American comedy drama received mixed reviews from critics. As inconstantly funny, but charmingly labeled by the actors, it seemed to be a run of mill fish out of the pond to enjoy themselves in another cultural comedy. However, this is not the case picture works due to its actors and the simple but sharp story. We start in the past, then in the present, and work our way forward to see how Young has made a name for himself in one of America's top magazines. Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too sympathetic for words. Whether it's beating zombies with a cricket bat or showing the nature of the law to his buddy, the English actor adds charm and lightheartedness to every scene. Here, if the script is good, but far from its own standards, it brings a lot of energy into the picture and it's worth paying attention to. His antics with "Babe 3" are unforgivable, just as breathtaking as his exuberant dance, but he does it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson show well the stereotypical magazine bosses, in the haze fits nicely to the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can perform here with a hilarious exaggeration of a stereotype movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles plays in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool. To emphasize the point, there is a dog, and Pegg rounds it off in real British comedy, with a small twist. <br /> <br /> Although it is a British film, there is an adaptation of the American lifestyle for Young as he tries, and we can see the different approaches to storytelling. Young wants the right dirty contrast to American professionalism. The inclusion of modern tabloid stars will soon date this movie, but the concept of exploitation of movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> Willow's first picture is not perfect. There are concentration fluctuations, as the action becomes too soapy with an unpleasant obvious turn and too many characters are needed. The physical comedy can also be exaggerated. By the way, the Bloopers on the DVD are among the most beautiful you've ever seen, and are almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> In this comedy drama, Simon Pegg has again a shiny form and the collective approach to storytelling and the sharp comedy is worth seeing.
