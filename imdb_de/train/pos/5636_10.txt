In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small Texas town, sings at The Yellow Rose of Texas, and is admitted to a prestigious art school in Philadelphia. From there, the film grows into a colorful history of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great vocals and drama and characters that moved at a very nice pace. The acting was of course wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as was Nick Roth. The camera work was really good and I was very happy with the end (it seems like there could be a sequel). Kudos to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. A jewel in the film archive.
