Wonderful cult film from 1979, in which students of Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new dictatorship director named Miss Togar (Mary Voronov). Togar is a music hater and blames students for their violations. The charge against them is led by the fun-loving riff Randell (PJ Soles), the # 1 Ramones fan who, more than anything else, wants the rock band to record their songs impossible to resist film. First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists like Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, alongside the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Next, the actors really do everything, with Soles being an ideal choice for the role of the reef. She is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as serious as Tom and Kate, Woronov is dismissed as a typical and contemptuous Togar good against type. Clint Howard has one of his best roles as the washroom entrepreneur Eaglebauer and New World regulars like Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are always fun. And of course it's a pleasure to see the Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie has a true spirit. The energy level is high, and co-story writer and director Allan Arkush brings a lot of flair to the process. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper airplane gag is an excellent example of this. This extends to the "wipe" style of scene transitions. There are even funny giant mice that are caused by future make-up effects, which are highlighted by Rob Bottin in one of his earliest appearances. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is just a wonderful cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
