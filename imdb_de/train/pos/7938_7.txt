Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a lot of kids who do not look like either of them. Basically, Rob and Josie have a wedding on a drunken night while vacationing in Vegas. They all come home to find out that their respective children know the wedding because of tabloid newspapers that are not part of the feeds. They, Rob and Josie, bring both and their eight children to one or the other house. Rob builds furniture, I think, which is close enough to Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy) construction job The very similar step by step to justify eternal ridicule. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of biscuit queen, although she does not seem to make any of the biscuits. Not close enough to Carol Foster's hairdressing job (Suzanne Somers) to justify resemblance to ridicule, but funny enough to justify cruelty mockery the surname of another, or so one assumes, if he's serious enough about a relationship to travel together. <br /> <br /> There are at least eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. Personally, I think they should have called the younger Andrew 'Andy'. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of product placement, especially for soup at hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid, meaningless moments. It's also not a good movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This completes my review of 'Step By Step ... about some really bad drugs'. Watch out for Rob Estes and his pretty eyes! There are some beautiful, pretty eye pictures.
