Having heard of Modesty Blaise but never read a novel or comic, my wife and I really liked the movie. It offered a good introduction to the figure and its background in a captivating way. <br /> <br /> Although it contains some action elements, it is much more of an intimate game that has been excellently written. Unfortunately, this is also the case where a big drawback of the movie is revealed. An intimate piece lives from the abilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast. While Alexandra Staden did a great job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the villain Miklos - did not. He smiles through the plot as if it were an extensive commercial for toothpaste. He does not manage to build an atmosphere of fear that would make the movie a masterpiece. The side cast is similar, from stereotypical gangsters and sluts to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
