I brought some old musicals out of my garage and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. It received two Oscar awards for Best Picture from 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris trying to grow up. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of the media and keen to help, but soon finds herself loving the man. In the meantime, Gene Kelly falls in love with the pretty woman Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I have to say, they are fantastic together on the floor and in other ways. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So, if you like well-lit dances and funny scenes with Oscar Levant's nimble pianos fingers, the songs of George Gershwyn will live on in this colorful piece of jewelry forever. 8.10
