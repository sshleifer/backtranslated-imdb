I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever, as if it was not the best of all three Lion King movies! In the film, Timon and Pumbaa tell where they come from and have trouble teaming with others, like Timon, who has trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa go in search of their dream place and find him and soon him and Simba, who raise them, but soon they have to decide between their dream place or help Simba to see his evil uncle Scar and his right as king to announce the lion's rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was voiced by comedian Jerry Stiller, the father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to cast Stiller in that role! Lion King 1 1/2 is filled with wonderful characters, animations, stories and music and in my opinion the best in every episode and better than Simba's Pride, even though I have to admit that I really liked that! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and is very funny! 10 out of 10!
