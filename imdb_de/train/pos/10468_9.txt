Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From late night hosting with Penn and Teller to the single, Joe Bob Briggs. The show stopped me on Friday night in my high school years, and offered some of the best drive-in memories ever seen outside the drive-in television. If you do not stay up, you have failed. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob, but I want them to be back where they belong. Question ... has anyone else blown out of "The Swarm" every 4 hours? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live monster vision!
