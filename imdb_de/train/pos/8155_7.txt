I'm too old to know (or care) what exactly the difference is between rap and hip-hop. And because I'm a Canadian, I've probably never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I found this movie very funny when I saw it, a bright little satire. The hip-hop culture is so common nowadays that it's hard not to hear about it all the time. (If only we could say the same thing about bagpipe music.) I got the most jokes (at least I think I did). Sure, it's derived from Spinal Tap, but there are many targets that could endure a tap treatment. But not the carpenters, they are holy.
