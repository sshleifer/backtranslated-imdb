The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role), the newest espionage girl in the block, ends his search for his identity, as he also tries to end the latest program of the CIA "Blackbriar" to make super-killer Like him. <br /> <br /> I was so excited about it that I saw its predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was as brilliant as I recall, and Supremacy remains the weak (but still gratifying) link in the chain for the weakest conspiracy, and aside from a chase that trumps the chase of the film easily, there are light action and suspension flaws to watch <br /> Hoo boy, has ultimatum tension? Even if you know that Bourne is going to escape the authorities (and the films are considered inappropriate by the police), it's still brilliant to watch him. It's amazing to think that two men with handguns and mopeds can generate 10x more tension than anything that these $ 150 million robots did in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Do it with Paul Greengrass, who has that idiosyncratic style He made a documentary film, even though he films characters far removed from ordinary characters, such as places like the CIA headquarters where nobody is within a radius of 10 miles with a camcorder would be allowed. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is no less than impressive. Various weapons used as weapons were a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never look at them like this again). and an electric fan (do not ask). The music has also helped to create a lot of excitement, and there was hardly a moment not to crack. <br /> <br /> The play is good, and the development of Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" brings her situation into a situation of a new most sympathetic light. Damon plays his key role with restraint, but competence (which may sound minor, but it really looks like Matt Damon might elude the CIA and Interpol is special), but notable moments of sharpness while he is still around his humanity is fighting. This longing for a real life could get boring and would have almost gone into supremacy, but works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I recall a scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good movie by Pierce Brosnan Bond) in which Sean Bean's character James asks if the Martinis cries out the screams of all the men he killed to silence. Bourne deplores all the people he has killed, and he thinks it makes sense (or at least thought) that life is meaningless and how the government transforms people into resources. Resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: It has always bothered me that while he is a superspy and being chased by the CIA, Interpol and the police, almost everywhere he goes, Bourne never thought of it, even the Trying to conceal his facial features or fake new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and love action movies then Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Damn, it's probably the best action movie that came out this year. Of course it would be a fool to see it without first seeing the others. It draws a kind of end to end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook that. This is the first "3" movie this summer that is at least equal to the original, if not exceeded, and that says something. <br /> <br /> A-
