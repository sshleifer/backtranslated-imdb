Make yourself comfortable on a dark and stormy night and be prepared to be alternately amused, irritated and scared. The creaking old conspiracy about a phantom train that is said to drive through the lonely English countryside in the middle of the night is not plausible, but it's a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "THE ACCIDENT" that the locals can remember but do not talk about. Above all, the film is for the comedian Arthur Askey a vehicle to present his special kind of vaudeville humor between the scary pieces. The insane humor of Askey is not very popular these days, but if you just let it wash over you, it can be fun. This is probably the best movie from Askey.
