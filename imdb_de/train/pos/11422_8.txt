Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film shows a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon and gives the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often amazingly inadequate. A central theme in history, for example, is the inability of young France to build strong relationships with others. Although this depiction is flawlessly executed, especially in the way Denis framed the story with scenes from France's return to childhood, the girl's lack of intimacy with the other characters in the film makes it difficult for the viewer to take much interest in him Investing in development (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of character development of the film makes it difficult to participate in the loosely organized conspiracy. The film leads to tensions between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men in their lives, but never addresses these social tensions and leaves the viewer unsatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical perspective, but if you're looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not your best bet.
