Thats My Bush is, above all, a very entertaining show by Parker and Stone, I thought. It is often very funny and quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would certainly get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. For this, a lot of money must have been invested. Many expensive little details. It is not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they obviously put a lot into this show. In a way, I understand that even the death of the show was too expensive. It could certainly have gone cheaper and went there by will. <br /> <br /> The critics liked it, and although it had its small fan base, it did not succeed in attracting a large audience. As we know, the show was stopped after 8 episodes, which is almost a season. <br /> <br /> Since I really liked the show, she has her mistakes. The problem with the show is that she does not know what she really wants to be. It's like trying to be both a sitcom AND a parody of a sitcom. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well-staffed, but in my opinion, they do not always seem to have 100% of the bizarre humor they are supposed to present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the show needed some characters who were down-to-earth to make the show work. In South Park, there are Kyle and Stan, which represent a realistic note in the more realistic universe. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need some decent characters that you can deal with realistically, and that makes the madman so much more interesting because it forces you to take her seriously on some level. If it's all archetypes and stereotypes, it's hard to get emotionally involved in the show, which is Thats My Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park who understand the madness on the show. We have nothing like this here and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another anchor point is Parker and Stones flirting with Republicans. It's the only thing I do not really understand what they're trying to do. Not depicting Bush as nothing more than a stupid loveable figure by Homer Simpsons is subversive in a world where many people who do not like him and think he's the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedic world of letterman and so it just satirizes every one of his moves ... but it's hard to see if Parker and Stone really mean anything with it. It's as if the joke is affecting us, but somehow it does not hit the mark. It seems awkward because it does not remind you of the true Bush at all. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the show. Some of the jokes here are funny. The pro-life supporter, who was a surviving chipped fetus, is probably one of my favorite jokes on every show. And the show is packed with great stuff and is sometimes hilarious if you use your head a little while watching it.
