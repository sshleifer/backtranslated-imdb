ATTENTION SPOILERS. This movie was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two. Okay, the stranger Goofie, who (SPOILER HERE) deals with the biker for his clothes, was funny. The boss of this guy was good too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two would have had much more time on the screen. The chemistry was great. The bathroom WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a stupid cocktail waitress who rescues a stranger and lands in the middle of a plot of land due to the greed of politicians at Whitehouse. Talking about Sarandon would give a lot. SPOILER This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy, and satisfies both - the political side much more than the romantic one. It touches on political issues and barely touches on romantic areas. <br /> <br />
