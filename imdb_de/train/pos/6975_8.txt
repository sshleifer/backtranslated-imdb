If I had just seen the pilot of this show, I would have rated him 10. I was immediately fascinated by this beautiful new world. Subsequent episodes did not fully live up to the promise, but I'll keep watching and hope it keeps getting better. The production values ​​are incredible and the action is first class. I do not mind that it does not fit perfectly with BSG because I'm so fascinated by the premise that we show two different shows. I'm thrilled that both Esai Morales and Eric Stoltz, one of my absolute favorites, are back in my life (albeit only weekly) as I've missed them both. This is a show that requires a bit of thought from the audience and that is always a good thing. You need to wrap your mind around certain aspects of the show; Things are not always what they seem, and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in lines of action, characters and, of course, the different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the ride seems pretty exciting.
