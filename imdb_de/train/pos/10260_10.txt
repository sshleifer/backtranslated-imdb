The first part of this notorious horror series features a woman abducted by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before being killed. She is cruelly beaten, thrown around endlessly in the chair, her nails pulled, animal guts are thrown at her, hot boiling water is poured on her, and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle (really sick and unpleasant scene) One is what one does Snuff movie comes closest, without committing a murder on tape. Of course, some of the special effects are rather bad, but the idea of ​​making a snuff is pretty cruel. I have also seen "flowers of flesh and blood". This is more bloody and sadistic but less disturbing. Anyway, this is a must for horror fans!
