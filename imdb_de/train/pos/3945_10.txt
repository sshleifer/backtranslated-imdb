The rating is only 5 because it's a movie that could have been used for better acting and directing (or at least music!). However, for the achievements of Walt Whitman, it deserves a 10th A previous poster called the film as cheesy, but I think it is a simple case, if the forest is not seen in front of the trees. The filmmakers were apparently more interested in publishing the story than a brilliant Hollywood movie. And for that I welcome them - the fact that they are not mainstream also reflects the life of Whitman. This film is more documentary than actors. It is most important to be fascinated by a story like this when one seldom hears of such stories shaping today's mental health. I found it very enjoyable to look at the story.
