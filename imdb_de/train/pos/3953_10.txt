I saw this movie on TV when it came out and never saw it again. For the life of me, I could not remember the title and just tripped over it while checking Roy Thinne's movie credits. Excellent, dark and scary TV horror movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and "Satan's School for Girls," all lost satanic classics. I also think that there are many parallels to Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why not publish these great little movies, especially when you look at the latest garbage filling the discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these films have a cult following, so selling should not be a problem.
