Anyone who has chosen less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean, humorous humor. Keaton is brilliant in that - as in most of his work. This is not a blockbuster, a larger-than-life affair. This is Campy slapstick humor played by some of Hollywood's best (and very versatile) actors. Piscopo used to be just like the best dog that ever came into the world. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the funniest attempt not really to curse, you have to see that Dimitri plays his piece as a Morone. </ I gave him a 7.
