I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best "National Lampoon" movies. He also has a very catchy parody title that basically summarizes what the movie is all about ... Men In White !!!! The story is a parody of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you may have guessed "Men In Black". I will not give up the end, but it has a very good ending. It's very funny (Leslie Nielsen humor) from start to finish, especially the beginning when you're out in the street collecting the garbage cans. They also have a pretty cool Garbage Collecting Truck in this scene. Acting is not great, actually not very good, but that makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, easy on !! I love the story, partly because it's so far-fetched and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or should it be inconspicuous) they tear down all the other films. I'm a big fan of non-serious spoof movies, but I'm also a fan of the real thing, and those movies are hard to decide which one is better. The movie basically breaks off (mentioned earlier in this post) or the actual movie is, but even if you're actually making a parody of comedy movies, it actually makes it even harder, but this movie wins it off successfully. The two garbage men are so funny that they remind me of a sketch show titled "Little Britain" in the UK. This film is a must-have for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best acts of National Lampoon.
