I saw this movie in 1969, when it was first released at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now the Crowbar Night Club. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie was really well received. It has everything. The gap between the generations, the sexual revolution, the pursuit of success and the conflict between the "traditions" of the family and those who seek their own way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast-paced, very entertaining movie. Vegas was at its hippest peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. A very nice time over everything. <br /> <br /> The poster from this movie is on my bedroom wall. I look at it and go back in time; a time of my youth and my time with my father, a great time in my life.
