Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not help but have mixed feelings about the entire movie. It's definitely a great way to spend about an hour and fifteen minutes. But there is nothing that gives you the same feeling as the Lion King. For those who have not read the other reviews, it is about meeting Timon and Pumbaa and how they affect the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are actually some very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is in showing how Simba is raised. The worst thing for me, however, must be to show that Timon and Pumbaa directly affect the events of the original. I can never look at the sequences "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" the same way again (I'm fine with the sequence "I can not wait to be king"). <br /> <br /> The singing talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, as does Matthew Broderick, the man who makes Rafiki and the hyenas. Even the actor who does the young Simba sounded enough to me like Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why do you even have a voice actor for Zazu with you? He literally had only two lines and both were not necessary. The additions to Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, though you still can not hear Timon's mum's voice and do not think about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to fit the original that comes to my mind when it comes to pride in the end. How did they have time to get involved in the first fight with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD itself is concerned, one can not help feeling that a 2-disc set lacks special features. You could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the first disc. I enjoyed the game "Wants King of the Jungle," even though it's the most shameful example of cross-promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are actually difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall a good movie, though not nearly as good as TLK or even TLK2.
