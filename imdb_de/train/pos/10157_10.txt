This is an entertaining gospel look by Johnny Cash (of course adorned in black), who sings a lot and also tells a little bit. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is very enjoyable. Also note the blonde representation of Jesus in this work. Just for fun do you think of five Jewish men who have fair hair ...? In any case, it's a funny presentation of the biggest and most important story of all.
