I do not think most of us use the term "must-see" for action movies, but I was very impressed with how good this movie was, and rightfully got the "must-see" stamp from me. <Br Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee), is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who breaks through a diamond syndicate in a museum and receives ample rewards , They hardly know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds) who were previously despised by Mandy and Martin to complete the deal, also want to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> Just like every thief couple planning robbery is a thrill. Things are going awry when Martin and Mandy are unknowingly one step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You'll be thrilled with these thieves as they need each other to stay alive by the crime syndicate who are not at all pleased that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed because there is a healthy dose of firearms, martial arts and melee sequences. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing is that not only does the action carry the movie, but also the romance and laughter (and I do not mean your typical one-liners that are common in action movies), the sneaking in /> <br /> It's not easy to root for bad guys, but we can see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and one NOT to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
