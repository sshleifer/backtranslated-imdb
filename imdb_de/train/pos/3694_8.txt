I was not sure what to expect from this film given its amazing collection of stars and directors, but in the end it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the last episode with the American tourist. I spoke with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better with mine), which was actually very touching and was a great opportunity Finish film. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stinging victim was also a big move and for comedy the Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi accept the award. The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive, albeit ambitious in scope. <br /> <br /> The Bob Hoskins segment, however, was absolutely choppy and the vampire story was utterly absurd. The dialogue in Wes Craven's department was also very forced, and the Chinatown story was completely incomprehensible. Overall, this movie is worth to be seen for the good parts, and it has a strong degree. It's not too painful to go through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
