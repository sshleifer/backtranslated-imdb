The affluent psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels downcast about her job. She feels that it is hopeless to help her patients. A young customer from the gambling junkie asks her to help him pay off his debts if he really wants to help him get better. Here she is involved with Joe Mantegna. If you reveal more of the plot, it would be a damn funny movie and House of Games could be the best Con movie I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem, full of snappy dialogues, great one-liners and enough twists to keep you guessing to the end. Perfectly suited as a sincere psychiatrist in need of change, Mansegna towers above her as a diabolically insidious journeyman. With the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film has complete control over the audience. and we love the con. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
