What could be more sloppy than the idea that private detectives get involved with the women they are supposed to spy on? And most of the dialogue as it was written is completely banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors make dialogue meaningful. You see real people behind the unreal lines. And the direction is wonderful. Each scene does exactly what it has to do and ends without pulling too long. <br /> <br /> I showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because I was amazed how such a material can be turned into such a good material. The friends also enjoyed it.
