Luckily, I recently saw this on a plane to Singapore (I thought I missed it at Cinemalaya Filmfest). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (each about 5 minutes) of 20 directors who show love in different pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is 'Parc Monceau' by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), filmed in a continuous recording with Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The "Tuileries" of the Coen brothers with Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the metro was weird! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" had a lot to do. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / drugstore in the 'Enfants Rouges' neighborhood, in such a short time to have shown anticipation and heartache The time was just great. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a sweet couple in Wes Craven's 'Pre-Lachaise'. <Natalie Portman was as beautiful as the girlfriend of the actress of a visually impaired French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many depictions of young love, a more mature Gena Rowlands performance in 'Latin Quarter' was equally impressive. <br /> <br /> This film is perfect for those who have ADHD, because every sequence is carefully thought out. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One of them is a deceitful husband who eventually leaves his lover with his dying wife in his last days: "By pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
