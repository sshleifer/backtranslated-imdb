Little SPOILERS alert !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say so myself because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the name of director Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are below-average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films, and maybe he should have shot horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. It was a good performance as there were no famous actors or a big budget. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains loyal and loyal to the truth. It explains the life of the Roman Earl Dracula and how he deterred the Turkish army with a mortuary in front of his castle. At this point, of course, the reality and the "based on a true story" stops. The blood consumption and everything else was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the USA and seduces a lot of women. And they are all pretty girls, I give that to him. All in all a good spectacle of unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy the morbid horror fans, and an interesting plot. This movie is really unknown and was hidden in my local video store on the darkest shelf. But it is definitely worth to clean the dust from the cover and place it in the VCR. It's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing else in common, but I blame this movie for having taken the attention of this beautiful little picture. Check it out ... my modest opinion on To The For = 8.5 / 10
