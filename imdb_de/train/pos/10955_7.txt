I originally rated Sarah's show as a beautiful, fat eight, but I've had a little bit of her humor lately, and a thin 7 is what settled in. I will explain. <br /> <br /> You will either like Sarah's humor or you will not. If you do not, I doubt anyone can convince you. They know who you are and it's fine, but you know that too. In the first season, there was fantastic information about Sarah, her friends and family, and her activities in life. In a memorable episode, she is "pulled" by Officer Jay, whom she meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm here?" he asks. "Because you all have C in high school?" she answers questioningly. It seemed like a real question. - That's weird in my book. Sarah can come to you from odd angles. In another episode, her affair with God was especially funny. God, who is petty and jealous, wonderfully contributed to the joke. It's wise, it's a twisted view, but it would show us the truth in humor and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although still not without a new and imaginative comedy, we seem to have crept into banal junk and fart jokes. I laugh here and there, but much of it seems to be a filler, while she and the authors have a hard time fanning original material. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings I've had lately for the episodes, but I've erased it after the gems I find (the turtle) and waited for them to spin it. I was a fan of her routine "Jesus is magic" and would like to believe that I understand what she is capable of. Let us come back to that.
