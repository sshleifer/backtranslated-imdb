Let me first say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the gay title. Next, I think Regal should have got his European title back, Jeff Hardy is a shitty champion. Rob Van Dam has had the Intercontinental title too long. Brock should have won him. I am satisfied with Storm and Christian who are tag champions. The best match, in my opinion, was the match between Booker T and Big Show.
