An LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys come to sweep the fireplaces at Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenating serum. Stan & Ollie continue with their DIRTY WORK, spreading destruction in the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit abrupt, but the slapstick that leads to it is great. Especially good is the will contest of Stan & Ollie at the opposite ends of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
