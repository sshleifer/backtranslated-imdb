The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anybody has seen creatures of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, who has a fake nose, is scary as Lincoln, with the voice, the delivery, the walking and other behaviors - just as one imagines Lincoln. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he shot with Fonda, is at the top of its form and is a perfect reminder of early 19th century America. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder defending Lincoln, and the scenes in the courtroom are pretty well done. The side cast includes many of Ford's regulars. This was Alice Brady's last movie when she died months after its release.
