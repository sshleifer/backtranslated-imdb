I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favorite of Stan and Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this are Stan and Ollie chimney sweep and get the order to clean the chimney at Professor Noodle's home (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle performs crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos when they try to clean the chimney and create a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a container with a special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this makes him a chimpanzee! The best is when Ollie falls down the chimney and lands bricks on his head, but he does not seem to be in much pain. Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie the funniest. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
