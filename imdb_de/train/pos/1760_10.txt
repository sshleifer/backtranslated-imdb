THE 40 YEARS OF VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by the multi-year second banana Carell in a truly extraordinary comic breakthrough performance that puts him on the A-list), a tech service representative for an electronics store in Southern California learned of its mysterious identity through a trio of well-meaning, but totally unsuspecting, fellow-female colleagues (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree more merry than the other) determined to deflower their friend at any cost. What follows is an unlikely but very heartfelt romance with a spirited mother (the wonderful Keener who has a lot of fun here), which causes the fire within Andy to be filled with more fuel. A surprisingly good-natured and unapologetic raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since "Crazy for Mary" with a thoughtful, attentive script by director Judd Apatow and Carell, which includes some stunningly penetrating sequences, including a hugely accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribs, and 'Date a Paloozas' send-ups and demystify the war of the sexes with bold serenity. A real winner and an instant classic. the funniest movie of the year.
