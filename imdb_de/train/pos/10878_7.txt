Personally, I liked Cut so much. It was the first time I saw a theatrically released Australian Slasher strip. A genre that is usually limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the usual funny comedies and dramas coming from Australia, I loved seeing a local horror movie that was not rip-offs. I did not even think it was really a parody of other films. It was a supernatural horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what you did last summer, so there was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it's about time that Australian movies are more immersed in mainstream genres. <br /> <br /> Cut was original, weird enough and finally just a bit of fun. I would give it seven out of ten and not treat it as serious. It did what I expected, entertained and frightened me enough to be satisfying. I enjoyed it.
