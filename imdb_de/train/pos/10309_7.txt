Now you either like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. Me, Myself and Irene had an audience that went out in droves as well as cheered and collapsed in funny puddles. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure, look at the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed about the same gags when I saw the movie. If you do not find the sight of a dog dropping the seat after using the toilet funny, do not make the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a reporter sitting in a rut and covering "light news" is abusing God when all his life goes into the pot. God accepts the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do it better. Carrey gets in the swing of possessing all the powers of God by magnifying his girlfriend's (Jennifer Aniston) breasts, promoting himself and answering the prayers of all individuals with a single computer command Highbrow Movie or even the memorable, but it's very good made in its very limited intent, Carrey fans give almost uninterrupted laughter, and even religious cheese dairy is probably harmless -god-squadders for all but the closest minds and anti-attackers. <br /> <br /> On the more thoughtful level, the movie lures us into speculating on Carrey's own career. In his "comedy" keyboard, he has hardly left an impression as a serious actor after winning two Golden Globes. His most successful "direct" role, the Man on the Moon, is less known for his comedy - or the Truman Show (on which the Academy piled up three nominations, bypassing Carrey).
