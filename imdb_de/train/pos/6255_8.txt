This film shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who humble other peoples and are cruel to other peoples. It shows the inability of people to communicate or speak with others. <br /> <br /> At the screening I attended, people walked in because they could not see the movie anymore. And rightly so. The movie is not easy and you can just see it. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of mercy in the movie. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste. You can not speak of enjoyment of this movie. It holds you in the throat and never lets you go and in the end you just feel breathless because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "not recommend" this movie. You should form your own opinion based on what I said earlier. But be aware that this is not a regular movie and not for everyone.
