I read the book in fifth grade and saw the movie a few years later. There are a few differences: 1. Bill should probably eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms on a day at 19:00. <br /> <br /> 2. Bill is believed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. After Billy has eaten all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to fake some of the worms, but in the movie he does not do that at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this movie is still fun for kids.
