Thanks to a clever script and a calm hand by writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very likeable mystery thriller. The film starts methodically and absorbs steam as the clues show that nothing is as it seems. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great as they team up to solve the mystery and remember Nick and Nora Charles from the "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is awesome as Alex McArthur's tormented wife and the roles played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and provide plenty of light for the right moments. There is even a cameo by Rex Linn. Overall, I felt like reading a good book by the fire.
