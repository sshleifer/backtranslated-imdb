First time seen: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive script and comedic drama and timing in this movie. It is now 40 years old and has lost no strength. Neil Simon shows excellent insights into human nature and relationships and shows how unusual situations can make real comedy. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedy performances. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the piece on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best Hollywood comedies ever! Surprisingly only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood rarely forgives comedies, no matter how well they are made.
