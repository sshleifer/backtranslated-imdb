I have read most of the comments published here and I can say that most of these posters have big problems in life. This show was fun unlike most game shows. Mr. Shatner, whose brilliant in all things he is, was again the hit of the show. He is a really bubbly person who shines like a beacon wherever he goes. It's fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show does. The dancers & questions, the all-around fashion that they present, only add to the appeal of the shows. And although a lot of money is at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here. Several people who posted messages complained about how much time was spent on the dancers and the selection of questions. Just as Millionaire has no comparable time wasters. All I can say is that most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and have fun. There is something for everybody. Questions to test your knowledge, eye candy (the dancers), suspense, Mr. Shatner's wonderful, fun personality ... if that's not a fuss, then I feel bad for you; and if that is not enough, YOU CAN RICH! I really miss the show. From ALL the gameshows that have ever played, and to be honest, I hate game shows. This is the one I really liked and really miss. The only other game show I've ever liked was Match Game.
