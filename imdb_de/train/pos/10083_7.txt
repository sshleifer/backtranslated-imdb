The fact that this film was aired on DVD and still formatted for the TV and really annoys a lot of film purists with a blurry image ... and rightly so. This deserves a much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street artist who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day), and instead ends up with a little girl (not conventionally) way) .... and the Problems that arise afterwards. The old man had bought the child at a slave auction and soon discovered that the child was not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind." weird looking with a missing front tooth and a contagious grin. The little girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a sweet guy. The rest of the story is how the two get along getting a bit carried away in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a story with drama, excitement, humor and grief. Just do not expect to get a good picture of good quality for your money. DVD: Until it appears on widescreen, lend it.
