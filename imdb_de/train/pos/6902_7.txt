This is a modest, character-driven comedy filmed on a low budget in Brazil. The premise is well known, just like in the 50's of the Danny Kaye movie ** On the Double **: Someone who makes a joke about a famous person as a joke is then forced to pose as a person. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two ports is extremely effective. Raul Julia as a German-Paradorian secret police officer is tall, cool, threatening and Latin. He wears a deliberately obvious blond job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jew, is funny and sympathetic. There are many references and insider jokes about the show business. <br /> <br /> The attitude is clearly based on Paraguay. Paraguay was actually ruled from the fifties to the late eighties by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unselected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. However, writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with large differences in wealth and an active guerrilla uprising. In this regard, Mazursky dismisses the American comic Jonathan Winters, who in reality C.I.A. Station leader in Parador and a figure so powerful that she can give the President of the country a mundane chewing. <br /> <br /> In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, largely due to social and racial tensions in other regions of the region. This is because in the 19th and 20th centuries the country waged long and costly wars against much larger neighbors. The male population was almost eradicated on both occasions, but the emerging society was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level, feminism in the form of the Madonna figure bends. Madonna, played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, is a former dancer in the nightclub who is the full-time presidential girl at the beginning of the film, but is ultimately seen as president herself - now politically and cosmetically correct, with no make-up and crash withdrawn, swept away to office by a velvet revolution. The only time that such an event actually took place in Latin America was the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never held office) two years after the death of her husband, the legendary Juan Peron.
