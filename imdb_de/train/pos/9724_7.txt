I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she's the kind of actress who better not act in front of the camera, just be herself. She did that and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried, especially in the first half of the film, to add more artificial productions, so that she looked more like a sober lector. In the other half, she's completely back in her everyday life, and I just could not tell her that she should be an editor. Therefore, their performance in this movie is not lasting. <br /> <br /> The film is overall appealing and inspiring. Young's character is full and sensible. In any case, the film tells a great and refined story. <br /> <br /> The only big mistake is that there was no turning point in the hero's and hero's love story. I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because that is rather unclear for the two people.
