I know, I know it was a good ending, but truly it was great. I love it when a movie ends in a dreadful, dark nature, but this time I was impressed when Darth Vader turned against the Emperor. I was really surprised. The agonizing sequence in this film was when Luke was tortured and defeated by Kaiser / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, removes his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the ships of the rebel warships and all Imperial warships and Super Star destroyers. I loved the new race that brought the Mon Calomari on the screen, the Ewoks, the Sullesteian (Landos co-pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are featured in this movie: 1 - When Vader The Emperor is destroyed and mortally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) appears (the biggest scene in Star Wars). 3- When LEia kills Jabba, who strangles Hutt's criminal. <br /> <br Personally, I like the script and the battle of Endor, which features a ground combat and a space combat as well as the best duel between Star Wars between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-Script: The scenes with Leia in Sklavenbikini are memorable. 10.9.
