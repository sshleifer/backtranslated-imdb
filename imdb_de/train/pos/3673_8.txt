In 2004, I saw "True," Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and loved it. It became my favorite short film and I have come to appreciate the format so much. Of course I wanted to see the whole movie, and I would even see who was attached. Yesterday I saw it finally, thanks to the internet. <br /> <br /> First I just have to say that it looks great. The photography is beautiful in every short and shot scene, in the worst case nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later, I read the little things here, and maybe scanning in 6K will do more justice to DP's work. My special favorites are the first scene "Quais de Seine" (the sunlight!), The Sin City Quarter (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know what the hell I am Like all: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still makes me nervous with these brilliant colors (my eyes are shaking!) And "Quartier Latin" is gold caught on silver. Nice. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the content. I like (and I mean VERY MUCH) the very successful eclecticism. They never have the same themes or treatments between two short films, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all these artists to explore beautiful and profound things in the short films. I loved coming to a modest monologue from a simple love story to a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder for a social commentary on a terror comedy. I love surprises! And this movie has it! It's great that they took the opportunity to let all these directors out of things that are not common in mainstream cinema (which I despise too much). It's not difficult experimentally, but I can breathe the breathing space of these people. <br /> <br /> I like the little time and I love acting. I love the simplicity and I love the love. I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it is a movie that is very nice to see alone or with someone. Feel simple. I felt very good. <br /> <br /> There is something serious about it ... it is so open ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, for me, there are two shorts that are not the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good-natured, safe and maybe even necessary, but feels too much like a commercial?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" love the acting, I feel that the subjects were forced. But that's just me, of course. I also did not love "Tour Eiffel", but I think it's probably because of my very different sensibility to Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this movie has a special interest in people who already know the actor and the directors, and so they can relate to their interaction, the surprises (pay attention to Alexander Payne in a funny role), and basically " What will this director do with it? I really enjoyed it that way. <br /> <br /> I repeat it now: Most of the shorts I've loved and all together make a nice and energetic mix. I can do it on everyone Recommend Case Definitely !!! So, look at it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
