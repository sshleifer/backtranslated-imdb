Every movie in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph to the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a Touch of Evil. Please see them all! He tends to be pompous and selfish in films like F for Fake, really stupid waste of film. Do not waste your time looking at it. it is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who studies film should see everything he has done. All of his leading actors are enormous, but in the end Welles became a fat drunk like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant or John Wayne. I could go on, but I digress ... and because I'm a woman, I can see the pull on him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers and unless you count the filmmakers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers can not compete with the filmmakers of the Forties! I know that there are many other great filmmakers today, but in such a short time, I can not name them all. No insult to one of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of some aspiring filmmakers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the movies now, but there are very few that I would put on a "100 best" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, so did "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you." "from a line in Sullivan's Travels, another beautiful movie from the forties! Can someone give me a best list for the 90's and to 2006? I'd like to know who to see! Thanks a lot! Also props on this site! Where else can you put a movie or boo! I love to rant and rave about people like me who can say what I want, and I promise not to spoil a movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
