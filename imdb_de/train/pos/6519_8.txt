This film has big stars in its early years: Ingor Stevens never looked prettier; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, who came into conflict with his piracy and wanted neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job as Andrew Jackson, but a few moments were stilted a bit. It is really a good movie for the students to learn this part of our story, and it shows that all the happy ends do NOT cause the lovers to meet - sometimes the happier ending is that they leave and partners with a similar background they will understand them better in the long term. I have seen it at least twice every year for 16 years; And although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
