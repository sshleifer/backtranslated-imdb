10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those images under the radar that are soaked in the simplicity that most independent films have: Honorable ad-hoc appearances of their two main roles - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, which are quite complementary, though also create an unlikely duo. The great thing is that the entire movie seems unlikely despite its "road movie" roots. How Morgan Freeman's unnamed character arrives mentally (not physically) where he meets this run-down check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current boss (who also happened to be with her strange man played by Bobby Cannavale) in a small outfit Relationship maintains role) somehow remains to deduce as testimony, and their witty banter - two persons on the opposite side of the company coin - are deceptively simple. In short, there is no bang! Moments of earth-shattering revelations, this movie is a bizarre little sentiment that has probably been lost in the Shuffle of Indies that came out in 2006, but deserves to be seen, if only for its honesty.
