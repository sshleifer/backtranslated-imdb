This is the story of Australian commandos arrested after a raid on the uniform. Since they do not have a uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for her heroism, authorizes the death of a warrior. Under Bushido, of course, this means that they have to be beheaded. A fate that they are not prepared for as Westerners.
