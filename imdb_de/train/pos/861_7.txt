What can you say when you see a good French movie trying to draw an exciting story in line with the social background of the characters? The most important thing is that we believe in these characters, and once they get together, we want them to stay together. It is simple and very efficient. The back story is less important. Why is the script on the side of a semi-developed thriller? It helps to stay away from the social demonstrations that most French movie idiots like to do. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just an entertaining French film with good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the clever noir points in the script, the end is way too easy. It's as simple as Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a Noir movie), but with a less compelling context. I am surprised that the character of the probation officer was not deleted. He brings very little to the story; If he appears alone, we wonder if we have never missed a part. Jacques Audiard is not a freshman yet. Strange and funny.
