Tigerland is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, and in my opinion, it even surpasses the full metal jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell and is a personality that will be remembered long after the movie ends. The ending is brilliantly cut by Schumacher - with the melodious harmony song and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. What a movie.
