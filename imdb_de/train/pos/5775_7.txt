Guys, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie years ago before the Late Night Creature features. It's a great, cheesy monster movie with incredibly funny acting and two wonderfully idiotic hillbillies that contribute to the Schlock factor. The two Redneck boat rental guys are the movie! LOL, and you'll love the boating scene, where the Englishman and his wife talk about all the stars, and it's noon and sunny. Damn funny !!! You realize that they just did not care, they wanted to shoot the film as quickly as possible. The bottom line is you'll love it if you love the 70s beat.
