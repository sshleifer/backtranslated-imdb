If the scriptwriter and the director had the intention to open hearts with the film, as the musician wanted to do with his music, it would work with me. Everyday human situations became original, personal and immediate, so that I personally felt touched by every situation. I think I would appreciate the power of the music along with the perspective of the person writing the film. Without spoiling, I can say that the film's approach to life has moved me a lot. Did not you really cry from what joy? Empathy? only deep emotion? in a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
