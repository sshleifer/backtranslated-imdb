ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (by the way very well played) who loves football. Malone's cousin leads him the night before his big game to an adventure with many twists and turns with two sports bags, a drug lord, hard bikers, some cops and some prostitutes Characters are on which side of the law, what is the contents of a sports bag and even which gender is a keybiker. Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STICK AND TWO SMOKING barrels. For me, ROLL reiterated three opinions that I already had before seeing ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia someday. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool place for a vacation. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in Australia are Australians. Particularly impressive was the cinematography in ROLL. I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are hot!
