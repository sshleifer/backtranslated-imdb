This film reminds us how easy it is for many to engage in the hectic work of doing nothing. We, as people of African descent, owe it to ourselves to change this cycle of "talk all and no action" and realize that change is needed. There is less talk and more needs to be done. It is a powerful statement about the divisions of our people in terms of small issues and our failure to recognize the big picture and the need to band together to make a difference ... Despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message this movie is supposed to depict.
