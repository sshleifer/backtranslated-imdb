I really enjoyed this movie. The acting of the adult actors was great, although I found the main child a bit stiff. But he was doing very well to be a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not like in most Hollywood comedy junkies. That The crazy professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff, you probably do not want to, because it's a bit slower. I recorded it on Blu-ray and I have to say that the picture quality is first class. Probably one of the better-looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They've deleted a good deal, but that's probably a good thing, since most of the deleted scenes really did not add anything.
