Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and his eleven friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" will pimp his wheelchair. <br /> <I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. It has played twice during the festival. This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of Weems friends. I do not often say that about movies, but after seeing this movie, I feel moved to do something about it. At every festival this film participated in, this film won a prize. It's at the Tribeca Film Festival and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went through to the Academy Awards. It's out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie wherever it is, then go! Take as many people as possible and go! It's off to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I'm assuming tickets for the show in Atlanta will sell out quickly if they're not already there. Please watch this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kisch
