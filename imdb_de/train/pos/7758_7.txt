An overblown melodrama, typical of his time (mid-1950s) and corresponding matinee meal. Rock Hudson, the Hulk who everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotype role, while Giant just went well in the same year his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average Not good enough to raise the caliber of the delicate story of how difficult it is to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, drumming through the movie in a drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, who totally spoils a vampy, poor, little, rich girl) end up with the losers and Hudson gets Bacall - who rather, there is wood in this part that does not have enough character or wit to make it work. Oscar Wilde, the good ends happy and the evil unhappy, that is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story that confirmed the storyline. Homosexuality, like other films of that time, is heterosexually disguised. Maybe the film could be redone: Stack's character would sound more true if he hides homosexual feelings for Mitch by marrying. Todd Haynes 'Far From Heaven' improved significantly from All That Heaven Allows, also led by Sirk. Maybe Haynes could rebuild Written on the Wind and give us a really memorable movie.
