This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances. William Tracey as Pepi is a pleasure and brings sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas is the only "villain" in the movie, and his oily charms come into their own. Frank Morgan is adorable as the owner of the title store, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar style is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart as Pirovitch. Very credible in every facet of his role. <br /> <br /> The two approaches are equally fulfilled, with Margaret Sullivan doing an excellent job and representing a slightly desperate, neurotic, but charming and attractive woman. This film, however, belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from his point of view, with the plot revolving around him. Mr. Stewart is more than the job of transporting the film, with an amazing performance that uses a variety of emotions. Watch as Stewart is dismissed for a misunderstanding. He can so perfectly convey the shock, anger, anxiety, and embarrassment of such a traumatic event. In my estimation, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest movie actor in the history of the medium. There is no one who has ever been caught in the film and who can convey the audience so completely what he feels. By the time he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, but he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best films and also one of the sweetest and most beautiful romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who value Stewart's work.
