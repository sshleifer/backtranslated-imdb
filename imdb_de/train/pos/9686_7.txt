A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (with a disability) who appreciates her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and speaks like a human and gives advice and help to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. Sometimes mischievous and sometimes depressing, the bird catches the mood in a remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this smart little bird exists. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie, her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker, and the following scenes tell the story of Paulie's ongoing struggle for reunion with his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he gets into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people who use the ATMs. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who wants it differently. Kids will love this movie and anyone who keeps a bird as a pet will love Paulie's antics.
