This is one of those films that examine the culture struggle of East-born people in Western-influenced cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, a rock n'roll fanatic, marries the Japanese girl Kyoto so she can stay in the United States after her visa expires. It is expected that marriage will be temporary, ie. H., Until Kyoto regains legal status. But Ken, who seems to be lost in every respect, has a taste for Kyoto and is eager to make it work. This, in spite of his friend's request, that letting go of Kyoto and letting go of all obligations to girls for rock'n'roll is bad, unless to inspire some songwriting about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. She also feels homesick and wants to return to Japan. It is sad that this is finally someone that Ken believes he can love and be with, and all, except when he thinks he has found someone who feels that the girl is not expecting to stay that long. It's not that she does not like Ken, it's just that she's used to a completely different way of life. She says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a killer 80s Techno Nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I recorded Loving at Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80's movies, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who have enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time, visit Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese-American cover band), unless it's a happy ending movie. <br /> <br />
