Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that everyone can feel compassion for. Although her house was dirty, this is somehow understandable given her mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the coping skills of an eight-year-old." It reminded me of this when Big Edie said to Little Edie in the dramatic 2009 version, "If you're stuck, it's just you!" These women had everything; Beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. If Little Edie had not been so hard for herself for the first time, things would not have worked out, lost her hair, her job, and the love of her life if she had. It's somehow related to what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to get up in difficult times and see good times ahead. The world will never know what happened if it had not listened to her mother's request: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking and lovable, even in their extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary and their dealings with each other brings humor and sadness with them. When Edie had one of her emotional failures, thinking about what might have been or how she would like to go out of her home because she feels like a little girl, you get a strong urge to hug her and tell her that "everything will be fine!" <br /> <br /> Great documentary! <br /> <br /> 9/10
