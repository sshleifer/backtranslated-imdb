I work at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunch break companion - good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia for the show days of Dick van Dyke. How innocent we all were (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder). I especially enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia characters like Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys go on. The stars obviously have fun and have a ball without being too serious. <br/> <br /> A cow: Why were so many bad guys women or at least bitches? Amanda was too dizzy. It is hard to imagine that she is really doing something as cruel as an autopsy. I hope we have not seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, in particular. Noon !!
