I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was in the office over the weekend and the TV was running for background noise. But gradually I found myself more and more engaged in this film, of which I had never heard or heard, until I was fully absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is adorable, captivating, bizarre and moving - all in one superbly written, well made and perfectly directed package. It's a classic that really stands tall with Casablanca. It's a wonderful life, gone with the wind, Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same notice and prominence of the video rental? Fortunately, some knowledgeable critics have put it on their "Top 100 All Time" lists. There is hope - the 1940 Fantasia was not a hit until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was an idiot at the box office, but made a hit on television. Buy, rent, watch, demand! You will not be disappointed!
