Saw it as a young naive punk when it was first released. I had sniffed like a baby when I left the theater and tried to see no one. So when I saw it again in 2007, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and excited as their desired moment approached. Luckily I was at home this time. What I did not remember from my youthful view - or perhaps did not notice at all - was the technical brilliance of this film. The use of flashbacks that tell so much without resorting to dialogue. The camera work that seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene. Remember the opening when Joe crossed the street to the diner. The camera pans behind the woman and child sitting on a bench in the foreground and framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - shabby, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to be involved in a human drama like this with people who most of us would probably reject. On the other hand, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I remember when I left the theater I had to find the company of friends. All those years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a damn good movie.
