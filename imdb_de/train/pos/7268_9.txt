With everything that goes on in the world, sometimes we need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. No complicated action or deep meaning; but it is not insubstantial. There are more than angry action or heartbeat dramas. There are charming little shows that you can see with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date. Try it, you may like it more than you think. The little girl is really smart and sweet. The "Dad" and the girl go through some slapstick routines. When a jealous friend comes in, the trouble for Curly seethes and the life you know can be torn apart. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch are playing good roles, as the upper crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable, like a duo playing homeless drifters on the street. Their worlds collide and it is followed by a comedy.
