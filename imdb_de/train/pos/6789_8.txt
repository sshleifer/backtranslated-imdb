Legend of Dragoon is one of the little-known games that people either love or hate. Some people claim that it is much too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable since it was originally intended as Sony's equivalent of Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not comment on the similarities because I'm not very familiar with the FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the combat system. Not only do you have the ability to transform into a more powerful dragoon shape, but every time you attack, you must make sure that the attack is completed at the right time by pressing the buttons. Not only that, sometimes enemies fall back in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different keys to avoid being harmed. Even the use of certain attack elements requires a touch of a button. If you do not want to attack, you can always keep watch, which not only halves the damage taken, but also increases the hangouts without any healing potions. <br /> <br /> The FMVs are pretty good. done, about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, the graphics during the game does not meet this standard. They are nice, but they could have been better. The translation leaves something to be desired. Not only does it raise interesting questions about the character relationship, there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply were not allowed to happen. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found interesting was that you lose key character traits. one dies, and the other is basically useless for the party and leaves. While the death of one character is often called meaningless, one realizes early on that the characters, while heroes, are still as mortal as the next human. The people who replace the lost characters simply get all the values, so the transitional game is playfully pretty smooth. Maybe my only complaint about the characters is Shana, the love interest of the main character. She is the epitome of the helpless woman who must be rescued, pitiful to the point of making a player scream in frustration. While you can use her in your group, she is incredibly weak - I do not even know what her dragons look like because I liked them so much that I never used them. In contrast, the figure Rose is probably my favorite female figure in every game. She is not a wimp, and some of her dragon magic is extremely useful. Meru is also quite strong, although he is sometimes an annoying talkative brat. <br /> <br /> The character designers, like most, were inclined to make the female characters look pretty and whatever, and they have not given much thought to the actual utility of the outfits. Seriously, no armor and most of your skin is not helpful in fighting monsters. But I will give them props, because there are women who serve as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can not say much about the plot, as I honestly did not think much about where to go next. I am not sure if this says anything about the plot itself or my style of play. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very enjoyable game. It has its shortcomings, but for me it was just the right balance when I had to think and just press buttons and kill monsters.
