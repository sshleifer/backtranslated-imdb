This movie has many strengths. It has one of the best horror casts outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, as well as leading man Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone steps, a crazy scientist, city dwellers who swim torches and chase vampires, a character of the type "Igor", a pretty girl, even a Buromach castle master. The soft-focus camera work is atmospheric and imaginative. There are even some good comic reliefs that spread well throughout the script. <br /> <br /> However, it's not really a monster movie because there's nothing supernatural in "Little Castle". The plot revolves around the generic mad scientist (nicely played by Atwill), who rates his work higher than human life. <br /> <br /> It's not a premium material, because the plot and the whole thing have a loud resolution, a painfully bad dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth taking a look if you like early black-and-white horror pictures.
