MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> Underrated little Stephen King shocker. It is by no means perfect, even if the limp performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there was still the poorly managed mystical elements of the story to deal with. The old Micmac burial place, Rachel's dying sister, and the Jacob-Marley-an-Victor-Pascow never really unite to form a coherent one, and the film feels confused and overcrowded. But few horror movies are really perfect, and what is lacking in other areas, makes up for it in his shock readiness. "Pet Sematary" is one of the most gruesome horror films lately with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of Zelda. It is politically incorrect, it is tasteless, it is unfounded - and yet we are loath to disgust in a way that "safer" horror films can never do. Add to that one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and the witty directing of Mary Lambert, and you have a most satisfying, scary movie - even with the hokey end. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.
