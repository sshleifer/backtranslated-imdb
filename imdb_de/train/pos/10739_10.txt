Amazing documentation. I've seen it a few times on original Airdate and on DVD over the last few years. I was shocked that even for the year 2002, when it was released, it was not nominated for the Oscar for Best Documentary. No other documentary comes even close. <br /> <br /> It was recently on TV for the fifth anniversary, but I ended up missing the added "Where are you now?" segment, unless I understand that Tony is now working The Hazmat unit , <br /> <br /> I saw some criticism of the documentary on the list. I can not see how that could have happened otherwise. They had less than 6 months to put this together and put it on the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother has not had any projects for four years. What have you done?
