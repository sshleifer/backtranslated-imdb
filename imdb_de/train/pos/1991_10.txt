Incredible as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for Best Picture - and it was the third musical to win the award within five years. The first was My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! but is this Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two films are compared to the remarkably robust Oliver! Fade wet noodles. The spectacle is great; the songs are great; The story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic, up-to-date, relevant to human experience, and unlike the bloated gangs of New York, Oliver! provides a portrayal of poverty in the 19th century in London, England, which arouses sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, notably Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful, offering powerful depictions of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
