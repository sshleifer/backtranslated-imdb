I do not think I'll ever understand the hatred for Renny Harlin. "The Hard 2" was cool and he gave the world "Cliffhanger", one of the most awesome action movies ever. Right, you little punks, cliffhanger rules, and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is visiting his old town when he is asked for help. A former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps rescue him on a mountain top. Walker apparently came back at an opportune time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Torture & Co. They've lost a lot of money they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, and they really want it back. <br /> <br /> Essentially, "Cliffhanger" is another "Die Hard" clone. Just swap the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza into the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, including scenes that highlight our hero's weaknesses and keep him mortal. Of course, this set-up is shredded soon enough, as Stallone's character avoids a large number of bullets with ease, and faces forward with multiple faces without any obvious side effects. Is not that what action movies are about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies out there. A showcase with great scenes and stunts. One of the first stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it retains its action-honesty. John Lithgow's main villain is entertaining and a bad guy. Probably one of the coolest main villains of all time. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely the best of Renny Harlin and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
