Finally, a film in which the audience advises to the end, what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will go towards destruction by the end of the movie. Hoffman is great as always and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he says because he really can not think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit out of his element, but he played the role well enough. Add to this mix Andy's wife, perfectly played by Marisa Tomei and cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addiction; and a father who finally finds out what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.
