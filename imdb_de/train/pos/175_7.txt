A pretty average movie, but a brave one by Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as an executive producer & starter. Although she is confirmed at the end, she is ready to portray herself as a dizzying bimbo. How many other A-list actresses have been dulled by this movie? Not many. Does that mean that the female butt can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen personality and undertakes projects in projects that others do not. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman would never be successful. A wonderful performer. Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung.
