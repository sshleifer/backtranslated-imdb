It's a funny business to check movies. If nowadays "internalized emotions" and "emotional distancing" are preferred to direct sentimentality, it must be difficult to stay true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon after completing the jury duties at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's kabei. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I dreamily saw people strolling out of the theater hall, wet with tears, men, women and reviewers. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously a hardened onlooker of the cinema, confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three-quarters into this shameless sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> What really surprised me were the reviews came after. Although the film was indescribably moved, many reviewers opted for lukewarm and emotionally noncommittal. Apparently, after weeping, they had put on their "cap" and missed with what I thought was the genius of Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain that. <br /> <br /> In pre-war Japan, Kabei's story is about a writer's family and their fate after being held in jail for "imaginary crimes" against the imperial will. Through a series of lengthy emotional scenes, Yamada introduces us to the man, his faithful wife and two daughters, and three minor characters: the man's handsome young sister, a hobbling ex-student, and an uncle's buddy. ? Everyone comes to help the family cope with their distress, without the man of the house. <br /> <br /> The story goes on at a slow but steady pace, and heartbreak occurs at the very moments when everyone is able to predict. This, of course, makes it nearly impossible for anyone in the audience to be too dramatically disturbed by a dramatic event.

Everything you have assumed what the story was about? An innocent man who broke away from his faithful wife and daughters? Now suddenly points to one of the family helpers. Someone whom you have taken for granted is getting into an unexpected turn of fate. <br /> <br /> At that point, something strange happened in the theater where I was. Everyone began to sob with little or no inhibition. <Br /> <br /> "My word!" I mumbled under my breath. It then struck me that "kabei" was ultimately more than a movie about a family torn apart by a marginalized empire. It was indeed a sly investigation of a common human destiny: how little we care about the secret feelings of people closest to us. Now the most common criticism of the film was that it was technically sound but lacked in innovation. That happens when critics put on their proverbial hat, I think. I believe that Yoji Yamada knew with Kabei exactly which trick he would use to address a unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick he applied so seamlessly in the Tora-san series and later in Tasogare Sebei. After throwing the audience into a kind of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into a feeling rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the most effective cinematographic tool of all. One that avoids detection but deeply touches you. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet Kleenex pieces thrown into a garbage bin outside the thousand-seat cinema room. Now, if only a few reviewers refuse to be so smart that they forget what cinema is all about. Human feelings Pure and simple.
