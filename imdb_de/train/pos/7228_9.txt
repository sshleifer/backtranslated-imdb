The undisputed highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In return, wildly funny and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone make it better than O'Toole? I do not think what a great face the man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and in some places quite disturbing and emotionally intense (especially towards the end), but it also touches strangely and succeeds on many levels. However, I felt that the movie was essentially about Peter O'Toole's brilliant performance, and I'm sure I would not have liked it half as much if he had not been there.
