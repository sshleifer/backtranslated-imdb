I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I rummaged in the local Hastings because we had a craving to rent something we'd never seen before and stumbled upon this beautiful movie. We had no idea what it would be about, but it became spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the movie was made and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a fun movie that also makes you think, I strongly suggest you go quickly to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but that could ruin the movie for you, so I will not do it. This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. Do you really think that nothing is springy?
