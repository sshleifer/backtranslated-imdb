Bogdonovich's (mostly) unpublished classic is a film that is different from any other. A movie that feels like a fairy tale, but has a solid foundation because of the use of authentic Manhattan locations and the "true" geography in reality. Maybe the best shoot recording I've ever seen in New York. John Ritter reminds us that he can be brilliant with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) and that the entire ensemble is a group that you really want to have, so you can spend time with them , One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that does not seem to be a rip off for anything else. This is the culmination of Bogdanovich's fruitful career as his best work was done ("Saint Jack", "finally ...", "noises".
