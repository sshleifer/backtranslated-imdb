Jim Henson's Muppets have been my favorite since childhood. In this movie, I feel like a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they try to be in a music show on Broadway, where otherwise only in New York City. You will see cameos from the then New York Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the movie will be 25 years old this year, and I hope today's kids will appreciate the carefree nature of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is that Kermit has disappeared and the gang needs to find him in New York City. It's worth taking care of children and even sentimental adults like me.
