I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers of contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories that refer to a big scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest trouble in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILER) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood, the authority that blackmail against the normal population exerts, and continues to expect from theirs Efforts to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second play with a legacy of Italian Neorealism with a "Peter and the Wolf" -like anecdote. In the third story Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man who seems to be even more independent in context from this series. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible affair in the Mexican state, this story could not be more topical. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to dark humor The "grand finale" in which he puts most of the characters from the past sequences together to make one of the better comedy pieces ever made. Sariñana, who revisits the center scene from one of his earlier films "Todo el poder", gives the last lesson of the subject. By the way, give us the scene where Anna Ciochetti steals a short striptease. <br /> <br /> When the movie is over, you have a bittersweet feeling of having seen a good movie (and maybe.) enjoyed it with a very painful theme. They say that people in Mexico are laughing at their own shame, and this is the best example. This film is a testimony to how Mexicans have learned to live (and perhaps accept) in the middle of a crime state, between two fires: the criminals and the so-called corruption authorities. Even this movie is wishful thinking, because almost all good people have been victims of a crime and will not get it unhurt. If you had an attack without scratches, you're in luck. Do not miss the chance to see this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
