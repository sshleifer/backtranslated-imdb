YETI earns the 8-star rating because it's one of the biggest bad movies ever made. I saw it at a midnight screening in LA and people were shouting and cheering over the madness - this movie is one of those cinematic train accidents where you think you can not get a stranger and then not! The millionaire who is funding the project to thaw the Yeti looks as if Chris Penn and John Goodman were pouring into a badly fitting suit - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen are - and yes, there is a mute boy (who somehow looks like a girl) and is silent since he survived a plane crash that killed both parents (hmmm - maybe a therapy for the child?). Then this hot Italian girl is seen by Yeti (as soon as he thaws - what FOREVER lasts) - and he's instantly in love with her. One of the hysterical things in this movie is that this huge yeti makes "bedroom eyes". With her - it's like a big Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. Once the big yeti picks up the hottie and lays it against his chest, he inadvertently touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, the movie needs time to show his big gray nipple GET HARD !!!! Yikes from all YIKES! Add to that a collie dog, because the Italian producer must have heard that the American audience likes dogs and he somehow tried to get a Lassie - there is also this crazy scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - and keeps that big herringbone for yourself comb the hair of the Italian "Gee, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smell like dead trout. You're the best." This movie is more bizarre than anything Ed Wood could ever dream of. If you're a fan of classic cinema, look for this baby.
