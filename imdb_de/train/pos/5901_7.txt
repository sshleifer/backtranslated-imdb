It is a reissue of many new films, only this one has fewer stars, less complications and a fuzzy feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unknowingly) begins its process of being arranged. Within a short time, the two strangers are married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who make similar moves as they do. When they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and / or patched and flowers are loved. If you have seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you have seen this movie. The twists and turns of the plot are the same, in the entire two and a half hours of the film, there is no surprise. Everything is predictable. I only enjoyed it because earlier in the day I had seen "Darling" (also starring the leading actors Deol & Khan in the lead roles), and their chemistry was very pleasing in this regard. That's why I said, "Why not," when my sister suggested renting Just married. <br /> <br /> See it: Because Kirron Kher is a co-star and you're her favorite in it. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've had enough of the whole couple of nonsense! <br /> <br /> C +
