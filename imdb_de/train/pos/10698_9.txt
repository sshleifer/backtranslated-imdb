A little funny movie. It's absolutely incredible, incredible and impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can be totally dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows, but who can penetrate his fantasies. Of course it is a condemnation of the foolish offers that you can find on the internet. You must not believe ten percent of what you are told there and never accept to bind your hands in any way to any person or entity or organization that you do not personally know. Most of their "business" exists in one way or another to deceive you and plunder you. But here the guy deserves the victim of such gangsters, because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the movie becomes funny, because the victim of the crooked business has the upper hand and plays the same game with his victim and wins. A thought is sure too. Safety at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I think it's nowhere better in the world and even now they've tightened all the rules and regulations. Then they have their revenge by losing their luggage, a real scourge at modern airports and do not expect adequate compensation. Or even the seizure of a bottle opener or a can opener, as this can be dangerous. I can see myself cutting through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, right?
