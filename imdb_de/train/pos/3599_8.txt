This movie is a true gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives are absolutely believable. The dialogue is fresh and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and in no way clich√©d or fake. Until the climax. Then it's as if the movie was a bit out of joint and it became a bit hokey and unbelievable. But I do not want to stop people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 of them are really remarkable. I gave him an 8. Here are some noteworthy achievements. Watch this movie.
