Sudden Impact is a two-pronged story. Harry is targeted by the mob who wants to kill him, and Harry is very happy to be able to return the favor and show them how to do it. This little war puts Harry in suspension, which he does not care about, but he's going on a little vacation. Now the second part of the story. Someone kills some punks and Harry gets pulled into this situation where he meets Jennifer Spencer, a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet. The police chief is not a subtle man and warns Harry against interfering or making trouble. This is Harry Callahan Trouble following him. The mob haunts him in this city and hell opens when Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, the vigilante strikes again and the gang it has found is ready for them. Jennifer Spencer gets caught and Harry rescues her during the climax of the movie. The sudden impact is not the best Dirty Harry, but at the time it gives us a Harry who is an anti-hero who is ready to go to war just to pursue justice. Again not the best, not the worst, but the one with the most memorable line. Make your day.
