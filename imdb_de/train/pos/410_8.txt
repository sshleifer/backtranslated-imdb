I borrowed this movie in DVD form, without knowing it, part of a winter marathon, watching a movie every night. After several terrible American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors seemed like a brilliant original filmmaker. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the sincerity of the film, the warmth and the total absence of irony refreshing, and the movie looks spectacular. Of course, the special effects are not as technically flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are more interested in color, composition, and movement than in realism, and many of the shots are stunning. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on rugged crags, a huge moon rises in front of them, the picture is perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess warrior pulls herself behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking rocket through the sky. And the colors explode from shot to shot to express emotions instead of depicting reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and directness as comic characters and do not offer much depth in themselves, but are related to types of arches that resonate deeper. Physically, some of the actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles straight out, without irony or cunning, and are therefore credible. <br /> <br /> Strangest of all, despite the clumsiness of the conspiracy and the thin characterization, in the end I found myself close to tears, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the director's wildly original, kind-hearted vision. <br /> <br />
