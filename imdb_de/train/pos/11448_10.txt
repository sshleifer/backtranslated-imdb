I saw this absolutely mesmerizing documentary for the first time in its first release in 2001, and it had a profound effect on me, so much so that I got some of my friends to see me in rehearsal shows with me. Conclusion: None of my friends went away disappointed (ever!). This outstanding film is about the Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who uses natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create some absolutely beautiful works of art to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We see how Goldsworthy creates several temporary art works of art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as some pieces in nature. The German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process, which is a real treat for both the eye and the ear (with an ambient music score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is usually nervous experimental noise is textured guitar as well as a capable musician ensemble). Although this movie has been available on DVD for several years now, you should find a movie that highlights a revival of this beautiful movie. Definitely look for it (it's easily a movie composed for the big screen) a capable sound system to really get the movie right). No MPAA rating, but nothing to insult (unless the live birth of a sheep on the screen can be offended or disturbed)
