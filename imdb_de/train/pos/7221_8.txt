Every time you think you have Deathtrap under control, another twist comes. It is best to sit back and enjoy the ride with this one. Best known for his kiss on screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (who unfortunately was cut from the TV version I've seen), this movie has much more to recommend. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his last plays fell on Broadway. And though his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing more than supportive in a monetary and emotional sense, it does little to make Sidney feel better. The young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) has Sidney just a piece to look sent. It's Anderson's first and Sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer. He jokes with his wife that he should invite Anderson to him, kill him, and submit the play as his own. She laughs with him first, but when Sidney actually invites Anderson to dinner, she's worried he might really put his plans into action. And her fears can only be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant screenplay. There are twists and turns in the plot, and they get faster and more angry the closer you get to the end. It's the kind of movie where you sit on the edge of the seat right from the beginning and stay there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of tension and mystery. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is excellent. Caine gives his usual excellent performance and shows a flair for cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent portrayal of a man who is not nearly as far-flung or innocent as he seems. The rage of the cannons works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance as a curious neighbor, who is also a psychic. <br /> <br /> This is an end-to-end movie you would never expect, and repeated observations help you to recover things that were previously forgotten sightseeing. An unsung classic, which is unfortunately remembered only for a scene that has confused some sensations at the time - and that's a shame.
