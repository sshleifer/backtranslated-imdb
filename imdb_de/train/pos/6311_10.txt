This movie is very funny and has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy, who always play these kind of roles, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor, shows his comedians in Brothers Cohen's movie, "Oh brother, where are you?" which becomes one of my favorite movies ever! However, "Welcome to Collinwood" is hard to find here in Mexico. In my city, there are no good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy it from Blockbuster, but they do not know the original name, so maybe it's a bit easier to find out if I have the name they gave to me in Mexico. Does anyone know about it? can not remember cheers. ON.
