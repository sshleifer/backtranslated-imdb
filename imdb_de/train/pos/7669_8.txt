Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare movies that are totally under the radar, but worth it. It really reminds me of the old series of the 30s and 40s. That's why I would have liked to watch episodes ... But for the rest of Full Moon, there were not enough tits to satisfy the typical crowd. Unfortunately, thanks to a totally redundant sacrifice scene, two are too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them, this could have been a Harry Potter magical feast that would have eaten the children. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar had not wandered off an A-list image on this film, she was very credible. No seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they did not have the money to pay Dr. Strange because I think that this could have been a total childhood phenomenon.
