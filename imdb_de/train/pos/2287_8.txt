This movie has pleasantly surprised me. It's a touching, slightly out of the way approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I've never heard of. Great writing, producing and acting. I would recommend it to anyone who wants something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was not made from this movie anymore?
