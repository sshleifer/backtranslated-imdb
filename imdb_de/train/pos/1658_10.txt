If you've seen this movie, you've been in Puerto Rico. I have lived all my life in Puerto Rico and must shamelessly admit that we (PR) are experiencing real chaos right now. Drugs are the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone and everyone and many innocent lives have been lost. We no longer feel safe, and moreover, our so-called "justice" is no longer driven by truth and truth, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, deplorable facts and really represents the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related acts, money and power that manipulate our courtrooms. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their lifelong conspiracy and award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to portray it all as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country that lives a nightmare does not seem to end! !! ** You recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director of the World Cinema Competition at the "Phoenix Film Festival 2006".
