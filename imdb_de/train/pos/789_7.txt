Crush offers a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I find that the English are very well established when it comes to matters of the heart. Most notably known as a director, John McKay wrote this wonderful screenplay about thirty friends in a small town in England. All three professional women, who had no luck with men, formed a ritual women's night, in which gin, fags and sweets were recorded, in addition to endless rumors about their wrong behavior or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell, once again thrown out of the UK environment (where I find she radiates the most), is absolutely charming as head of the prestigious school, who deals with a younger man. Town Gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great side occupation) are in conflict with their relationship. To unfold a series of brutal, unfortunate events and show us the many difficulties in seeking true happiness. Remember that the main premise of this film is friendships and the end shows us just that. This is the kind of movie you either love or hate, which is why I believe that many mix reviews did not result in the greatest success this movie was released. I'm sure most of you just dug up the movie. I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it, for example "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a Funeral". Not to mention that the soundtrack is extraordinary and captures the crucial moments perfectly.
