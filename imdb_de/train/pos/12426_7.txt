David Duchovney creates a role he should mimic in californication - the restless talent. And it's a role he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and carries you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a nefarious doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and a craving for the sultry Jolie mix an intoxicating cocktail. Unfortunately, the story gets a little weaker in the end, and the relationships between the villains and the FBI are confused and hectic, as if they were created only to develop the final scene. But apart from that, a worth watching movie.
