Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an older man and on the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with marriage and the deprivation of love causes Eva to return to her father on a farm and leave her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse flees with her clothes and a young worker takes her back and gives her back to Eva. They fall in love and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to have Eva home. Eva refuses and luck brings the trio to the same place and tragically ends the affair. I've just seen "Extase" for the first time, and the first comment I've got relates to the awful quality of the VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Video Network in Brazil: the movie has a running time of only 75 minutes, and that seems to be different movie roles were used. Some parts are totally damaged and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the chance to find these rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very outdated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, as Hedy Lamarr shows the beautiful breasts and the naked fat body for today's beauty standards. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between Eve and her lover. The way the director directs the scenes to show the needs and deprivations of Eve is very clear. The inconclusive ending is also very unusual for a 1933 film. I liked this movie, but I hope someday to have the chance to see an 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
