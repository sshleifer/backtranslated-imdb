I was fortunate to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was so harsh with what I saw that I returned to his second of three performances the next night. A funny, wild and sharp attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment that has been passively swallowed without being beaten by the lowest-denominated target audience led by a loner-journalist who is slowly becoming members of his guerrilla war on predictability The film revolves around and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you will be left with renewed hope after the credits and are thrilled to be able to produce original films. Anyone who is frustrated with unfulfilled expectations of something that would lighten their imagination would do well to hunt down this barely seen object (and that's what I mean by hunting). For fans of the Fight Club and all Charlie Kaufman movies and anyone who avoids multiplexing like a rabid dog.
