I'm maybe one of the few who really stuck to this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was way ahead of its time. The humor in the movie itself is a pure MAD journal. I can not understand why MAD stands behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early '80s that had a soundtrack to the punk and new wave bands that were by L.A. at the time. I own the soundtrack and still play it consistently. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies. I do not think Porky's is as funny as Up The Academy, there are some really good laughs during the movie, and the jokes are either stereotypes or wrong. Hey, nobody said that this will be the Maltese Falcon.
