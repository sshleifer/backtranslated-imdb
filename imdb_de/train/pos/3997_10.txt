What a moving movie. I have a dear friend, who is in her sixties and has said in the last 15 years that people do not see her anymore, and she longs for camaraderie. I'm in my late forties and I'm starting to see what she's complaining about. They are no longer youthful, beautiful or touchable. If May says "... that body of a body ..." wow. How our body changes and how we are told is no longer beautiful. I love it when she starts changing what she wears ... the colorful scarf ... not the frumpy woman anymore. <br /> <br /> It is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sadly, this May betrays her daughter's confidence ... beautiful that she finds herself troubled by the difficulty of the affair and decides to move on and eventually lead her own life. I love that the character dares to initiate even the love affair. <br /> <br /> Mostly I love the movie because it shows a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships, whether they are family or not. We see Paula's vulnerability, but she will have whatever she wants at any cost ... (if she tells her mother that she will have a baby for Darren, whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if Darren wants a child at all)? The film shows how relationships can change, yet reveals what has always been quiet there. May stifled her own creativity to start a family. A family she did not really want, but "something you just did when she was young." I love the scene when Darren calls her an old cake and she smiles and says, "I've never been called that way". It really was a gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. I just love him. I was positively surprised. He is not only pleasant in the eyes, he is a true talent. What a nice role. He is much more than anyone else who is safe, and I look forward to seeing him in other roles of this kind. The scene in which he pleases May and the look he gives her is a kind of miracle that he has such control over this woman, and it's also a pleasure to give her that. He actually enjoys giving her pleasure. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is completely immersed in his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Oh ... I wonder, where is my Darren?
