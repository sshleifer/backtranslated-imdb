Previously I wrote that I loved "Titanic", cried at the end (often) and I'm a man in my 60s. I was also wondering why this awesome movie, which has won so many awards and been acclaimed by so many critics, received only a 7.0 rating from users of imdb.com. Well, I've seen the collapse of the user reviews. While 29.0% of all votes received a rating of 10, 10.7% gave a rating of 1. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users have downgraded the overall score to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I have blamed this very unusual voting pattern (sudden rise in valuations with a high rating of 10, which drops only gradually and then suddenly reverses and jumps to rating level 1). only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've set up enough chat rooms to see the jokes of young people (mostly young men) slandering him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in honoring "Titanic." (To answer another user: I'm NOT talking about someone who just does not really like the movie and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has their own taste and is entitled to it, but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of just 7.0 for "Titanic," which has been drawn to this level by an excessive number of ridiculous 1-ratings, is a reasonable reflection of the entire movie.) <br /> <br /> Let me Demonstrate my point of view by comparing Titanic's imdb user voting pattern with 5 random cash registers and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of the cinemas after a very poor box office and the voter numbers of the imdb voters were: 23.2% 10 and 9.2% 1 (overall rating 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.2). WHAT HAVE ALL THESE FILMS WITH "TITANIC"? All percentages of her 1 ratings are lower! AS "TITANIC" AND NONE THIS STINKER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE PRICE. "Titanic" received again 10.7% 1 Ratings! Compare that to the other 5 movies I've just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any explanation other than hatred of Leo? <br /> <br />
