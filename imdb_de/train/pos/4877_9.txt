Actually, a particular person / figure is not "right there", but my summary line refers to the strength of the movie. And all of this is achieved without fancy camera pans and / or large production sets, but with a great story and very (credible) and good actors, the story (the arc) convey accompanying great Japanese films / cinema (such as Tokyo Story, etc.) , of course not so much in the story, but rather atmospheric! Great spectacle, nuances in the performances that are truly jewels. If you want to experience a touching story and want to see a movie that touches you emotionally, then this is the movie for you. As you've noticed (as with many of my reviews), I can not go down in history. IMDb has places where you can look up. I am not one who spoils history!
