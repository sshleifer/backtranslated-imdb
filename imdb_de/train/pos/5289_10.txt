John Waters has made the most pushy, warm, dark, personal little movie I've ever seen (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women is about to finish) it's personal and strange reflections of the family and its own inner life ..

A grandmother with a talking Maria, tea bagging, recycled clothing, garbage of yesteryear is becoming the art of today - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is the family ... and a modest life ,
