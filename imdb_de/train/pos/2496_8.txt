No garbage - no, not even near garbage. No original? that's the last thing you could say about "2.4 kids." Predictable? certainly not! Although it was an unusual series for the BBC, it was funny, funny and funny. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard, whom I believe are wonderfully preformed. Gary Olsen was also very good and so were all other actors a relatively young age. I wish they would make more out of this kind of comedy, much more of them (and show them here in Israel).
