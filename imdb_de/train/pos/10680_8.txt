As is almost always the case, when Britain comes up with an entertaining and / or successful sit-com or quiz show, the Yanks will come along and drop the format and produce their own, grossly inferior version. Of course, Man About The House is no exception to this rule. The version of Yanks (Three's Company) was unsurpassed. Braindead Pap seems to be running forever. A prime example of quantity over (nonexistent) quality. The original, on the other hand, is a lovingly remembered gem that had the courage (just like Fawlty Towers) to pull the plug at just the right time (unlike the 637 episodes of "Hilarity" that Three's Company woke up with). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry between the Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made it all look so easy, the scripts, though not necessarily Oscar Wilde standard, were all funny and Chrissy was the most gorgeous gorgeous woman to run This planet since the Dead Sea just felt unwell. 'Nuff said.
