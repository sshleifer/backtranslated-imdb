I always wanted David Duchovney to get into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. This movie was what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well and managed to stay consistent with something new instead of playing Agent Molder, to whom we are accustomed. That's why I give him extra thanks for his role, also because I could not see anyone playing this particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that will not weary you throughout the movie, because it always surprises you. He has weaknesses and strengths that make the story all the more credible. I also enjoyed the story very much, she added a good deal to the story and had some very catchy quotes that I still use. This movie also had a wondrous score. I recommend it to anyone who likes drama and does not like blood.
