To prevent her gay boyfriend Albert (Perry King) from being pushed back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have a separate life when they fall to bed one night after Albert's birthday party and then fall in love with love. Later in the film, after falling in love, Stella suspects that he has cheated and turns up at night late at night. What she finds will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. Very controversial after its release in 1978, the movie rated "R" is now "PG" in this much more liberal era. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the DVD includes a "making of" segment on the peculiarities and it states that the film is based on an actual story, so viewers who viewed the film as " not genuine ", are wrong. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons - these are the topics that will be explored in this wonderful movie for anyone who has ever loved.
