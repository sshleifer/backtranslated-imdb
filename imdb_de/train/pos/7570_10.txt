I recently bought the very underrated Dreamcast and went to town to find some games to use on. I bought Soul Calibur (A Classic) and then went through the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and played Res Evil three times, and I was impressed by everyone, especially No.1, who has to go down in history, has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them comes close to the Dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory gameplay. When it comes to buying a Dreamcast for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort. I've never been so fascinated by a computer game as it fascinated me. <br /> <br /> However, the story continues from Story 2, in which Claire Redfield searches for her brother (Chris - 1st story), who is believed to be missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded corporation. Little is known about this company, except for the fact that you destroyed it three times in previous stories. If you assist Claire with Supergatt Steve's assistant, you must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris if you manage to get that far without running out of fear out of the room. <br /> <br /> The controls are very smooth and the movement of the characters is realistic when the character sees danger, he looks in the direction from which he comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I rated this game 10/10 because it's just the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world. Please buy this game as soon as possible.
