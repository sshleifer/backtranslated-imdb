A surprisingly good movie! It has some good jokes throughout the movie. The only negative is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, keep up the good work! <br /> <br /> The plot barely escapes and is called "stupid". And boobies are always a plus, though for some strange reason the movie does not play with this card, even though the plot features two black-haired women acting as the nasty antagonists of our two blondes. All in all a good movie to watch. I would have given it almost 8/10, but we do not want to go crazy.
