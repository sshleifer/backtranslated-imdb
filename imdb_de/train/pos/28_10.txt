And here is yet another proof that we should all adore the Italian Giallo and acknowledge that it is the most unique genre in horror. Emilio Miraglias "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" is an absolutely mesmerizing whole of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventive murder sequences. It's a fabulous Giallo (released in the golden year of 1972), one of the top 5 Italian cinema fans. The plot not only presents your average black-gloved and sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned vengeance with the macabre myth of the murderous "red queen". At a young age, her grandfather tells the ever-fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about an eerie woman who kills seven people every 100 years on April 6, of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, Kitty is the successful choreographer of a well-known modeling agency (she even shares her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the murder rush begins. Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she recently moved to the States ... Or does she? They're pelted with complex herds and red herring every few minutes, and the character of the Red Queen is definitely the most intriguing killer in Giallo history. Her face is never to be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and brings out the most terrible laugh when she makes a new victim. She is also not exactly meek, as her victims stabbed barbarously with a dagger, pulled behind cars and even impaled on fences! The latter is really one of the biggest (= cruelest) acts of violence I have ever seen! What more could you ask for? Maybe a stylish and tasteful nudity? The great actresses got more than just covered, including Barbara Bouchet and a young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous Giallo director because he only made this and the also recommended "The Night Evelyn came from the grave", but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten.
