Diagnosis Murder is one of the few programs that I now regularly watch on television. The way all the main characters in each episode have something to do differs from today's shows, where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is pushed aside. The functioning of Mark's brain is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you are doing what you do not do in the cases but in each of your personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> For the elderly? I'm 24!! I do not think that I can still be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can watch them all in the right order. They seem to be dealing with many other programs from the same time, so they can speed it up a bit!
