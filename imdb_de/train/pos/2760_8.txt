Everyone we meet affects our thinking, modifies our ways, a little bit of that person rubs off on us. "The eighth day" picks up on this topic (compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), an expert on sales psychology, meets Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a Down syndrome child on the run. The successful performances of these two actors give this film its strength. The opening sequence is excellent when Georges gets his theory about the creation of the world and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are a few moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely unrestrained, demands a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down Syndrome group fled on a bus to the Art Gallery and crashed Paradis Fun Park. The most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where Harry and Georges drive past a horse-drawn cart on the freeway, and when Georges looks back, he gives the driver a rude salute. But there are also a few gentle scenes, especially the impressive use of close-ups of hands - hands that feel the sun, wind and rain, grab hands, grab hands and get in love and friendship. This is a true cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes in which Georges Nathalie suggests, in which Georges weighs Harry's head in his arms, where Georges is constantly calling for his dear mother, in which Georges teaches Harry how to laugh - the presence of grass (Did you know that it's crying when you cut it off?), the trees above it, the birds singing, the little insects - all miracles of nature. They are all there to be enjoyed when we sit back (like Harry and Georges) and look around and hear ... A beautiful movie.
