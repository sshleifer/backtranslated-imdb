Tell me what you want from Andy Milligan - but if his family was even as disinclined as 10% like the one in this movie, then he could probably have gotten worse. Unfortunately, the video printing of this film contains sex scene inserts that were originally taken by the distributor to enhance the appeal of the image. Milligan's ugly camera and silent film music ends abruptly throughout the movie, and all of a sudden, handsome representatives of Milligan's homey actors enter the psychedelic 60s guitar rock. It's pretty easy to fast forward if you try to watch Milligan's original movie, which unfortunately misses a lot of action cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains is still convincing. I do not think I ever saw a hateful mother in a movie.
