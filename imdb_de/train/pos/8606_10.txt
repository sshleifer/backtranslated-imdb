It seems that there is no middle ground in this film! Most of it happens in a dream and, like most dreams, is often foolish and illogical. It's also a great production with great songs and good performances, especially from our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanettes Deadpan, ignorant insults and various other faux pas on the dream reception are funny and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a pleasure. Once she sings a section of Carmen, followed by the last trio Faust (for a strange reason with a pet dog) and then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - hugely entertaining if you can get into the groove.
