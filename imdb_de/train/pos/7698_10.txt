But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang comes first as a choreographer, only Sammo Hung is in his best shape. This is immediately apparent in his proud technical exhibition - rather than flashy camera angles, etc. - while fighting. The direction is strictly controlled to not only excite the viewer through the speed and movement, but to impress them with the precisely indicated skill. This film also benefits from Liu's involvement in front of the camera. Liu's appearance on the banquet scene that begins the film is one of the highlights of Kung Fu film history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (by My Young Aunt Glory) and 'Hsiao Hou', whose acrobatics are breathtaking and are preferable to a lot of tightrope work. but with character and moral development along the way and a highly appropriate solution. The humor is also the best. If you only see a kung fu movie, this is a good choice - it has everything.
