I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it scared me terribly. <br /> <br /> I would like to revisit this series and see if it was as good as I remember, though I suspect my tastes and my needs have changed this was released before alien and a wealth of other space thriller, I suspect that it has its roots in scary films of the 50s and the political climate of the 70s. When I think about it, this was a real science fiction, a film that tries to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term "science fiction" has since become bleak and becomes a household name for any movie containing spaceships.
