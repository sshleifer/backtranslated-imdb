This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant props, no chases, no clever one-liners. Only people who deal with people. William Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the obedient son, Sutherland is the domineering father. Son wants out of business, father does not let him. Macy loves his own son, who is beautifully played by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also falls in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters, and the movie follows the reluctant killer while keeping his own balance with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And as you would expect in a movie with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work, actor and director. Nice to know that with a small budget you can still make a good movie in Hollywood.
