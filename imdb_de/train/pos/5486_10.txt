Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It's so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor in his country is so belittled in the US. My worst "sin" in my opinion is the concern for those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about it? I have always been fascinated by the reaction of the US government and the media to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn companies in Cuba to the needs of the poor rather than the big cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and the government have such a problem with the poor? If these people are "dictators," we could use more "dictatorships," especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
