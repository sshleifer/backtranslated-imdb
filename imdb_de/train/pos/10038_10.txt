Titanic has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. It has its problems (which movies do not do), but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> When I stumble upon someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "Wait a minute, you." Not? I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I'm not saying that I do not see why. "The love story is too cheesy" well, but is not it pleasant and moving? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic. Everyone knows that such love does not really exist. But this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that makes us fantasize for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet, are terrible actors. OK, in this movie I agree that they do not reach their full potential. However, I find it unfair to say that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think both are very talented actors who are unfortunately very famous for a movie where they are not so great. But the roles they get are simple and the characters seem genuinely enough to be pretty much taken care of, but I agree with many people that they were not as good as you could have imagined. <br /> <br /> And finally, if you complain that you do not like this movie, because you hate romance, or because you hate stories or tragic movies, then I'm sorry, but why in the world World, they've been watching a movie that's so clearly all those things. It's like people who complain that The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Just to be a movie, not because you do not like the genre, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The Oscars, especially Best Cinematography I've earned, deserve to be seen in a movie, except perhaps the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that part of the writing fails, like the constant screaming of others' names throughout the movie. The flashback part of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing feat if the Titanic looks so real and the sinking feels so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like it In this movie, it usually comes down to them not liking the basic idea, for example, a love story, rather than thinking that the movie in and of itself is poorly built. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books on the Titanic, including memoirs on the day it happened, and this movie is historically accurate except for a few errors. The only thing I can find is that the tubes should be threaded with copper and not with steel. The iceberg looks pretty unrealistic, as does the scene in which it was hit. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding movie performance that scares the realistic adaptation of events.
