Some Spoilers If you're a big horror movie fan, you'll know that Halloween has paved the way for many Slasher movies. Often imitated, never copied, this movie is a real horror classic and definitely one of the scariest films ever made, if not the scariest. <br /> <br /> I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the show (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before I saw this one. That's how it worked. But I have to say that this blows away all others. It's really scary, and seeing Michael show up behind a bush or walk around in the dark makes you cool your back. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabbed a guy and leaned his head to one side. It's one of the scariest pictures in movie history. Later Slashers like Friday's 13th Movies were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than any F13 movie. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic. You could imagine a crazy guy like him killing people. I admit, this movie gave me nightmares after a few nights. <br /> <br /> What's great about this movie is that it does not rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It's too bad that the later films in the series were influenced by this film, because this is as good as an example of a spectacular Slasher movie.
