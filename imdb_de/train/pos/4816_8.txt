I really liked the movie. Surely the audience will want to know more, and there is really more to experience historically! <br /> <br /> Has the production team been tempted to dramatize excessively, especially during the shooting event? There is a ton of interesting accurate material that is hinted? Prince Albert's contribution to Britain and the Monarchy justifies a film in itself, but that was obviously not part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are particularly good, but I'm alone in this production (which, judging by the length of the tracks, was certainly not cheap), a British judge of historical etiquette wanted the Duchess of York addition? Did Princess Victoria really stuff a whole truffle / rissole (?) Into her mouth while she spoke with the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with his mouth full? <br /> <br /> Victoriain could never really be likeable in this movie or in her shoes. But the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, we liked a lot, so did the script really allow us to get to know them really well? I always felt like a completely freestanding, uninformed observer, much more than "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen". To be honest, I still could not take my eyes off the screen, unless it's some of the more advanced camera techniques that distract from time to time.
