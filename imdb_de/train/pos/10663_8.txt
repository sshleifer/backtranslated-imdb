Here is an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on a disc. The first movie - and believe me, the smaller of the two - is MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950), in which she is associated with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star vehicle, in which Gable as usual dominates the film with his screen presence. Here he plays a macho racer who gets bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyck and begins the fight of the sexes. Of course, they end up in a hurry after a short time and it comes to a predictable and enjoyable conclusion. A little bit of flair, but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it visible! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a wonderful and rather unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful little gem from a movie that has not yet dated a jota! Here, Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of her young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and secluded Mexican beach when a tragedy suddenly ensues. A rundown wooden pier collapses, holding Sullivan under a heavy pylon, and you know what? Yes, the tide comes in. With no soul in sight and unable to free himself, Stanwyck sets out by car to seek help. After some distance, the only help she can get is from an unscrupulous convict (Ralph Meeker), who, in return for his help, wants more from her than money or clothes ("I'll do anything to save my husband Does she or not? <br /> <br /> Meeker runs away with the picture of it! He makes a pretty brilliant performance! Once he gets into the movie, you just can not take his eyes off him! Surprisingly, he never did much of a film career in the glowing Brando style, though he made great appearances as an unappetizing, nefarious cavalry officer in the outstanding man / stewart western "Naked Spur" (1953) and one of the doomed French troops in Stanley Kubricks Powerful WW1 drama "Paths Of Glory" (1957) had the only claim to fame as Mike Hammer starred in Mickey Spillane's "Kiss Me Deadly" in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" was Have done wonders for him, but he only had such a great career in movies. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Due to this release, "Jeopardy" can now proudly occupy its rightful place as a classic Noir. A memorable, tight and thrilling thriller, thanks to good performances, tight-lipped John Sturges, crisp monochrome cinematography by Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin. The extras are not big shakes except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both movies. <br /> <br /> This CD is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck box celebrating its 100th anniversary. Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old, if she were still there! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - an MGM winner!
