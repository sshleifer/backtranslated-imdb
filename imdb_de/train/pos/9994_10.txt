"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and the white are always present in our lives. The performance of Mel Brooks is as always brilliant and the work of the other actors is also good. This movie has some Capra flair, that's why it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable gags, such as when Brooks tries to make money when he's dancing on the street, and all the people who pass by just ignore him, or if he's a funny, crazy one Man meets who believes he is Paul Getty, and then begins to argue and miss each other. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this movie and the reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and the reality does not have that. <br /> <br /> Yes, Life Stinks.
