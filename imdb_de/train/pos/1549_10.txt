There are movies and films. Films are mostly just cinematic "sweets," while movies are true works of art. Miss Doctor is certainly well placed in the latter. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the fight scenes, but the clumsiness of the central character's appearance is, in my opinion, the best quality of the movie. After she has done everything to serve her country as a true daughter of Germany, the Fraulein, despite the morphium addiction in the German Commander in Chief, despite all efforts very shabbily treated. The scene in which the doctor is transported in the backseat of a Mercedes Benz command car, alone, desolate and sobbing, is perhaps one of the saddest, but truest depictions of a "spy" slot in life. Only the emotional pain Richard Burton presented in the spy coming in from the cold comes close. Miss Doctor is a much deeper movie than you can tell from a single examination. My only wish is that its producers would find it appropriate to release it on DVD, so that those who have never experienced it and those who have seen it can enjoy (again and again) this extraordinary movie.
