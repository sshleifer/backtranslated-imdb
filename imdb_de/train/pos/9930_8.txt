I am totally surprised by some comments in this forum and many reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is very stylized, flashy and exaggerated, but it is very entertaining. I am glad that at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but if you like exaggerated, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, you should do it See it <br /> <br /> I already have Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies, but I like this more. It's like a roller coaster ride with a great selection of soundtracks and visual styles. At a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that someone is not afraid of nudity, bloody violence and explicit dialogue. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that Keira is very hot and even shows nipples, either ...
