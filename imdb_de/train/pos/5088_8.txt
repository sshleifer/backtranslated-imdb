I never had a clue when I saw the movie that he was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was a very good, successful movie of the late '90s. But after watching the internet for TV, I was shocked because it's absolutely awesome for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that worried me most was the length. I felt that the single combat scene should have been removed as it was completely unnecessary. It also began to draw towards the end, as if the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side there is a strong, very interesting and captivating storyline with great performances by all. I just had the feeling that Patrik Frayze looked a little bit haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who was denigrated, got a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled with the beautiful landscapes of Africa. The first half of the movie would have forced me to give this movie a 9. Still, it's a great movie for the TV. 8 out of 10.
