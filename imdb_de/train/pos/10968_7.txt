Gray Gardens was fascinating and crazy and you just could not look the other way. It was so strange and funny and sad and sick and ?????? .. really can not describe words. The move Gray Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out that this movie had read my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, from the Bathroom Reader's Institute, and it was worth borrowing it and getting to the top of my queue. This movie is about the craziest eccentric people ever made. You should look for your favorite Edie outfits, which I can safely include curtains. When I'm old, I almost want to be like Big Edie and nose my nose about normalcy and company.
