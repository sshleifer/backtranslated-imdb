Let's start this review with a positive note - I'm very glad that they did not decide to shoot Tony and do a retrospective, as some people said. Actually, David Chase, creator and author of this episode, did exactly the opposite. We do not really know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very low. This episode seemed to be moving very slowly, and the coma-induced dream in which Tony had involved false identity and the Asian monks slapping him out of the hand was absolutely funny. After 45 minutes, I was a bit tired of all who were grieving, but that should not be a reason to beat this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco did an astonishing feat in this episode that shaped her career as the conflicting woman who faced the death of her husband. I also found it interesting that AJ broke up the school and swore a vendetta against Junior. Silvio is now an acting chief who opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes. There were also a lot of great quips in this episode, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore could succumb to his death if he's a greedy SOB. <br /> <br /> This was not a great episode and disappointed just because Tony kills people, we worship him as a spectator and we feel like the hero of the show. This was a necessary episode for the series, though it was a bit of snoring that brought it to a close. Kudos to Edie Falco's performance and David Chase and the writers who created this totally original and unpredictable watershed moment. This is the only season of "The Sopranos" where I have no idea where to go. I can not wait for the episode next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best line of episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
