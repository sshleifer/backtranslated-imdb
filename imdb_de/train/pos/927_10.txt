"Father of the Pride" was another good show, which unfortunately does not have a very long life. And that's pretty sad, especially considering that the worst shows are still almost on air (think "The Simple Life"). I admit that there are many similarities with this show and The Simpsons, but despite the similarities, the show has its own merits. The animation is just adequate, not unbelievable, but good. The best are the characters. All animals are very sympathetic and funny, and Sigfried and Roy had their moments as well. The music was good, I liked many of the songs. <br /> <br /> Although the show is not original, I think it had a lot of potential. Like "Mission Hill" a show that is not so very famous, but I liked it a lot, this did not have the appreciation it deserved. Too bad .
