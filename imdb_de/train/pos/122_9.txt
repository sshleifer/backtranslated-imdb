I had begun to lose faith in movies recently flooded with the typical genre Hollywood movie. Story lines fail, and the camera work is merely copied from the last film of similar taste. Then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical action is not only fascinating, but also the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max von Sydow) leads you step by step through a fascinating journey and enchants you with Europe in 1945. We have all seen death brought to the canvas in hundreds of thousands of ways, but the beauty of this film is like it go through any slow moment that leads you to death. Unlike many other films, it does not cut short after a second (for example) of a knife, but forces you to see the devastating but sensual beauty of a man's last moments. I think we can all take something of what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth taking the time to find out what it really means. I would like to talk more about the movie for anyone who wants to send me an e-mail. Enjoy it!
