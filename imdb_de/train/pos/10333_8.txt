This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly debated about the atrocities of the Nazis before the full extent of the extermination camps was revealed. During the end of 1944 and until 1945, they revealed how evil and terrible they were, and unlike other Hollywood films, this film is the most brutal and honest film of the epoch I've ever seen in terms of Nazi atrocities Future in a courtroom - after the war is over (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). At this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is completely uninteresting and there are successively called witnesses who reveal Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first glance, the film seems to be sympathetic or to explain how Grimm was urged to join the Nazis. After a while, however, it becomes clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and make the movie less like a propaganda, but a legitimate drama. All in all, the film does a great job, considering the movie's first class stars. There are many captivating scenes and performances - especially the very premature Jewish extermination scene at the end, which can not help but bring tears. It was also interesting how there were some super-creative scenes in the same place in the movie where crosses were used in a way that you would not notice at first glance. All in all, it's a must for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> FYI - This is not a serious criticism of the movie, but Hitler was called "this paper hanger". This is an indication of the myth that Hitler once made money while putting up wallpapers. This is indeed NOT true - he used to be a "starving artist", a homeless person, and served well in the German army during World War I. A terrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!
