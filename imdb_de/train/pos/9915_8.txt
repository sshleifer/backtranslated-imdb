I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I probably would have missed this movie if I had not chosen Air Canada. Seen on a small screen on the back of the front seat, I found that fascinating and fascinating. I drifted in some places and had to go back, but I had to watch until the end. Now I am looking forward to the DVD release in Europe, but if I am so fixated, if I can go out the door is not discovered yet! The film gives so much insight and "fills in" the story that the photos tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time).
