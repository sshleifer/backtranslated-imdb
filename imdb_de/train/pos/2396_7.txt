This is a very entertaining film that follows the replay process of a NY production by Macbeth. Although it says a lot about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the movie works best if it does not take itself too seriously. Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury are doing good jobs in the lead roles, but the highlight for me was the funny scene in which the "murder" of Banquo (John Elsen) is recorded. Probably a more entertaining movie for theater lovers, but who likes Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
