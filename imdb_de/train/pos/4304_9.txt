I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7 years old. and then it shocked me. I had previously seen a violent film, but never a movie with the consequences and the reality of violence. This film not only shows that, but also shows how people can change their lives and decide happiness. What this movie did and the crash failed was to be honest. Crash tried to show how bad racism was (and Crash actually had an anti-Asian prejudice) and came from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon came from such raw and real perspective that it actually lands on a higher level than the crash. Especially if you compare the ends. The end of the crash is this supposedly neat little end that holds everything together. The Grand Canyon simply ends with a quiet touch, where you know that not much will change in the character's life. No matter how good ... bad you are. There is no end of one chapter to start another.
