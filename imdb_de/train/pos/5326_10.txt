"Birth of the Beatles," an American television movie released in the fall of 1979, was actually the best movie to date, telling the story of the four Liverpool boys who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As said from the perspective of former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but above all the performance of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Anyone who had produced another TV movie a year earlier in 1978 proved the time with "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role of another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" who later shot other successful films as well. "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same applies to the director of the "Beatles Birth", Richard Marquand. He went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story of the Fab Four that I know of is Back Beat, released in 1994 as a theatrical release. However, the critics did not care about it, even the audience, because it had no long life in the theater. Birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simple film that teaches you the basics of the beginning of the legend and the struggles and hardships that you have gone through. It ends there when they arrive in New York and appear on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. I highly recommend this film.
