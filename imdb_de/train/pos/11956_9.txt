I'd even say a few shades of Hitchcock ... that's clearly better than MMM, which some, if not most, Woody fans consider guilty pleasure. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody gets some relevance in the movie comedy. The plot changes are nice and close. I'll say that some of the actors in the first 20 minutes are a bit too hasty to bring their lines, but they stay there. Scarlett Johansson is well-placed in the role of Diane Keaton, and there are never any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
