"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most underrated Slasher movie of the 1980s. It is one of the few films in this genre that fascinates throughout. Apart from that, it also depends heavily on the standard Slasher formula: a group of young men and women are cruelly killed until the last showdown. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" stands out about most points Movies in their genre is that it surpasses more. Marty, the killer, has a good reason against his former classmates. They electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's dressing room, thrusting a spear into his crotch, and, as a coronation, manipulated his experiment in the science laboratory to disfigure him. The victims in this movie are as unlikely as you get. When they reunited years later - with a high school reunification created by Marty himself - you realize that they are not mature yet. You are a bunch of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It's amazing why they would not be surprised why they were the only ones who came for reunification, which incidentally takes place in a school that has since expired. And who would think it would be a good idea to drink beer and spirits found in an abandoned building in a room where their old lockers - like Marty's - are on display? There are many leaps in faith that the viewer has to make to enjoy this movie. The end makes little or no sense. And the scriptwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool works: the film claims that pranks are not allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is one of the best examples of the Slasher genre. despite all the shortcomings. It is hard to understand why it has not found a way to DVD when so many other normal slasher hits are decorated with special editions.
