Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" has achieved a classic status through a timeless story and superb performance, notably by Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her O-Lan performance. Rainer's performance is so complete that it is almost unrecognizable. Rainer has very little dialogue throughout the movie (and it's a long one), relying instead on facial and body language. It works and works in such a way that anyone unfamiliar with their work can easily misunderstand them as such. The film remains current today because it explores the rags, the history of wealth and the related universal issues. When Lung and Mrs. O-Lan finally achieve their financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions, but without meaning. Only when they return to Earth after fighting a swarm of locusts (the special effects that created them are still unbelievable and beautiful to look at) will they find fulfillment again. A common formula narrated with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the movie a classic. Without friends and family, money is worth nothing. A point where the movie goes home perfectly in the last 10 minutes, with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion.
