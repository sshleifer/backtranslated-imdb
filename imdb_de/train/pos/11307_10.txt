In order to get in touch with the beauty of this film, pay particular attention to the soundtrack, not just to the music, but also to the way in which all tones influence the imagery. How beautifully does the opening scene that led to the expulsion of Gino create the theme of moral ambiguity! Notice the way music introduces the characters as we are led into Giovanna's marriage. Do not expect to find much here in the political life of Italy in 1943. That's not what it is about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of pictures and sounds, you are led into a word that goes beyond neorealism. At the end of the film, there are moments of the Antonioni-like landscape, which have more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite films by Visconti.
