This best performance from the social realism period of Georg Wilhelm Pabst is based on a tragedy in early 1906, when nearly 1,100 French miners died when a coal dust explosion took place at the Courrieres mine in northern France, after a fire had ended after three weeks Eventually, deadly mine gas was released which caused the casualties. The esteemed designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate tragedy and offer a perception of reality complemented by unparalleled sound editing. The only music produced by integral orchestras at the beginning and end of a work for which acoustic effects are equally important are the fascinating visual compositions of the outstanding director. Pabst's "Invisible Editing," in which the action varies from shot to shot through players' movements, has been smoothly integrated into this film, which also features sublime cinematography with vehicle-mounted cameras that allow the director to perform to move in scenes without this being necessary cutting. Although the main theme of the work refers to socialist dogmas, the unforgettable power of this film is preserved in detail. Pabst has set himself the goal of interweaving numerous storylines into a cinema wallpaper that admires the German rescue squads whose homeland is very proud and at the same time desperate about the catastrophic losses to the families of the French victims; certainly a groundbreaking triumph that is today stimulating a visit to the cinema, as it was at the time of its first release.
