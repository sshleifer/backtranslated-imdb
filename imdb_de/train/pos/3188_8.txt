I just had the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled upon this cute movie, looked at it, and now I'm ready to kiss a street lamp. I have to admit, I only saw him for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. But it really is so much more. The plot is actually pretty smart and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its adorable misunderstandings. And of course there are ... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I acquired (Mill Creek Entertainment's "100 Family Classics" collection) does not have the best video quality, and I have the same over heard the alpha release. The brightness and the contrast are a bit too high, so that many scenes appear bleached, especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suspect you can balance something with the controls on your TV. I can only imagine what it looked like on '51 'on the big screen. The sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and delightfully scary - sort of a "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". <br /> <br /> As for romance, this is just perfect. Not juicy, not invented, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Pity you poor fellows, your wretched life will never be as sexy as this one. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life is as bad as yours. My goodness. Time to take a look at this movie again.
