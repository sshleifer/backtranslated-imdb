Overall, Sudden Impact was better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was a great movie, but then I saw the villains and was disappointed. Sudden Impact was different than the previous installments. The plot was in a different direction in this film, as Dirty Harry is not being targeted by the police this time. We also see the villains later, which means less time for them, which is better for all of us. Clint Eastwood steals the show again as Dirty Harry. Pat Hingle was a pleasure as Chief Jannings, Harry's new commissioned boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs, no matter what he looked like. Michael Currie is decent as Lt. Donnelly, Harry's annoying boss. Personally, I enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was honored as Horace, Harry's buddy. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian in town. Jack Thibeau was a good Kruger, a pervert. Now for the worst part. Sandra Locke, longtime mistress of Eastwood, was a terrible misstep as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just as awful as Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been so much better had it not been written and acted better in some parts.
