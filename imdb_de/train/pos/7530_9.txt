This is a sequel to Batman the Animated, so to speak, and it's pretty much as good as it is and for the same reasons, it has a lot of action in it. The story is good. The spokespeople are really good as Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker etc. The bad guys are really good like The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, Clayface etc. Therefore, I'm sure you will not be happy with the new adventures of Batman will be disappointed because it is really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: *********** from ****** ***** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
