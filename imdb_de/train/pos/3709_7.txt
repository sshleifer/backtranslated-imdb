Any screen adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a mainstream approach in Hollywood, and Robert Altman is the last director I'd take on anything for a mainstream setting. But this south fried pot kettle is pretty good. It's not among the best of Altman, but it's certainly not among the films he has made that cause you to scratch your head and wonder what he thought earlier in his movie "The Long Goodbye". (1973). "The Gingerbread Man" is not nearly as good as the movie, but it does hold up pretty well. Kenneth Branagh is a moody lawyer who framed himself for murder after becoming involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz) who was asked to help protect her from her cuckoo's father (Robert Duvall). The film takes place in Savannah, Georgia, during a tropical storm that gives the movie a depressing atmosphere that I really liked. The twists and turns toward the end of the movie are getting chunkier and clunkier, and Altman proves he's not too skilled at shootouts, but overall, the film is not a bad match for Altman's canons Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah , Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Note: B
