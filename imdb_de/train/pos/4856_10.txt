I saw this movie for the first time years ago and watched it several times a year when I had the opportunity. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some classics. Should anyone tell you that it is stupid or outdated, ignore it ... This movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. Dancing is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so comedy and acting shine through. Watch this movie if you can, it can be light, but it's still totally amusing. I know that many people hate black and white movies, they think that old movies can not be really funny. This movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without at least mildly enjoying themselves. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He may be a great performer and capable singer, but he's just not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy sometimes gets a bit clich√©, but the gaude and G Allen vaudevillesque performances are just perfect for the play and can satisfy anyone looking for a light laugh. Give this movie a chance, even if you do not like old movies. This film can address the ridiculous in every movie.
