Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed "Phone Booth," '02, and many other great films, showed in great detail how no one can really be trained to be a killing machine without bothering to destroy his own personalities and the real fears of a person if you go into COMBAT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", '03, did one of his best and actually wore the entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", '02 gave a great supporting role, and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All The Real Girls," '03, showed his true acting skills in the role he played played. There were two short scenes in which the soldiers could find a hot romance during a short vacation in the city and pay for their love and sexual desires. A soldier from Vietnam, an army veteran, told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical cables in the wrong places of a male body. Pleasant and entertaining movie to watch.
