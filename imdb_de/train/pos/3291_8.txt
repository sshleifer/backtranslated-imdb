This is a great movie and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of home circles and students staying up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel 4. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but very effective, the blur between childish fantasy and hard nightmare is very blurry. The budget looks quite low, but does not show up too often. It's not dated that much either. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to film this from TV a few years ago when it was filmed a few years ago, and it has withstood half a dozen tours. It's one of those films that will not appeal to everyone; But as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would benefit a lot. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke performs well, as Anna, the spoiled brat, and it's a shame she seems to have gone off the drama scene. Cross is also very good and carries the size of his character very well in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are some really (and I say not so lightly) disturbing moments of half-second shockers and tedious tensions. Make sure the lights go out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
