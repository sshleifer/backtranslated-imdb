But it's worth it for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene Entertainments, filmed during the war, required either transplanting them to American shores, such as This Gun for Hire, or employing American actors in roles they did not suit. Bacall fits here. I've always waited for her to whistle and bring bogie to life; Her tone is simply wrong for an Englishwoman of the upper class. But stop the dialogue! No, people do not talk like that except in books, but Greene sent a message about an England that needed to be aware of the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's character collection was retained as a whole. While Mr. Mukerjee was more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality was maintained, and his last conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
