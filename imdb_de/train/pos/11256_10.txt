Undoubtedly the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus 'Czech secret service), Ray McAnally (Magnus Con-Man-Father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' Mentor) (Believer and British controller) are so perfect and natural along with the rest of the characters that the person responsible for the casting would receive a prize. Even the small parts like Major Membury are perfectly executed. For the power of performance and the strength of the characters in the novel, much is said that in spite of the duplicity of Magnus, one must be able to feel closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of US Intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times and seen the movie almost as often and am still fascinated by both. If I were to take a book on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice ahead of everyone else.
