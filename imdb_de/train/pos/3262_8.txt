I do not think I would have enjoyed it any more, though certain things were disturbing. I will not say what, if you have not seen it ... you have to find out for yourself. Which movie can definitely miss the eyes of Robert Downey Jr.? All in all, the plot was sufficiently developed. Nothing seemed to be too hectic, since movies like this tend to be. The characters were good-natured and there were many funny scenes in it. The idea is that the story is very well connected, though certain aspects may be unsatisfactory ... from the point of view of opinion. But like I said, it's hard not to love a movie with Robert Downey Jr.
