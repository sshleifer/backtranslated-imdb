Me and my sister saw the premiere last night. It was so good that we were stuck for the whole thing. Hahaha ... I think I'm addicted to the season. They have really good actors this thing ... the head coach and the player who likes Pete were very good and the action caught me already, but I do not really understand how they will hold it for a whole season I can not wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy Sumpter Who is he? I can tell him that he will be big !! He was so good that we immediately fell in love with his character. I can not wait until the next episode. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
