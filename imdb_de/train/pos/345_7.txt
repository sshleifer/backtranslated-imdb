The first hour of the movie was usually boring, to say the least. After the start of the Valentine's party, however, the situation improved afterwards. Apart from the twist on the killer's identity in the end, the hot bathrobe scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene in the garden with Kate was well received and so was the last scene (the "Twist"). There was some real thrill and thrill in these scenes, and the hot bathing scene scene was unpleasant (just as Slashers should be). The earlier murders are frustrating without gore.
