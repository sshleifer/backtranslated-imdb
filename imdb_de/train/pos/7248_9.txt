When I saw the exterminators from the year 3000 for the first time, I had no expectations for this film. Although it was not that bad, I thought. It's a sort of Italian version of Roadwarrior with cast, which is almost famed in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story are Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the history of zombie meat eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see this child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the living dead AKA Gates of Hell) as John Robbins and in the Cannibal Apocalypse as the role of Mary's brother. Very entertaining movie with a few boring spots.
