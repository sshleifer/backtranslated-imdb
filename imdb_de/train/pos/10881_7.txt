"Cut" is a parody of the Slasher genre that essentially does what it's up to. Most standard Slasher clich√©s are there; the old spooky house, the woods, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, the buckets of blood and of course the couple the killer interrupts in sex (that's hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set-up is simplicity: the film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished Slasher "masterpiece" that is unfinished due to the assassination of some cast members. This too neat - okay, messy - features Kylie Minogue in the first role. You will be accompanied by one of the survivors of the original movie played by Molly Ringwald who steals the movie absolutely because she gets the best lines. The rest of the cast went well with their roles, especially pretty Jessica Napier, who is playing it while chaos and blood erupt around her. <br /> <br /> There are many red herrings and fake thrilling moments. It's very little time to find out who the killer is because the movie moves so fast. It also has a reasonable low-budget look, including some awkward edits that are probably intentional. Good soundtrack. If there are difficulties with this film, he decides whether it is a broadcast or a tribute to the Slasher genre. Probably a little bit of both.
