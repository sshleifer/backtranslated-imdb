After Chicago I lost the respect for Richard Gere and then came The Flock. There's a nice smile so far and you can catch some casual facial gestures, but he has proven to me that he has finally got his craft and can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also great as a "trainee". Some have suggested there is too much unnecessary violence, but I do not think so. Nothing I saw affected the power of this movie. I was really shocked that I had not heard that it was released in the cinemas and instead found out about it at Blockbuster. Really an extraordinary movie with just the right mix of action, excitement, thrills and social awareness. As good as Seven? Perhaps. And you'll see how to act better on Gere than anyone ever got out of Pitt.
