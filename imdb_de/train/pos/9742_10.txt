This outstanding Argentine independent film is one of the best in 2000 from all over South America, including Argentina, which has been producing amazingly high quality films since 1999. In 2000 alone, Argentina published many quality films, the Argentinian B.O. broke. Records. Half a dozen have won international awards at major film festivals around the world. After watching this film, you can see how native Argentine films recaptured 20% of their national film market last year. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of Argentina's best directors, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization worldwide, but highlights its impact on Argentina, and in particular on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the nice Jewish boy who tries to survive in today's business climate and even succeed. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Hispanic cinema worldwide, is just as well suited as Simon, the Jewish father, as well as the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. So many current issues in urban western societies are explored, I do not have enough room to go into detail. Daniel Burman cleverly inserts them into the storyline, with different characters embodying different dilemmas. If this movie is played at a festival near you or on video, do not miss it!
