I think this movie is a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4-5 times to see it to see what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of World War II that we do not normally see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are portrayed as more "humanized". One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention of a murder that has taken place in a forest over the past 20 years. In these woods Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details is the appearance of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes people make when they walk over a door or open a door. Many doors are displayed on the screen, opened and closed. And the characters always change in their personality, in their actions, etc. Did you notice that?
