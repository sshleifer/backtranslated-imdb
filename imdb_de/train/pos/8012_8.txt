However, as far as the Muppet line is concerned, this is neither the best nor the second best. This has been marketed for the little ones but has some dark and emotionally exciting moments for adults that parents may not want to expose their children to. One of them shows Miss Piggy, who is in a jealous rage "post", which essentially lasts throughout the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story is progressive and extremely entertaining. A scene where Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go insane in a department store is just funny! And there are other parts of this work that involve the same level of ease and fun. <br /> <br /> I like it very much and still enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It is rated at 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
