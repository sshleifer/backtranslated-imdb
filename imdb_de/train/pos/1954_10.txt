I thought that this movie was doing really well. It was not as creative or original as the first, but who expected it. There was a lot of fun. The more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it appears on DVD, I'll be very proud to pay the money, every last penny. Sharon Stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not the case. This is one of those movies that is underestimated for his entire life, and is likely to become a classic in 20 years. Do not wait for it to be a classic. Take a look now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece or something that is captivating and touching, just let yourself out of your life and get involved in it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is entertaining and I recommend people who have not seen it, see it, because what the critics and box office say does not always count. See for yourself, you never know, you just like it. I give my hat to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
