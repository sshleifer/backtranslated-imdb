"One-Round" Jack Sander states that because he is a carnival boxer who fights against every man in the audience. If they can survive a round, they win a prize - a popular way to get clients into travershows. Jack is in love with the ticket girl Mabel, although her head is turned quickly as Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one knows in combat is that Bob is the champion, so he can beat Jack - though he needs some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the Carnival class. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly he works his way up the ladder until he's almost ready to accept the champ. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the champ and Mabel are running around behind Jack's back - although Mabel has since married, Jack. When the last fight between Jack and Bob takes place, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will Bob help with his legitimate anger or interfere with his performance? Agree and see. <br /> <br /> This film was staged by Alfred Hitchcock. While this film seems strange to a director known for mystery-suspense movies today, Hitchcock did not have a fixed genre in the 1920s, he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). In many ways, this film is more of a reference to Hitchcock's quiet style than a somewhat similar conspiracy in one of his next silent films, THE MANXMAN (which also features Carl Brisson as the unlucky husband). Although this resembles a normal boxing movie of the day, for this great director it was not a radical departure - even with its rather formulaic ending. <br /> <br /> Overall somewhat predictable and when Ian Hunter plays a boxing champ, it seems stupid that the movie works well. Although it's not a perfect silence, it's worth it to see it and bring a nice punch.
