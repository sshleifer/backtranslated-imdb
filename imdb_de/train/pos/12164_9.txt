In a year of pretentious filth like "Synecdoche, New York", a movie born of the purchase of Charlie Kaufman, comes a movie that is similarly hard to see, but about three times as important. "Frownland" is a love work by the crew, the actor and the filmmaker who has been filmed by friends for years. It traces a man who can not communicate through his absolutely authentic, real Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step ahead of the styling of the "Mumblecore" movement. They are real people who are painfully caught up in their own self-contained neuroses and unwilling to change, unable. For them, the real world is their own delusion, and because this is a film about people who are so deeply non-contact, it is very difficult to see them. It's a 16mm film with no real light, money or other factors that would make a movie "smooth", but its honesty can not be underestimated. This would lead to a room full of people rejecting him and Richard Linklater gave him an award as he did at SXSW. This is reminiscent of films like "Naked" or the best of "Mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows with you the longer you think about it.
