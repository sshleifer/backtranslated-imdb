A very entertaining movie that shows characters doing bad things, leaving emotions like anger and lust for revenge. The cast is very good, there is a lot of action and in the end Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist). I have seen this movie several times and always see if it is on AMC or cable. Highly recommended...
