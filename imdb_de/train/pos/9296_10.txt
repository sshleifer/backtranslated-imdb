I love this movie. It's crazy, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of a madman and definitely not an ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find the movie amusing, I guess it's just not for you. So it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> For reference Some of the other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (she only caught me the second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I'm ready to accept that most people do not like these kinds of things. I do not apologize for an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this film are well put together, the verbal humor is funny, the situations are fascinating. The drama is very good (as you would expect from the cast), although the scripting needs are not particularly high. The overall package provides fun, entertaining, yet violent entertainment.
