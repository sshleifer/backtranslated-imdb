I saw this in the preview - great movie - wonderful characterizations - witty and intelligent dialogue actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will stand for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - photography was wonderful when Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie and He spoke vividly about the genesis of the film - it had been a long dream of him to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationships between sons and fathers, and especially between him and his father - this was achieved in dramatic and entertaining fashion - the understudy was well chosen and gave the film a family feel - I recommend this movie to anyone who longs for intelligent drama and wonderful performances
