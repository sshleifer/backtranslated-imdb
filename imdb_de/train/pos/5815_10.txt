I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He was and is the greatest of all times. A few days ago a friend gave me a present. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again. After many years, he threw me back into the past. I nearly cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but because of the good old days that I remembered when I went to concerts, enjoyed music and danced. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a kid. You can really see the parody Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me to these great times, to your great music and dancing. It's a shame people forgot you. I did not do it because you gave me great moments with your music.
