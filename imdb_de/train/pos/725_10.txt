The fascist director Miss Togar (Mary Voronov, blinded by the experienced photographer Dean Cundy as three meters tall) has the plan to completely change its peak. There are complications that challenge this goal in the sexy Rock'n'Roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles, who lights the screen - she also has a hot figure) - who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big glasses and Nerdy role can not hide her breathtaking beauty) joins forces with Reef to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing Rock'n'Roll, like Togar's aspired mission is /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a witty role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything, but after all. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if he could just pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard almost steals the movie (honestly, who can steal that movie from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, "the supplier," who can get almost anything. His office is on the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riffs when he enjoys a concert by THE RAMONES. <br /> <br /> A rough high school trump that goes against all rules of normalcy ... and I loved it. It's like someone just says, "Let's make life fun for 1 Â½ hours." The movie is really anarchy ... a chaos that affectionately reveres the RAMONES with all their hearts (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to win new audiences with this film). <br /> <br /> The Das Ende sums up the film as a whole ... Riff and her classmates take over high school and a huge party begins. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! In no way conventional, this movie just makes a noise. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of THE RAMONES 'best songs, this movie allows the viewer to accept a time in life when the war did not dominate the headlines and people just had fun. Those were the days.
