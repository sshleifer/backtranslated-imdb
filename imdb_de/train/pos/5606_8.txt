This is a very difficult movie and it is almost impossible to get a handle on it. At first, it seems to be about a rather pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and is blatantly inviting when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists and turns begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why the clothes of the dead tenant appear in the apartment? Finally, one wonders if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski pulls us is to lie to us. We assume that when we see things from the perspective of a character, when we see things the way the character does, and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume that when the camera shows us things from its omniscient point of view, that we are up to date - but Polanski has lied to us.
