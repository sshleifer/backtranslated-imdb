I inadvertently mistakenly said it was behind the movie box of what I thought I would rent it, did not figure it out until I got home and watched it anyway. Absolutely fantastic! A wonderful movie and one of my three favorites I've ever seen. I recommend it to anyone! <br /> <br /> The story is enjoyable and easy to follow The director makes it great to keep it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, show a wonderful character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> Need to find a copy somewhere ...........
