Together with the South Pacific, Guys and Dolls is for adults - it's cheeky, sexy and full of men, men and women strung together. <br /> <br /> There's an energy and a drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the power of Jean Simmond's performance, the charm of a young Brando and an already masterful Sinatra make a big difference to the overall look and feel Overall impression of the piece. Guys and Dolls wins it is unclear what it is: an MGM musical. <br /> <br /> Still good to look at and hear, with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of the 20th century and be viewed with pleasure for years to come. <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
