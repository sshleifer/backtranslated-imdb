People forget that there have been several King Kong rip-offs - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), everyone pulls off each other, but YETI stands alone. It borrows only one element of King Kong and that's the animal's attraction with a woman. <br /> <br /> The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists have once intrigued it, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but worth it to see it. The first time I saw it on Elvira's mistress of the dark shows was in the early 80's. It sent shivers down my spine as a kid, especially when the YETI got angry. I saw it again, around 1:00 am on ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. When I saw it again, I appreciated it more, it has overall good effects (for its time) and the story is about a dumb boy and his dog and a bad businessman who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Also the music is pretty cool, she is very YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great, monster-like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and a half of 10 points.
