The unobtrusive, subtle and slim film "The Man in a White Suit" is another breath of fresh air in the cinematic format of Ealing Studios. Although I suspect that some modern viewers initially find it obscure, I do not doubt that many could be enchanted by the informed manner of the plot. The motifs and characters are boring during the film class. <br /> <br /> The really great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a movie, perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing's inspired "Child Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time he plays only one character instead of eight, but as a world-wide inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he is always in the process of finding the right tone and expression. Along with Guinness' subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast is effective. Among the main players are Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger. Thesiger is irresistibly absurd as a crippled but influential business grandi, while Parker is reliable as an ineffective but crucial mill owner and father. Father, that is Joan Greenwood, the skilful and delicious comic actress, who is at her insurmountable climax in this film. Splendid and seductive in terms of aspect and expression, she is rather sublime in this film, a fine contrast to the similarly unusual, but rather foul-smelling Guinness. The scene in which she seems to be trying to try him is played so skillfully by the couple that it is both deeply moving and amusing. <br /> <br /> The topics are handled very effectively without morality being taken. The complexity of relationships between science, industry and workers is enlightened and pleasantly studied. This film, expertly conducted by Alexander Mackendrick, is technically well-versed in all areas; atmospheric photography, matching sound effects and music as well as a wistful script impress quietly. A thoroughly satisfying movie, with Guinness and Greenwood gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
