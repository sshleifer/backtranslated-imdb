A sophisticated contemporary fable about the burdens that loosen and ultimately solve the marriage promise. The main message of the narrative is based on a "homily" spoken by a land priest after the vow of a young, cosmopolitan couple from Milan. It defines the future course of marriage, which gradually dissolves from the burdens of modern life. The 'morality' of this story in a story is that it was necessary for a marriage now, both in the past and in the past, that this relationship was broken by family and friends. This movie was a relative blockbuster for domestic Italian relationships. It's a terrible shame that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
