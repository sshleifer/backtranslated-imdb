I first read the book when I was a young teenager, and then watched the movie late one night. About a year ago I checked it for IMDb and found that no copies are available. I then went to the internet and found a website that War Films offers. I am glad that I did that, ordered a copy and was able to sit back and confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion In order to truly enjoy the movie, I recommend you get a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I've located a copy of E-bay. Author Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during World War II and participated in various secret operations. This was his first book. It's written by someone who knows, and that fact that I believe gives authenticity to the book and the movie. I did not just give the movie a ten, just because of the way the movie ended, not as good as the book. There are a few lines of action that are different from the book, which is strange because the book is not about the great extent of the war, but about the individual at war. The film illustrates this extremely well. I have the copy of the book to have my son read, and then the movie to watch him in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can find the book and the movie, it's definitely worth it, and I just wish it was more available to read and see more, one of my best war films of all time !
