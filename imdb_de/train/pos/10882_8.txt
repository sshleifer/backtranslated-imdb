This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, ie the film within a film. The well-known actress runs in the first scene for her life. This film takes on the old convention of a psycho-killer and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It's always nice to see Molly Ringwald again for the attack. <br /> <br /> So this could be an example of what has become of the genre. The cut hits all markers and is frightening in some places. I liked it, I was careful.
