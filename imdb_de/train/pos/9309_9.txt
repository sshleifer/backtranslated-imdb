Dear God, where do I start? This is not the best movie I have ever seen. The camera angles are great, but acting was the best in my opinion. Why the scriptwriters of this film do not write movies on a big budget, I will never understand. another is the cast. It is great. that's the best ted raimi movie out there. I know some of you are probably thinking, "By no means, he's much better," but not your fault. Raptor Island is a work of art. I hope it would have gotten the best movie of the year, rather than this crappy movie crash with a bunch of names and no birds of prey. I think that this movie is really the most beautiful thing ever.
