The emotional impact of this film leaves no words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic in two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full spectrum of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought this must be a coincidence for the blockbuster, the superior actor Smith. His performances in both films show Smith a whole other dimension, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts. I'm not sure, but I see him differently now. Seven pounds is one of those films that, in order to fully enjoy their essence, must break your faith. Do not pay attention to the plot, but to the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, reconciliation, love and sacrifice.
