In one of the bloodiest movies of all time, a transvestite has murdered people in New York, and the answer to anything might not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma influenced Hitchcock with camera settings and such. Michael Caine plays a very thoughtful role, while Angie Dickinson is a bored, rich woman with a bad haircut. Keith Gordon (who later played in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And after you've seen it, you may never know who you can trust. With Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
