Unlike Tinseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's hit Broadway thriller could not wait until the incarnation stage was complete before being shown on the screen White Way Run! The opening and closing scenes of the film will be shot in New York's intimate Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP has played for almost five years. Even the final fade out of the movie on the theater tent is a version of the famous logo of the stage. (Although the marketers have opted for a funnier Rubik's Cube icon.) <br /> <br /> Now for a cheap DVD release, DEATHTRAP appears as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is just right (better than their counterparts on stage), and location scouts should be applauded to find a reasonably creepy house where our "One Room, Two Act Thriller" can take place. Opened in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely marks every "new" material at the beginning and end of the film, leaving Levin's evil, curious center alone. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film is a major Hollywood departure from the boards and undermines one of Levin's Conspiracies shows from the previous section of the film [Helga (on a dagger): "Is by another woman used because she plays. "]. As in THE PLAYER by Robert Altman, our new finale will help the film regain its composure, blurring the boundaries between stage, screen, and (can it?) Real life!
