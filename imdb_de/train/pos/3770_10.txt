When will people know that some movies are made for fun and not necessarily change the world? If you are aware of this, have fun watching "Bill and Ted's Wrong Journey". This is a movie that is a lot of fun to watch. Keanu and Alex are a great team that presents their characters from "Bill and Ted's Outstanding Adventure" with even more "style" than in the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great for a laugh. The characters are extremely similar and the story is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep-and-Sinnfulls", but expect pure fun!
