Although this film has brought Davis onto the map for her brilliant, intense performance as waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, who is illiterate, this film is unsatisfactory for me overall. The drama is good in almost every way. What I can not fathom for my life is how, or why, Phillip, a sensitive, well-behaved young man, lets himself be exposed to the constant abuse that this swindler constantly spits out. Yes, I know that he is a sensitive, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a venomous witch that no one who is cultivated would tolerate her attitude or behavior and make her credible. Davis is amazing in her role: yes, she can occasionally go overboard in her histrionics, but it's a vivid, creative depiction, no matter what point of view. Too bad she did not play a gangster minor. Your character would have been absolutely credible as a trample among the low-lives!
