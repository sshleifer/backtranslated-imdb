This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you do not like smart movies. There are two men who wish the world would disappear, and that is exactly what they get. The show is great, the end was unpredictable and, unlike most films of the day, actually had a good story. People complain that the movie is too easy or too boring. I think they should just get involved in movies like The Toxic Avenger or The Grim Adventures by Billy and Mandy. One note: If you notice this, it has exactly the same actors from Cube, except four actors. Take two notes: wait for the credits (trust me on this). Enjoy the movie.
