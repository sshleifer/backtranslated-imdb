This is one of the movies that make better trailers than feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just had the feeling that the opportunity was missing to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and jokes hung too long, had no final end and did not really make me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underused in this film and needed more exposure and more ways to bring her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more like a DVD rental. In addition, in the credits, I searched for some kind of feel-good music video, something that has become a trademark of these romantic comedy films, a la Something About Mary, the feeling that this COULD has been a much better movie with a little more music and punchy punchlines, has cheated a bit. It felt like it had gotten into the theater RUSHED.
