I saw the McCoys reunion and was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! It was wonderful to see them now because I've seen the series getting bigger so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not there. I know that Walter Brennan died. So I got on my computer and tried to find her, and found this website. So if there's someone here who can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I would be grateful !!) I was looking for everything and no luck, the only thing I can find out about Michael Winkelman was, that he should be born in 1946. This show had value and morals, every show had a lesson to learn, and the whole cast was unbelievably the only thing better than figuring out whether to meet them that's impossible if there's someone who can help, please do that. Thank you Glenda
