Talk about a premiere, "Trampa Infernal" has the coolest opening balance ever! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps a little bit inspired by the legendary theme "Friday the 13th" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main actors appear on the screen in huge syllables. A promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller that gets cooler with every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-laden paintball opponents call each other for the ultimate showdown in a shabby bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a wild bear in the nearby woods that has already killed several hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge is that the one who kills the bear is declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest balls. On arrival, however, it quickly becomes clear that they are not against a bear, but a confused and extremely crazy war veteran with a rich arsenal of weapons in his hiding place and numerous fighting tricks up his sleeve. After a decade of taming and derivative American slashers, the Mexican effort of the early 1990s looks refreshing and vibrant. The formula is simple but efficient, the main characters are plausible enough, and building a confrontation with the sadistic killer is pretty exciting. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as he also uses a homemade glove with sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasingly evil and barbaric, which I had hoped for since the ingenious opening sequences, and waste a lot of unnecessary blood. The forestry and especially the camouflaged booby traps are spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican Slasher / Survival sleeper highly recommended to fans of the genre.
