Deathtrap gives you a turn every turn, every single turn, in fact the biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you can never really orient yourself in the movie, and it often does not make sense, even though they usually catch you by surprise , The story is very good, apart from the fact that she has so many twists. The script is very good with great dialogues and characters, but due to the twists you can not see all the developments. The performances especially by Caine are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The visual effects are fair, but most are actually in a game and are fake. Twisted way too much, but still works and is worth seeing.
