I love cartoons. You can show things that films with "real" actors and scenes can not - although computer effects are changing more and more. You can move the boundaries of satire ("The Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), drama ("Aladdin"), or reality ("Toy Story"). There are some good examples in 'Ice Age', for example, when we see a colorful herd of extinct mammals that roam the land and chat like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to see as we feel that we are both familiar and alien at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although Ice Age is not as good as the best animated films of all time, it's a really funny movie. Sit back and enjoy the intentional anachronisms, the beautiful backgrounds and the belly laugh. <br /> <br /> The story tells of Manfred, the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiot sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take one Human Baby back to their tribe - for very different reasons. Of course they have a lot of problems along the way. Scrat, the country's most unlucky rodent, desperately tries to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable ending and a middle made up only of a series of funny incidents, with some character-building moments, but some of the scenes. like the diaper change or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are sympathetic and it looks good. There is also a touching moment when mammoth cave paintings come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> Not a must, but good for a fun hour or so. <br /> <br /> 7/10
