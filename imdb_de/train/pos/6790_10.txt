This game is one of the best RPGs. Faust, it's actually more amusing than the rest, because of the combat system (you harm the enemy, depending on how you target the attack, you can turn into dragoon, the special attack, the magic ...) The script is very good. The characters are all lovely and there are no long dialogues that need support, as was the case in several games in the Final Fintasy series. I got bored of these dialogues about the past if you just want to continue the story of the game. Ambientation is a jewel in this game, it combines fantasy from the Middle Ages with futuristic science fiction. It's worth noting that animation effects are just amazing. I like them more than other modern games (we can not remember that Legend of the Dragoon is now 8 years old). Then Map is huge, there are all kinds of areas. After all, music is not the best game I've ever heard, but it's perfect for such a game.
