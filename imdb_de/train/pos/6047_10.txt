The genius of Withnail & I is that it captures that college and life would not be long in coming. Freebird is for those who have probably never considered higher education and worked directly at the age of 15/16. I know some of the broad leaves put the knife in this movie when it came out in theaters, but I saw it in a crowded house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the forest of Dean and that brought me right back to my mushroom and dope days (having some great buddies - I hate to think about what they've done so far - likely to run the council). I've seen it a couple of times on DVD and I already see the movie as an old buddy who will stay in my collection forever (how do I like this movie and the Dambusters - somehow that does not seem right) I'm in the second half contrary to this film and I think the social interaction scenes with the locals are brilliant. I like the mix of the three main characters and here are some nice fonts along with some very quotable lines. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (too bad, because it's a corker). Someone told me it was originally a stage play, not exactly sure how it works, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearean touches / references that pop up throughout the movie (the Dylan Thomas-Ref was also discovered), and like all the little gems, there's always something to discover, like the final scene that Easyrider nods They start the next journey. All in all a really unpretentious piece of filmmaking (love it!)
