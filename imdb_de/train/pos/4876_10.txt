I do not know why some people from the USA, Georgia, or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings that they do not understand. For those who have not seen this movie - look at it. Do not expect too much or do not frame, just because this is Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand all the humor. The people of Serbia have actually married while Bil Clinton bombed their villages unexpectedly pure and colorful and the Balkans is extremely creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie, I can only see that the Americans are (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) much worse than a pure, honest, humorous Balkan Romance as Promise me. The comment should be useful and second the personal view of the author. I think the film great, and the people look to that the director and the story that is told it must show respect. It's easy, but true. It's brutal but gentle and makes you laugh.
