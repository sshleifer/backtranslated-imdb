Julie Walters has been one of my role models since training for Rita, and her accomplishments as a woman helping the man she loves to balance with his female side are great. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a minor actress, but Walters brings it with enthusiasm and verve. Adrian Pasdar shows his best performance so far in the male lead.
