** SPOILER ALERT ** W. Somerset Maugham's classic film about a love-obsessed young man who was hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession so that he loses everything he can only find to be true love find circumstances. <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard plays the role of Philip Carey, a sensitive young artist in Paris who tries to make a living selling his paintings. When told by an art expert on site that his work is not good enough to be sold to art visitors, Philip decides to return to his native England, study medicine and become a doctor to help others. <br /> <br /> Philip, who was born with a clubfoot, is very hypersensitive to his awkward condition and offsets it by being a very pleasant and friendly person. One afternoon Philip is in a local café with a medical classmate and discovers the pretty waitress Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis, and immediately falls in love with her. Mildred initially rejects the lovesick Philip, but later realizes what a juice he is and uses his feelings for her. Mildred has invested him in poverty to buy her gifts and bring her to the theater every time she leaves work. Phlip also leaves behind his studies by paying so much attention to Mildred at the medical university and failing his final exams. <br /> <br /> When buying an engagement ring for Mildred in an attempt to ask for her in marriage, the cold-hearted Mildred tells the startled Philip that she's already engaged to be married to Alan Hale, Emil Miller to be. It turns out that he is one of the customers in the café she always flirts with. <br /> <br /> Philip is broke and has a heart condition. He slowly brings his life together again. Later he resumes his medical examination and passes it. At the same time he finds a new love in Nora, Fay Johnson, a writer for a local love magazine. Later, to Philip's shock and surprise, Mildred goes back to his life. <br /> <br /> Mildred, who tells Philip that her husband Emil, the child she's carrying with her, threw her out of the house, has the kindness and understanding that Philip, at the expense of Nora, who was in love with him, brings back. Later it turns out that Mildred was not married to Emil, but had an illegitimate child because he had an illicit affair with him! It turned out that Emil was already married. <br /> <br /> As before, Mildred uses Philip's friendly heart for her and her young daughter, where he supports her with food assistance and accommodation, to the point where he goes broke again and can not continue his studies ending by leaving Philip; after a very heated and emotional encounter with him. Out in the street is Philip Athanly, Reginald Owens, who was once hospitalized and falls in love with his daughter Sally, Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> Later, Philip corrected his clubfoot in the medical center and becomes a doctor again with the help of Mr. Athenly. Then he meets again Mildred, who is really at the end of her rope. She dies from tuberculosis and has lost her daughter. She is alone and nobody cares about her. Philip is now well respected in the medical circles and is doing everything to help the sick and poor Mildred, but in the end she succumbs to her illness and dies. <br/> <br/> Mildred had the love and devotion in Philip. In all the years he was in love with her, he decided to abuse him and have relationships with people who were just like her, cold and callous and selfish. In the end, Mildred got back exactly what she gave to the benevolent and sensitive Philip: she became both unloved and alone. In the sweet and caring Sally, Philip found everything that Mildred was not, and eventually found the true love he had sought all his life.
