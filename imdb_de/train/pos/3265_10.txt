I have always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan since I saw her series a few years ago !! This movie will surely show you in its best light !! The movie was so wonderfully filled and played !! Now and then she drops little funny lines, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everyone really turns out !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd really made the movie true !! I also loved the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when she falls to the ground !! This is the finest film !!
