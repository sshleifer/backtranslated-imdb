I chose 8 for this movie because of some small childish flaws. Apart from that, this movie is one of my favorites! It's entertaining, to say the least. The shooting scenes are ridiculous, though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes some of his "matrix obsession". It seems their enemies are just there ... waiting to be shot at. However, this film touches and always makes me cry. It has a lot of GREAT humor, so I make you laugh too. Gackt is a great actor, I must say ... he shows so much emotion. This was the first time Hyde played, and he was fine. The role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT MISS IT! YOU WILL REGRET IT!
