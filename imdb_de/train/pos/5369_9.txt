Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold will play as Ben Richards, a falsely convicted man forced to play "The Running Man," a deadly TV game show in which people have to move on to brutally flee deaths by the "stalkers". Of course, people are expected to die at some point, and it's up to Arnold to prove the system wrong. I did not read Stephen King's book, but this is still a great movie, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the Action Man role and delivers death with memorable one-liners. Classics are probably the "He was a real pain in the neck," after strangling a man with barbed wire, and "He had to split!" And referred to the whereabouts he had just chained by seeing someone vertical. Dawson is completely irritating as a television presenter, and all "stalkers" are suitable for a camp. The action is violent, but it's an action movie. That is the point. The film is fast and with 90 minutes he does not exceed his greeting. <br /> <br /> With Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser at the helm following the success of The Terminator, this movie was probably just another senseless action car for Arnold and very far-fetched. Today, if you watch a lot of TV, you could see how the movie gets closer to reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the TV in the near future and see a show not far away. <br /> <br /> But I have to recommend 'The Running Man' on this depressing note. to anyone who likes the '80s, Arnold, ridiculous deeds or violence, or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
