I'm sure this is a show no one is so familiar with and may not think so well. After all, it's almost near Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the location, the style of the director and her advertising? shows women walking around on the beach and all that. No wonder people have misconceptions and decide not to look at it. <br /> <br /> It was wrong for them to do that. Because after I've decided to see the show, there's actually more, really hefty story and conflict. It turns out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel employees, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the annoying hotel guest and the mighty man who tries to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that the actor is shit, but it is not so bad that you look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack fits in quite well with the scenario and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before anything really solid, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really like to see this. Zillion Times Better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my rating after reading, thank you.
