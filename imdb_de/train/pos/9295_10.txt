It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this all-star movie. I laughed all over the picture, as did my whole family. The film was clearly defined as an old-time gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old time when they did it. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and how about those Everly sisters, each of the two Falco's, and the divine music everywhere. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver and Gabriel Byrne a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character, and the entire morgue and tomb. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added appeal of running after Byrne decided to make a duet of his "My Way" welcome, in which Vick will be home, was a weird tribute to Frank Sinatra and his friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I also think that nobody at any age would even think of imitating the actions that occurred in this movie - it's a joke - not a horrible "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, as was the decorative "Vic's Place". <br /> <br /> I really think of "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy that is less harmful than many cartoons, TV thrillers and talk shows. I would recommend the video for a family entertainment evening.
