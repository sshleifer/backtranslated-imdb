As far as parody films are concerned, there are only a few who are worth the time and energy. But with a recent revival of terrible parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to rediscover a really fun farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end Of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mob. What's broke is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who does not speak American (at least profanely), a rival gangster with a penchant for shutting his mouth off (... once!), A younger brother with the D.A. who wants to be dangerous to Johhny, and a hot young star who is hot on his affection has Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will usually be busy laughing as every gangster movie clich√© is impaled by a talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
