This is the movie for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a very special atmosphere of post-war Germany. They are immersed in the dream and only released at the end of the credits. The plot necessarily comes second, but it's still an exciting story where difficult questions are raised. Just wonderful.
