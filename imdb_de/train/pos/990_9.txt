I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is pretty much out there ... The federal government is getting a tracking device implanted in the jaw of a thief to lure a more dangerous thief / computer hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man the government has "voluntarily" used to implant the device, is a very personable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun to get into his head for a while. Alvin even turns out to be much more than a good-humored, but passive or one-dimensional figure, in showing that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem. Definitely worth a watch.
