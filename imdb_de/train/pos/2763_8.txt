People tend to complain about the number of films about the mentally handicapped. I do not see that as a legitimate criticism, only as complaints about too many films about anybody. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the script and the manual. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work together perfectly, with Duquenne essentially playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly wide range of events and is not content simply to go through what was to be seen in "Rain Man". The end is pretty depressing, but it does not ruin the wonderful story that has come before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
