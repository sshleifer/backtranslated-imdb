I can remember seeing this movie in 1977 or 1978 as a kid. HBO would show it late at night when they were the only movie pay channel that exists. At that time it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially then. I would very much like to see it now as an adult, where I could rather understand the adult theme. It was probably the best I've ever seen in pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Luckily I had stupid babysitters and partygoers on weekends. Most of the memory of this movie was the totally unpredictable sexual behavior of these two men. Breaking into houses, sniffing underwear, eating a stranger's mother's milk in a public bus, and staying in a cab at the request of one of her female subjects were just a few of the crazy antics these guys took off. A very fast-paced movie for the early 70s. I had no idea that this movie had such a following until I checked IMDb. Most of the people I talk to have never heard of it.
