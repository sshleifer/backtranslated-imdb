**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse movie showing how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their best friends and family members without realizing which monsters they are. It is too late until the fall of the bull-like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen. <br /> <br /> It's 1922 and the heights of the Irish Black & Tan revolt against the mighty British Empire with the Tanzanian British occupation forces in search of the wanted Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip and Wallace Ford, wanted to kill a Briish soldier. Gypo is a good, really best friend of the elusive McPhillip and has no luck with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, who was forced to do tricks in Dublin's red light district to pay her rent. <br /> After a outraged Gypo revising a potential John who wants to spend a few hours with Katie, an angry Katie tells the not-so-smart gyro that he prevents her from supporting herself with the only bankable good she has, her body. Katie also tells Gypo that he should wake up with reality and realize what a desperate situation she is in right now. She tells the upturned Gypo that it would cost only ten pounds if she goes to America and comes out of Ireland's poverty. Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip he had just seen when he received a reward from 20 pounds sterling had announced. That's enough money for him and Kaite to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo, who goes to a local flophouse in Dublin, and a soup kitchen to get a free meal, scares to meet his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him that he was in Dublin to see both his mother Mrs. McPhillip and his sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and that he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home and later to his Irish Republican unit goes outside the city. <br /> <br /> All Gypo can see in Frankie's face is the 20-pound reward he gets turned into the police! Without further thought, Gypo, after assuring Frankie that everything is alright, secretly goes to the police and informs his friend, who was later shot dead in a policeman and tan shoot at his mothers house. <br /> <Actually, the chief of police hands over the Â£ 20 sterling, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes her and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that he can be seen. You can see in the face and actions of the police chief that he has no choice but to betray Gypo to his friend Frankie McPhillip. Although he was wanted for murder and enemy of the British Empire. Thus, low traitors or informants are also held by those for whom they secretly work. Gypo turns out to be his worst enemy after his betrayal of Frankie while his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, who points his finger and implies him in Frankie's treachery and death by the British authorities. Gypo's guilty feelings have made him regally drunk and glorious with the reward money. When he was forced to admit his crime to his colleagues in the Irish Republican Army, who had the almost dead, drunken and sloppy Gypo to justice, the money was in the process of drinking and listening. <br /> <br /> Whatever the good feelings, if it is possible, that you had for the weak and heavily shouldered gypos, was completely destroyed when they were in total desperation. Not to be shot, he implies mistakenly informing an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime, his friend Frankie McPhillip. Which quickly turns out to be a total manifestation of others other than the guilty Gypo himself. The dye is then poured as straws are drawn for the ones who would throw a bullet in Gypo's head to siphon off the final chapter of this spasmodic and memorable Crime & Punishment classic.
