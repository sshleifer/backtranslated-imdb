A family (Mother Patricia Clarkson, Father Jake Weber, Son Erik Per Sullivan) goes to a family reunion in a secluded house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This scares some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things are slowly (VERY slowly) going awry. <br /> <br /> I expected the worst when I started to look at it. Most reviews on this page are extremely negative. Well, I do not agree. First of all, it's not a horror movie. The horror begins only in the last 30 minutes. It is more like a family drama with horror elements inserted. At this level, it's damn good. <br /> <br /> First - the bad stuff: The pace is far too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; WAY to scare too many false dream sequences; The Wendigo hardly gets into the movie and the clear view of the Wendigo at the end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The good stuff: Pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is honored as a mother. a great direction with sinister sound effects that are a bit scary; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); pretty good spectacle of Sullivan (then only 10!) and Speredakos and a totally unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are annoyed about this movie because it's being pushed as a horror movie it's not If you can ignore that, you might like it. I give him a 7.
