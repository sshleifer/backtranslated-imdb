After seeing several Villaronga films, I had a pretty clear opinion of him - he focuses too much on the personal aspect of the characters and forgets a rhythm of the movie. That's why his films, though they were good critics, never caught the attention of the audience. In ARo he follows the same line, but has really improved the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. To be honest, I slept the first part, because although the first part provides necessary information, it is really slow. Still, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole movie the best movie Villaronga has ever done. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
