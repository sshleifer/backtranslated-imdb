I saw this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was totally blown away. The structure and execution of the film was fantastic ... I know that this will not be the case, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and I see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, because it is the shooting of schools and you can identify especially with the murderers. Despite its hard and dull theme Zero Day is absolutely worth seeing. I'm looking forward to it appearing on video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the end sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic. Their insecurity, the "recordings", the footage and the panic of the students are completely indescribable. I really hope it gets the attention it deserves. It's the same format as the Blair Witch Project, a handheld camera that appears as a true documentary for home videos - but God is infinitely better. Very impressive. Has everyone involved. If you have the chance, you should really see it.
