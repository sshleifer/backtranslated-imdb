The 1933 Raoul Walsh classic, The Bowery, places the owner and operator of the sedan Wallace Beery against fierce rival and dandy George Raft, with the adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and the handsome Faye Wray in roles between their big names Play rivalries. It's not clear what the rivalry is all about, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. There are lots of jokes in the beginning, but the characters get softer as the movie progresses. Apart from that, the overwhelming scene is the scenes in Beery's Salon. The different characters, a sexy chorus line, lots of alcohol, a perfect creation of a misdeed that is not overly rejected by so-called pre-code restrictions, and later comes the Carrie Nations, which are run by Carrie Nation himself. All this gives a very vivid picture of a bygone life. I do not like comparing epochs, but this movie is fundamentally different from anything you would see today. The film has a lot of heart and lost a lot of innocence and is absolutely a must.
