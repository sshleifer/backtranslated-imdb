The geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells make this extraordinary anticipation film whose ambition is hard to find today. They predict World War II and the way Britain was attacked, as well as the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. You change the time. In film, war and space research are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it is amazing. We even see a helicopter (the movie is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable gigantic airplanes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists who seem to be Romans with bladder helmets: If you look through these funny costumes, you may appreciate them The masters of state-of-the-art architecture from the 1930s, Wells' vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as the archetype of the adventurous and inventive man who chooses to shape rather than shape reality, let it shape you. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring like the last monologue by John Cabal.
