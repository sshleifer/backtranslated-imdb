Usually, the best way to annoy me in a movie is to point out Orson Welles. But here's a sci-fi comedy citing the show War of the Worlds ... and it's gold! The concept of confusing a small pile of tiny, aggressive and stupid aliens as children in Halloween clothes is great. Do not be fooled by the idea that the movie looks like a children's movie because it's not easy - there are no hidden treasures ... A gem!
