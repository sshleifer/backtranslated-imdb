Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe that it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The significance of this documentary is not to show how good a man is to Chavez. It's really a demonstration of how the Bolivarians saw it happen, as Chavez sees it. Although it may seem wrong and biased to support a movie, I think the point of view shown in the film is perfectly legitimate. The Venezuelan people saw only a one-sided perspective of the coup, the neoliberal side of Venezuela's private media society. This movie shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Let's call it propaganda.
