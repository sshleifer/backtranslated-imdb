It is time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his last death, but this film is not the one. His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. This 1973 film attempted to prophesy a future Earth in 2022. so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by the authorities to eat a universally produced food product called "Soylent Green" made with human flesh. This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous as it is today at the time of its release and assumes that India's population, which at that time would be about $ 2 billion, would be meat eaters without knowing it. Charlton Heston's This unaffected the secret international conspiracy concocted by the world powers to satisfy the dietary needs of overpopulation through cannibalism. Unfortunately, for the producers of this film, the green message they deliver is not the Greens party today, thank God. Cannibalism was practiced by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo until just 40 years before the filming of the film, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. Another stupid prediction in this film is that women are almost becoming sex slaves who turn against the radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 with the emergence of this film. <br /> <br /> The film was stupid at the time and is now so stupid, but it contains a very memorable recent movie appearance of the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but still no good reason to watch the movie for any reason other than to visit again for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I can not recommend Baby Boomer or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this movie that I have read all sound the same way and refer to a dystopian society in whose future the centralized issue seems to concern only the US, in which an ecological catastrophe has occurred. that the earth faces the overpopulation.
