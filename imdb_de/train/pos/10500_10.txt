Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the series, it is still a classic and as good as the old ones. Games with so much replay value are few and far between. Plus, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels, each with different tasks and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but the lack of a challenge does not take the game away at all. Once you've made it, you should clear your game and start again. And it's just as much fun the second, third, or two hundredth time. A must have for any Nintendo 64 owner and a reason to own a Nintendo 64.
