I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not great, but it has many great elements. The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but not worse than in the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gore is good. It has the great leather face in the movie and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I saw the full movie and was predictable but still enjoyable. The women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and scary. The film was remarkably clean for a modern movie and the acts of violence for children over 13 years old. There were no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think that's fair. I would take another look at it, if I had nothing better to do. The gay-sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is pretty scary.
