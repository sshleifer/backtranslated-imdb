A wonderful early musical film by Rene Clair, as funny and funny as his dumb "The Italian Straw Hat". Clair used the phrase expressively, not just for dialogue and effects, and influenced the early musicals in America (the opera scene of A Night at the Opera, for example, is heavily influenced by Le Million). Should (but not) be seen by all cinephiles, and the Criterion DVD is as good as you would expect. There are not many extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are useless and the interview with Clair on the CD is one that I've never seen before. Get it while it's still there.
