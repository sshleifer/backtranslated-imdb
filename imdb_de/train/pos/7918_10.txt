I loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie. I was introduced as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. You may remember me even more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf exhibited in the movie. I was the woman in the front row with my hands on my face to respond to what we saw on the movie projector. In fact, they have doubled me a few times, so it's hard to overlook this mistake. Thumbs up to full moon high. I wish to cable it soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana I loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie.
