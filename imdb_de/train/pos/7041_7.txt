WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergey Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy (Voice of: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> One Hit-and-Miss 21st Century "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? Who wrote the script together with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? Stars as an emaciated hitman named Brand Hauser, burned out but deciding to do one last job by ennobling a Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not THAT Omar Sharif, but you get the sound here) Misfire) (laughs), commanded by former US Vice President (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Grosse Pointe Blank" co-ordinator, bringing a thick Dick Cheney-Manqu√© phrase here) and Brand on the pretext of a trade do show producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the American private company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> During the briefing, Brand stands for a moment of clarity when he encounters the intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Tamerlane is now sponsoring the unlikely union of East European teenage sensation Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff with her own celebrity piercing cheeks) and the Idiot of the Country Guide. <br /> <br /> What follows is a brave attempt at a black comedy of the 21st century a la "DR. STRANGELOVE", but despite all the intensity and expediency, there are unfortunately more misses than hits in this broad attempt at laughter amidst outsource a political message (of an unjust war) from American capitalism, check!) While Cusack plays on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned "Pointe" riffs, he adds some nice touches to his man Black (he takes recordings of Tabasco sauce) is catching up with the rest of the cast (except for sister Joan, who shakes up as an excited adjutant to Hauser and has one of the movie's funniest laughs: "My communication skills eventually pay off") <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree difference "Grace Is Gone" and has his political views up on his sleeve; The film's tempo and rhythms are surprisingly good, but first filmmaker Joshua Seftel made his directorial debut here (and it's conspicuous), except perhaps the well-choreographed fight that Hauser deals with Babyyeah's enthusiast /> <br /> one nice try, but a misguided mistake; Maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the idiocy of the war speak for itself instead of lifting it hard.
