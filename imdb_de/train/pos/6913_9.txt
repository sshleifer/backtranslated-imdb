As a community theater actor who works hard but does not take acting too seriously, I'm always amused by those who treat him as a great art. This film spits mercilessly on the "Actor's Craft", while he brings many good laughs on the table. <br /> <br /> A ham actor on location for a movie resembles the dictator. When the dictator dies of too much drinking and eating from a heart attack, the actor is kidnapped and forced by the neo-Nazi chief of intelligence to play "the role of life". He plays it all the way, gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables beautifully on his kidnappers. <br /> <br /> Lots of great consequences from the leads, lots of good work from some unknown supporting actors, especially the household staff and two members of the palace guard, and funny little cameos in abundance. Sammy Davis Jr. is fooling himself, Jonathan Winters plays a half-retired American businessman with something else, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss are extraordinary. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, but there are many beautiful locations (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors who do their thing and look like they are having fun and are not going through the usual existential ones Fear, which is only spectacle.
