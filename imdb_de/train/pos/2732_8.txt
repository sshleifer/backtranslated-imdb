Herbet Clutter, Ms. Bonnie, and her teenage children Kenyon and Nancy had been very popular and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas, but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote, who stormed the scene and followed the course of the case until its completion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well written, it has become an international bestseller and is still a touchstone for crime writers. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many real locations, it seems somewhat documentary, icy and distant - and the overall cast is extraordinary. This is the movie on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor is based, and rightly so. As Perry Smith's killer, Blake captures you between a deep dislike and the shock of unexpected sympathy; It's a masterful performance from start to finish. Scott Hilson is no less good at Richard Hickock. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to the Clutter House - only to suddenly rush past the film's crime to detail the investigation that eventually ensues led to their arrest and conviction. The heart of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in the Clutter House; Actually filmed in Clutter House itself, it's an exciting sequence, terrible and deeply disturbing. Director and writer Richard Brooks directs the film with a very strong sense of deliberation and errs only in the sense that he lets the film preach easily. However, given the overall strength of the film, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
