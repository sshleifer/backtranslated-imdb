After briefly seeing Batman Dead End, I did not know what to expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman AND Batman. All of my best comic books in the world contain them as a team. <br /> <br /> After watching this three and a half minute trailer, I wanted someone to make a serialized fan movie for World's Finest. If it's not a real full-length movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of the Superman stuff was cheesy, but cinema trailers in theaters are always teasers and only give you certain aspects of the entire product. It looks like it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> Apart from Sandy Collera's relative, who plays a very poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a movie was made, the actors would be cast according to the bill for the film, though I believe that Nina Kaczorowski would be a good lois lane, especially if the character is attached closer to the character. <br /> <br /> It's good to see that Clark Bartram wears the Bat Endendale Batman costume, but it should be updated a bit more than the 40s Batman with the 80s-90s leather cloak and hood , His behavior is Batman-like, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses, instead of his eyes being visible only through the mask. I think the goal was to get as close to the cartoon character as the movie did. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He stands around with a stupid expression that simply says "hit me". And line delivery seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, I would like to see a complete story and a movie based on this ingenious work. There was a rumor about creating one of the most beautiful movies in the world, and with the right additions to the script, this could be the case. Hope more to be done.
