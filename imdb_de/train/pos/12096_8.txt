I have seen this movie several times and found it very good. This movie is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele is her usual beautiful / scary self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is filled with atmosphere and there is a lot of excitement. The camera angles are good and the drama is not bad for the most part. This movie is perfect for a rainy day or evening. I have the uncut DVD version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Grab popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy it. John R. Tracy
