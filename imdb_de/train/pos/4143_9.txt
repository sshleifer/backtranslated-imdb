No, I'm not kidding. If you ever, you have the chance to watch this movie. If you have to chop off your arm, you will see it. It is worth it .. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The bus is unlike any movie you've ever seen. It takes garbage cinema and elevates it to a work of art. It contains bad attitudes, idiotic characters, bad dialogues, strange spectacles, and cinematography that are made public in Iowa, but it's actually a film target. The goal is to be the dumbest, strangest and most incredible movie you've ever seen. And, boy, it always works. <br /> <br /> I will interpret the plot for those of you who are concerned about such things (the filmmakers obviously have not), but you do not have to pay much attention to it. The entire plot of the movie is presented in a very long text, which is played before the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is a bus tour of Chicago led by Satan. You know, Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers in the bus are supposed to die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except when Jesus is in the city, a footman in hell breaks off the job, and that makes Satan angry Well 'He does not like to look like a fool in front of the guy, so he decides to get people on the bus to sign their souls directly with him, but he's a devil, so he has to dress up, or who else would go on tour, so he disguises himself as Roger and gets on the bus, where the driver is never named, but he's kind of fat, so he's probably fat. The bus (and the drivers) are on a collision course with Wackiness! <br /> <br /> Examples of madness: The title is repeated three times on the screen. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus with no explanation or introduction and occasionally sits next to the others and they look at her as if she does not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange wistful looks. These are really the same settings that are repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan has given a one-minute monologue on the transformation into human form, a title card flashes, "Satan will change." I do not know why. A character is a woman who is obviously a man on the train and is referred to by other characters as "the glamorous Bridget". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer, I got my own version of Fatty Drives The Bus.
