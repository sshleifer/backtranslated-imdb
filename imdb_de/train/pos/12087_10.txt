I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying Amazon's first season (Canadian release). When I got it, I started with the pilot and was immediately impressed. I rated it at Amazon with 5 stars, and I rate it here with 10 stars. It's just so good. What I liked were the opening and closing motifs and of course the logo of Stephen J. Cannell at the end of each episode, but most of all the relationship between the judge and Mark working together to solve each case. I was so excited that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I liked it just as much. If you do not have this great show on CD, I think you should buy it and include it in your collection.
