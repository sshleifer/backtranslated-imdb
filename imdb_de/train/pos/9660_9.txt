Only after some thought, I decided that I liked this movie. And after reading the comments of all the other posters here and thinking more about them, I decided that I liked it a lot. I love American movies - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it's too artistic. In every respect, this film is to awaken your sensory memories. Throughout the movie, you feel like you're there ... you feel the summer sun, the breeze, the heat, the winter cold, the company, the loneliness, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In every sense The director draws you into the life of the characters - so many people feel so strong that the movie has disappointed them. After seeing it, I felt the same way. After some deliberation, I realized that the movie had to be like this: The 'story' is not the narrative, it's the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, the scenery, and the camera angle immerse you in the scenes - they are rich, exquisite and live with details and nuances. Although I usually can not watch movies without a full-fledged storyline (after all, it's not "a movie" to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
