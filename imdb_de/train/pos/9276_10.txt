The US Secretary of State does not want us to see this movie because he has beef with the Iranian government. However, it does show us how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on women's struggle for equality in the simplest sense: the possibility of pursuing a football match in the stadium, which is strictly limited to only male audience. The film is funny and in itself a proof of the freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I really enjoyed this movie. Five girls try to break the police limits on tickets to a football game between Iran and Bahrain. The ensuing comedy is too funny to describe, from the bus ride to the stadium to the intervention of the police and the subsequent imprisonment of the girls until the end. Do not miss this classic movie. You must have seen something like that. One of the best foreign films I have seen in years.
