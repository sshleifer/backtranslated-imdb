one of the best low budget films from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new age? If you believe in esotericism, please do not watch this movie! it blows away all your positive fantasies. This film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of seeking spiritual souls lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope there will be a 35mm copy soon! Andreas Marschall's first film is only the beginning of a new section that makes films with a few euros! I am waiting for the second goal!
