I always follow the Dakar, and when my husband bought Charlie's DVD "Race to Dakar" home, I could not wait to see her. Of course, we had seen the transfer of the race when the actual race took place, but that never gives the background and the specific teams. If you've seen Long Way Round, you will not be surprised The language, which I honestly find amusing rather than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he styled it in front of Dakar, so my feminine need for neatness was alleviated. I could have lived without the 'flames' underwear. As with LWR, preparation was as interesting as the race. I nearly cried when Charlie broke his hand and winced at every bruise he suffered during training ... and of course the death of Andy Caldicott ... that was a terrible tragedy, but then there's something every year , <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, though his attitude has improved a thousand times over the argumentative cynic he had in the LWR. It's great that he's doing so well with Charlie now. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was: 1. Do not let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for EVERYTHING! - They had months to prepare for the X5, and the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion had done half of the things that needed to be done, and the car was a pain throughout the race; 2. The Dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their driver / driver recovery plan - and Matt (and probably a large number of other drivers / drivers to skip drying as they did was nothing less than culpable negligence; Charlie) has a love of 'rough and tough' adventures, but he has to do a lot to really play the way he wants, and finally 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another epic called Long Way Down (2007) ) I can not wait to get hold of it !: D If you love bikes and / or really nice guys trying, you need to watch this, I guarantee you love it. It is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> In conclusion to Simon Pavey - you are a hero, I was so impressed by your 'quiet performance' and the fact that you were actually finished ..... just amazing, considering what And for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full marks for having managed to believe that a relatively green team could have achieved so much - is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
