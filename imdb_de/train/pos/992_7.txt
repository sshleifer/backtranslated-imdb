I had no expectations; I had never heard of Jamie Foxx. I just knew that the movie has some strong character actors. I found it very entertaining; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to protect my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is great (that's right, that's not his best role). I thought the car chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the movie and were well done. I did not expect much and was happily surprised.
