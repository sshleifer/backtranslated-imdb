This was one of the funniest and best sitcoms that hit national television. It's unfortunate that the show is not one of the big sitcoms where she really belongs. The actors did an excellent job, and seasons 1 through 6 were the show's climax. Although the seventh season was not so good compared to the previous six years, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem. Without Topher Grace or Ashton Kutcher the show just fell apart. Not to say the other actors were not great when one of the two main characters like Danny Masterson, Wild Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great) were left showing that it would have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either, because he was not well received by the show fans. I think if the show ended a year ago, she would surely have gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the final was excellent. I'll miss the show, I just hope I wake up one day to find out that the show is back as That 80's show with the same cast because I'm out hell.
