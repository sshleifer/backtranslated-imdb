Robot Jox makes a great effort, but is basically a series of battle scenes lined up - robots versus robots, man against man, man against woman. The premise had potential, but it seemed the script did not really get the few other designs it needed. Still, it was pretty good for a sci-fi action movie. Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those unfamiliar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel The Forever War. With Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor" it is considered one of the best battle armor novels. And this movie is more like a huge powered battle armor movie than a giant robot. It's closer to what the fans would have wished for, rather than the travesty that was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" and that had only a passing resemblance to the novel it's based on. This is not really true despite some assumptions. It is not based on Homer's "Iliad". They all have a few names in common. Achilles, who blew his robot's foot, had no parallel in the Iliad that did not include Achilles death. Old Achilles was not a noble warrior either. He was the most powerful, but also vengeful and petty. Even the robot jock that was killed in the first scene does not fit. He was called Hercules, while the Greek Iliad had had Heracles. The effects were pretty good for the time and budget. It was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but the movie cost ten times as much. The stop movement was almost as good as the robot wanderers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Better than many Ray Harryhausen animations, which are highly regarded but quite old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> Do not bring high expectations, and you probably will not be disappointed. It's better than many other low-budget gimmicks and even some big blockbuster wannabes who have better effects but far worse scripts.
