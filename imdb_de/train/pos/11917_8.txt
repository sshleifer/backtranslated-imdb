Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end, when the whole crowd gets up in the stadium and people raise their hands, gives me a cool when I see it. That's just awesome. Joseph is wonderful as a lonely and sad boy who has never been disappointed by anyone in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is fun and exciting. A very nice family movie with - I admit - a rather cheesy happy ending. But hey, that does not matter, the movie retains its basic quality through good acting and inspirational themes.
