The sopranos are probably the biggest show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that offers so much intelligence, sublime writing or first-rate performances. <br /> <br /> In all areas epic scope produces fresh and iconic character and consistently high quality. To the life of a Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two children's families, the other a huge group of New Jersey mafia of which he is the boss of both. Tony is a fascinating, sinister, but likable guy, played by James Gandolfini, by True Romance and The Mexican Fame. Gandolfini must be praised for turning a female and terribly aggressive villain into a truly identifiable and perfect leader. The American drama Contemporay has never had such a spectacular and iconic character as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds never has a flat performance and such outstanding characters as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will be remembered forever. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this story, however, is that the creator and writer embraces courage and revolution on a conventional drama series. Twenty-minute dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery, and truly shocking scenes of violence. We encounter all this style with really touching themes like love, honor and respect for the family. The series never gets cold-hearted or unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Competitive and often poor television The sopranos are the most original and convincing drama in America. Forget the family redefined. This is television redefined.
