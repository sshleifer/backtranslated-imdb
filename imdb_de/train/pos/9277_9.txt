"Cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and prolific directors of the day, at last year's Romanian Anonimul Film Festival, which was in its third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the directional prize went to Jafar Panahi's "Offside". I saw it in Bucharest this evening at the retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead, but still very lively. Panahi's film tells convincingly how Iranian society looks like. Turned digitally, "Offside" is a story inspired by an event that occurred to Panahi's daughter in reality: the effort and risk of attending a football match was high. This is forbidden in Iran, as we are informed. What Panahi manages is to portray the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a certain level, with few resources, but probably a lot of work, intelligence and humor. The absurdity of the laws becomes funny. The film has a happy ending, because the Iranian team is going to the World Cup. What I liked most was the concept, the idea behind this film. I would be very interested to see Panahi's other films, which were banned in Iran. I think he can be thought of as an activist director.
