The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. When I see this movie now (2005), I find that it does not really fit into the genre of films that came out in the early '90s. I do not think it can be a film noir, but it is sometimes quite dark, mainly because of the lighting and strange characters of the characters actors who have all done a good job with their roles. However, I thought that the characters of Hopper and Boyle were not developed because it was sometimes hard to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. Hopper loves him or hates him. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand them over to the director (ie, when he sees the sheriff for the first time). All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
