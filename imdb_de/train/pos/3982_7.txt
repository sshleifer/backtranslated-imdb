This short Joe McDoakes theme was evidently inspired by the spectacular Thank Star Lucky Stars of All Star Warner Brothers, one of the wartime all-star war starters. In this Eddie Cantor played both himself and a comedian who would like to immerse himself in movies, apart from his resemblance to Cantor. George O'Hanlon, who played in the McDoakes shorts, is both himself and McDoakes, who is trying to get a break in the film. Like Thank Your Lucky Stars, a few Warner Brothers players strolled through this movie with a free moment. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon's was sent by Central Casting for a small role in a World War I movie. Lookalike McDoakes receives the message. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment that he's wondering how he can reach his only line. Maybe that sounds like a real movie star. <br /> <br /> 86 later leads to the irritation of director Ralph Sanford and the patient Clyde Cook, who plays a British Cockney soldier who finds a niche in the movie business for poor McDoakes. It is worthwhile to see this very funny short topic that has been nominated for an Oscar to find out what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
