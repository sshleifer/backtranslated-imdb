The fall of the scorpion is a very stylish giallo, led by Sergio Martino, who appears to be a giallo champion behind Dario Argento. Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous, insane, rather complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, because that's not always the case with these giallos, as their endless red pegs and ultimate solutions tend to increase their credibility. The less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> Pure Giallo trademarks are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the beautiful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloves, murderers and explicit sex scenes, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> Most of the acts are decent, Goerge Hilton is generally polite and others are doing quite well. Martino leads with a sure hand, keeping things tight and atmospheric with some great standards. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Giallo, this is a must. If you like well-written and thrilling thrillers in general, this is highly recommended.
