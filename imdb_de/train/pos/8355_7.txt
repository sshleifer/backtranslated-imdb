The film has a pronounced (albeit brutal and harsh) humanity for all border areas of depravity - the funky / lyrical score features the weird side of their mishaps, and even when they are the worst (like terrorizing the woman on the train)), one half miserable vulnerability never lurks far (Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby). Blier cuts off the scene in which Depardieu could rape Dewaere. So we're never sure how to explicitly read the obvious homoerotic aspect of their relationship - in both cases, this incident is certainly the beginning of their relative humanization (the film might do that) Everything you want to read can be read. The film has many reprehensible scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best understood as a general cartoon about the weaknesses of both sexes, mocking the whole concept of sensitivity and honesty and making numerous points of possible profundity on this basis when you fire enough shots, Some of them are necessarily hit.
