The "Men in White" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest comedy movies I've ever seen! (And I've been watching a lot!) These are two coachmen who become Men in White and then stop an invasion from outer space. It is also a parody of many classic films like Men in Black, Star Wars or Dr. Strangelove. Whoever says that this movie is crappy does not have something with his head. There are lots of funny jokes and jokes, and you could actually hurt yourself if you laugh too much (that happened to me!). If you can see this movie on TV, look at it now - you certainly will not regret it!
