The documentation begins by setting the perspective for several light-years. The Voyager travels with the sounds of our earthly life on our Milky Way galaxy as a space monument for (possible?) Extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains footage of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J. B. Lenoir. The footage of J. B. has never been published. The story is from 'blind Willie' Dixon. It is, however, made by an actor. The film shows the work of all these early Blues men, followed by cover and interpretations of musicians like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. <br /> <br /> The death of J. B. Lenoir (John Mayall's Song) is a striking event in history. Lenoir became politically engaged and is considered the league of Martin Luther King and his colleagues. His political interests can be found in the themes of his texts. <br /> <br /> Blues is considered America's "native" music. Blues is the root and the rest are the fruits. <br /> <br /> The title "Soul of a Man" is after a Willie Dixon song.
