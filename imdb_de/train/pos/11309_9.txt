A masterful treatment by James Caines "The Postman Rings Twice Twice" when Luchino Visconti's first film was filmed mainly near Ferrara in a soulless, war-torn Italy. The original negative was considered destroyed, but Visconti has saved a print, and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed their breasts in "La Cena delle beffe" (1941)) are the sensual and unhappy lovers who want to kill their husband. Unusual ending, though crime does not pay, one pays in a way that is not directly related to the crime. Excellent directing, script, drama and cinematography. Allegedly not as good as the French "Le Dernier Tournament" (1939), but probably better than the US Version (1946)) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles, highly recommended.
