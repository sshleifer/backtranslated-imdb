When I sat in the cinema, I was in a cool mood and I did not mean to change it. But this film is a dramatic powerhouse. I was all sweaty and needed a shower afterwards. So what do we have? Theoretically an adult story of a Turkish teenager girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It occurred to me that the plot seemed pretty much borrowed from "Bend It Like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing football and destroying her sister's wedding. Here we have transferred it to a Turkish girl who spoils her brother's wedding with Kung Fu. And of course we also have a love story and a contest. After accepting this, it turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama that showed a beautiful kung fu (although I'm not an expert). Leading actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion, she also delivers an outstanding performance, so it's safe to assume that we have some autobiographical impressions here, considering that this is her first film and she's not an actress. The rest of the minor cast is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Side Notes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect, so it must have done something right. - The audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally defended herself and attacked the boys who beat her brother out of revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese kung fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon), starred in the lead role. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this in the cinema, you have probably done so. A good and intense experience, and I do not know if this works on small screens either
