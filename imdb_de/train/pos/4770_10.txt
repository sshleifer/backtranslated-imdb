The only show I have seen since 90210! Why did you stop it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like part of everything! At least you should publish it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I watched similar shows, but nothing came closer. The cast had incredible chemistry and I was looking forward to every episode with great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake when they showed this show. If anyone has information about where I can get a DVD from North Shore, please post a few lines here. Many Thanks! Aloha!
