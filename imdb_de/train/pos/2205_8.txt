Their average psychotic nut box from the garden variety (deliciously discussed with undisguised joy by Stephen Sachs) beats at the Dayton Hall University, which is closed for demolition, various, stunned young "adults" (to use the term very loosely). With dreadful spectacle of the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga debuts here as Debbie, a Bimbo who has crushed her head off a car!), A juicy and painful 10-Mungle movie debut, a couple of bloody murders (baseball bat, chicken wire strangulation, standard drill through the head, this kind of cruel thing), a surprising surprise ending, later in "Intruder", a scary score by Christopher ("Hellraiser") Young, a small piece of unbiased female nudity and endearing incompetent directing by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter ( who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), these entertaining, vile Slice'n'Dice abominations are a lot of delicious and dirty inferior fun.
