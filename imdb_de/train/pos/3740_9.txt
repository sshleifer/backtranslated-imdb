While being shot on a Florida National Guard website, "Tigerland" reminded me of Fort Polk, Los Angeles, shooting ranges, maneuvering zones, waist-deep water, and everything else. The movie was pretty authentic and the characters were similar to those on my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year 1971 and mine of 1974 are all sergeants and instructors who knew they would not return to Vietnam. It was pretty much over So the training was very relaxed - no challenge. That was the precursor to all our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I know until 2004. I've never heard anyone mention "Tigerland," but the army had realistic Vietnam practice villages at various bases in the United States. Vietnam veterinarians tell me that Basic & AIT could be quite rough and robust until 1972, when the instructors were there and were instructed to train Vietnam-bound men with these skills, although this was not always the case. Both as Drill Sergeant in Polk and later as one of my NCOs in Vietnam Vet, when we became a basic training brigade instructor at Fort Bliss, they told me that they could do nothing to prepare for themselves. This film is high rated.
