Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time," one of the many Merrie tune cartoons that entertain American moviegoers during World War II, features a hobo flea that has settled on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little guy becomes a true sadist while making a home on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog, "Another scwatch and I'll bathe you!" In the meantime, the flea is building dynamite for the dog! * And that's not the end! I've noticed Elmer reading a comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig in one scene. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs have often starred, but Elmer has never shared a role with Porky (unless you count the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, the notion that Elmer read about these other famous characters from the same genre, the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of their existence in his universe, although it does not appear in this cartoon. <Br /> <br /> Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon was meant to be pure entertainment and certainly entertains. As for the line "I may like it," this sounds like the censors did not allow it, but somehow missed it; I do not know how it sounds. Was it something sexual? Had I thought I had seen everything, I would have been tempted to seek more than to do what the cat did (though it was a decent trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons certainly had something for TNT, right?
