The 1928 Russian director of emigrants in Hollywood (William Powell) throws his epic on the Russian Revolution and hires a former ex-general of the Czarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the general of the film The Memory of the Woman (Evelyn Brent) of eleven years. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Try as best I could, it's hard to warm "The Last Command" for all its virtues. Undoubtedly, "The Docks of New York" was a great movie, and "Underworld" is a movie I've always wanted to see, but "The Last Command" is pretty cumbersome. The premise is intriguing, but the treatment really brings the script to life, except in the Hollywood-themed sequences that show the limit of usable extras and the machinations of a major movie production using the latest technology. <Emil Jannings is probably a wonderful Russian general who wonderfully distinguishes between the traumatized and rundown old ex-general, who is banished in his misery, and the vigorous, cordial officer of yore. <br /> <br /> The end is great and worth the wait, but to get there you have to be bored.
