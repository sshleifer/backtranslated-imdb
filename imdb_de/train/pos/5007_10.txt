The first TV special by Barbra Streisand was just fantastic! From her sketch as a child to her songs in a high-end department store - everything was top notch! It was easy to understand how this special was awarded. <br /> <br /> Not disturbed by guest appearances, Barbra remained in focus throughout the production.
