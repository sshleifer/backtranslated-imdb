If you loved Long Way Round, you will enjoy it almost as much. It is instructive, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen, and too much Russ. Ewan does some gigs, but Charley really does it alone. He is funny, captivating and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series consists of 7 episodes. As with LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they well cover the specifics of the race, there could be something more to the trucks and cars that are just mentioned and rarely even seen in racing. It's a motorcycle movie though, and anyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series features stunning photography as well as some interviews with people's mouths. Yikes There's another, very catchy title song like LWR, but this song is not nearly as good as the stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the USA, God knows when it will come look it up on your computer. Oh, and be ready to buy another bike.
