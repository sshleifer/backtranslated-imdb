Another Spanish film about the civil war of 1936. This time we tell the story of Carol (beautifully played by debutante Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village in New York. It is such an inaugural journey, and soon she will learn about the injustices of humanity, their stupid struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photograph and a beautiful script. He tries not to participate in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are clear enough to let us decide which band we are in) and he uses the presence and the Presence of the band Freshness of the young couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-maintained production. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
