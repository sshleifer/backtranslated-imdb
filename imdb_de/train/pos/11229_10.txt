With the number of actors working on the project, they have a variety of actors. Nice spaceship CGI in places, BUT her green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to make their keying better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out and contain many trek elements to get the context right. BUT BUT the idea that two guys are kissing makes me move the episode forward. I am not homophobic, but I can not help that I do not find men kissing entertainingly (do not worry about women). In any case ... that's good stuff for a fan series. With minor improvements in its green screen, refresh and some benchmarks, this series is breathtaking. However, I recommend this series to anyone who has ever enjoyed TNG and DS9.
