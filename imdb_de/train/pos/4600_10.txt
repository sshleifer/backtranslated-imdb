It's sad that this movie is the best that should be here in at least the 250 best movies. This is still the best action movie ever. The action movies of today are badly done. The actors and action directors do not know how to properly fight and do stunts. just not some, as you mostly do from Hong Kong, like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so smart and wild, I do not think we'll ever see such a thing. The start on which Chan and his team hunt hill hunting through the hilltop town is simply unbelievable. The final combat stunts are for me the best fighting stunts ever made. The last stunt that slid down the pole and crashed through the glass was badly injured.
