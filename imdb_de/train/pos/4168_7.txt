This movie has not only one of the big movie titles, but also the third team of 70's children actor Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to recall that this movie aired on Halloween Week '78 when he arrived in our house against Linda Blair in Stranger. I missed it on the first run when I chose the other movie. At the repetition, I later saw that I had made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but there are really no showers or surprises. Although I liked the scene in which Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​without success.
