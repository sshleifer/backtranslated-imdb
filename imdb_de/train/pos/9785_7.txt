Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on that :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and saw him to the end. It's one of those "Dramas of Life" movies, as my mother called a movie that is a real life story with no extraordinary events and is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too much guilt, but without too much credit. I longed for something like The Interview, or at least a Matrix villain element here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. History teaches you how to face your own destiny and free oneself from the environment others are building for you, but this happens when the life-sustaining peach plant in the area is about to close. <br /> <br /> The "smart" American Beauty sound-like song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but it was just this ever-playing song that got annoying after 100 minutes of filming. <br / In the end, it was probably his job to present a part of Australian life, but it did not seem particularly Australian to me (it could have been placed somewhere) and it did not seem to be attractive story. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be in a certain mood to like the movie.
