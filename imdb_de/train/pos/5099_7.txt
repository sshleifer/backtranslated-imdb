The only reason I came across this movie was that it's on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it, though you do not find it as good as the more famous movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as cheaters and his companion. The film starts fairly easily, but becomes more dramatic as Coop first plans to blackmail his daughter with a substantial amount of money from his brother-in-law, but when he saw the girl and saw the discipline that she would submit to his brother -in-law choose to keep her. Nevertheless, he has difficulty staying on the narrow and narrow path, and so the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in. There is little music in this and Shirley only has one song. However, this is entertaining and worth seeing along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
