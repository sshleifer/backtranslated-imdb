"Iphigenie" is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful game is masterfully adapted to the canvas and brought to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy without losing its effectiveness and importance. A stellar Greek occupation helps him. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenie. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who, although sometimes overblown, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek movie, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music by Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal in any scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumor has it that the film lost the best foreign-language film Oscar with just one vote !!!
