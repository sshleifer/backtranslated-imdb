Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely enjoyable story, and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsales Emma is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good script and great cinematography) is able to produce the comedy effectively, she can not sympathize with Emma. Paltrow is not supported by the fact that her hairstyles for the role are simply "wrong" (and I believe the era), and she looks positively ill in the clothes of the Empire line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, easily manages the comedy and can still show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a splendid Mr. Knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, decent age, chivalry, compassion and gentleness. Emma and Mr. Knightly are supported by a number of good actors, and the overall production is very pleasing.
