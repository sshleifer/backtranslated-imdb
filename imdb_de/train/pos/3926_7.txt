Plotwise, this is a pretty stupid little idiot masquerading as a time drama / biopic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I ever wanted to see it was that I was curious what the great Henry Fonda really was like at its peak. I was not disappointed - it delivers a really warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> Also, I can honestly say that at no time during the movie was I bored, so a strong *** 1/2 off *****
