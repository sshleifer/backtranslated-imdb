This movie has everything. Emotion, strength, affection, Stephane Rideau's enchanting, naked beach dance ... It reveals the need for true inner communion and communication in every respect. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay does not mean that there is no useful insight for anyone with something. I would probably classify it as a gay movie that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to cope with his feelings betrays that our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this leads to disagreement between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must !!!!
