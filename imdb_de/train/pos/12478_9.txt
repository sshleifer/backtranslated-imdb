What a lovely, heartwarming TV movie. The story is about a little five-year-old girl who has lost his father and finds it impossible to cope with it. Her mother is also very desperate. Only a miracle can relieve their misfortune. The hope of all spectators will show. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the little girl's mother, as she was as "Nanny" in "Jack and Sarah". It's worth seeing if you like both Samantha Mathis and Happy. Year wanking films! Ellen Burstyn is as always a delightful grandmother in this delicate and awesome movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five-year-old) is charming and a convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching: "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human goodness that is clearly illustrated and clearly around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope that they realize that there are many lovable people in the world who give a lot of love. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
