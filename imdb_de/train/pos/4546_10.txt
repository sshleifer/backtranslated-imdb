This movie will go down in history as one of the greats, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo that has not been seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will reassure you. Dingman's character as a buffoonish fool goes back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the highlight. Gosh, the highlight. I will not ruin it for you, but the explosion of the Death Star fades in comparison. If you can find this hard-to-find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it right away. I still have hope for a special edition DVD.
