This thriller is something of a film noir, though it changes the context from the postwar war to the cold war and has something relatively decent about humanity to say. In "Pickup on South Street," policemen are good men, criminals are real men, and the only enemies are "The Commies," who ultimately differ from the good guys by being emotionally sympathetic and driven by a genuine caring for their own worth as shown in the constantly watched close-ups that speckle the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is about characters. The personalities in this film are quite unique and detailed: skip the tote bag, which is able to look at any danger, and sometimes, while going through their personal belongings; Moe the informer, trying to save himself for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all other characters (and the audience); Candy, the poorly named innocent girl, who only believes she does government work and does not quite understand the plot she is involved in; and Joey, the ex-boyfriend, the evil Commie villain who tries to hide everything from everyone, and ironically, he's the worst person. Throw a bunch of colorful characters (like the guy with the chopsticks and the cops) and "Pickup on South Street" with a wealth of personalities as you hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. > <br /> - PolarisDiB
