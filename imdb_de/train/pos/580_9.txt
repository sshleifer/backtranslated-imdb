When I saw this movie for the first time, I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because he was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river flows through It's about two brothers, each going a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and is on the way to training. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother on the road full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters as everyone follows their own path. <br /> <br /> This film has no disadvantage. They will talk all the way through. The acting, director and script is all perfect. The two things that are extraordinary are the cinematography and the score. Both captivate you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is an all-round movie that should become a classic. It's safe in my book. If you have not seen this movie, be sure to watch it as soon as possible, as it will stay with you forever.
