Passing Stones definitely one of the best independent comedy films of all time. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy it. This movie did not get his credit due for some reason. Let's start with the plot first. Everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters pointing to a hidden treasure, he not only brings two families together, but begins a whirlwind adventure. Mixing up in a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a crackhead with turrets syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and a drag queen, money not only gets the world going, but makes family enemies. My favorite character in this movie must be the sister / crack addict with turret syndrome. Your sudden outburst will mimic you for weeks.
