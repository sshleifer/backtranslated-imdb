"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father remarried. After her father's death, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and had her do all the housework, as if she was cleaning after her two wicked stepsisters. One day the king sent a message to all single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella was not allowed to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very excited and thought that she could not attend the Royal Ball until her fairy godmother appeared. She conjured and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight as the magic changes again. At the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time and the clock strikes midnight. She runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the king orders the Duke to find the women who wore this slipper. The Duke ransacked every house, but eventually found the wives to which he belonged, Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske produced one of the best animated Disney movies of 1950. This movie is about a magical fairy tale. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a servant of her own family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic, her whole life changed and eventually found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite activity "Cinderella" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy appeared her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing in my house. I'll never forget it. I also loved the role as Cinderella and the prince sang the song So This is Love as they danced, realizing they were in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a little kid, because every little girl wants to lead a fairytale life.
