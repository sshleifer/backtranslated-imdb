I can not understand that so much garbage from Norway has been remastered for the DVD release, and gems like this have no chance to regain their past glory. I give this a 7, not because it's very good, but because it's one of the few sci-fi movies made for Norwegian television. This movie is nothing short of a film-historical gem that anticipates the first alien movie in many ways. And my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the miniseries? However, it is unlikely that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay, the budget is much lower in Norwegian film, but considering that, it's a really well-made work from the desolate era of Norwegian film, which, by the way, lasted until the 1990s.
