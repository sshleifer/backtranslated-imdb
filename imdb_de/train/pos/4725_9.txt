Despite the lack of logic in the plot, Kill Shot is a very entertaining movie. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien portrays the emotional gap between a hard-working, wealthy father and his misguided son. Each member of the minor cast plays with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid drama of a young Asian man whose name I can not remember. A frighteningly tragic end may unsettle some younger viewers, but Kill Shot really does kill.
