I am totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the week passes to see the next show. It's a great story and it has the best actors and actresses on the show. I will turn on every week to see it, even if I'm not home. I have always set my video recorder to tape Monarch Cove. Simon Rex is the best actor in the show. it's exciting and exciting. I think this show should stay in the air, and I think everyone should come in to see them. I saw the very first episode and did not really want to watch it, but one day I watched it all my life and decided to watch it because it was on and I absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show. I really mean it.
