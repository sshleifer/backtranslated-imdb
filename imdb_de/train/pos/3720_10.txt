Joel Schumacher has chosen this cast and this script. The story is well written and concise and this all-new cast of 10 or 12 key characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed there were 6 "leads" and about half a dozen support, and this is by far the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since Hollywood touched on the controversial Vietnam War movies, which says something about the "story that had to be told" (as stated by Schumacher) and the Tigerland countries in this handful of top war film era. However, it can not be called a war movie because it was more based on the human spirit of Bozz and the others. I think, anyone who just wants to see a good movie with all the special effects, but only good, hearty drama should visit Tigerland, obviously Shumacher's best works of the last 8 years.
