I'll always have a thing for this Disney strip, another part of it that shows live action and animation contributions to replicate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never quite make it. When I was in elementary school, every now and then we had a film day where the entire school crowded into the cafeteria, and a movie was projected in an old-fashioned way, several roles, and so on. At the time it seemed to be a significant opportunity whenever that day arrived, and Bedknobs and Broomsticks is one of the films I can remember. <br /> <br /> And as far as I can remember, it's pretty charming. Angela Lansbury has never gotten her name to something that was at least not competent, and she wins here as a witch with a magic bed (boy, that could be misunderstood, right?), Who can take her and a couple of young children to magical Adventure to far away places. Come on, which kid would not want a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Note: A
