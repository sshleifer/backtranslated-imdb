Robert Mitchum plays as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional city tamer - as in when a city needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought to it. Tollinger's latest appearance comes as a coincidence: he strolls into the city and looks for his former momentum. He stumbles into a city that is played by a western gangster like a puppet. But many townspeople begin to feel ashamed the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of tidying the city becomes very tiring (suddenly, High Plains Drifter looks less original). <br /> <br /> Man With The Gun starts off as the average Western Hard Guy movie, but starts to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What begins as an unforgettable and normal, ends dark and character. The whole movie is shot very well and the cast is fun. Mitchum is in Man With The Gun's usual self-confidence - not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective hard screen presence in the hustle and bustle of the movie straight out of the park. Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and worth the time.
