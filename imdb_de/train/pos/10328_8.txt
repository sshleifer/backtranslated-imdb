The makers chose the best people for the job and staged the scene beautifully. Every interior is full of details that tell you everything about the people who live in it. Whether it is about the 1920s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for middle history or the 1910s (the last ones), costumes and scenery are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace, superimposed by the finest shetland towels. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but no matter the young, in love lovers. Raymond Huntley is the man who annoys his wife's health and independence, shaking our feelings. He used to play weird, pompous types, but here he is subtle, persuasive and very impressive. The China Seas (great movie of the '30s with Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also a story by Kipling). I wish we had seen more of Naunton Wayne than the jealous husband - though he has a good moment that looks melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love this noble bird who also plays his wife.
