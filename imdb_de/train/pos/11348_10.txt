I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I saw it. It was not funny to me. I totally identified with the characters. I would like to see it again (and hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really involved in the fantasy world. And for me the movie was boring. I wonder if I have ever seen and confused the series? The acting thought I was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. To a 10 year old he was so dreamy (when I saw the movie for the first time, not 1970. I can still vividly remember the characters, the flute was absolutely believable and I can still "feel" the evil forest. I would not want to cross their path.
