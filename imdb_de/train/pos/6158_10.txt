What can I say about a story like this? This magical story followed me from my early childhood and has awakened warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to so many whimsical places that you want more from every scene. For example, there were so many different types of lore on the market. I loved the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The plot was wonderful. I wanted Landsbury so much that he decided to keep the precocious kids, and that she should stay with Mr. Brown as well. Find the other half of the spell so the men of less armor can win the war. <br /> <br /> I am still a child, and this film appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my absolute favorite of all time. I hope that all children can see and be carried away by this classic and be transported to another time.
