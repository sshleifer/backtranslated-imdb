Generally I like some light and fun, so I should not have liked this movie. But it grabbed me from the start. The story of a family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but it keeps asking the question, "What if it was my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what those involved felt. It was difficult to see in places, but more difficult to avert. The story is true and life is sometimes hard to see! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: A good story is already a good story. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. As in real life, you really do not know what's going to happen next, or why people are doing the things they do!
