Most Atomic-era monster movies I saw on television as a kid - and some, including THE BLOB, have scared the daylight. In films like INVADERS FROM MARS, "little boys" were made all too clear to us that children should not be trusted when it comes to things that have invaded the homeworld. THE BLOB just repeated that fact. I like to remember late evenings stretched out on the floor to watch Body Snatchers and Marsian Invaders and Blobs infiltrate an unsuspecting party. In the early 1980s, there was a summer when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) held a nuclear-themed class every weekend. These were 16mm movies, and most were black and white (and the projector was loud), and the "color print" of THE BLOB faded to a faint pink - but, man, it was fun. I brought my mother and she enjoyed it as much as I did. There, in this science museum, I really fell in love with THE BLOB. The intention of the filmmaker was, of course, to make money - but it was the sincerity of everyone involved, from the filmmakers to the "talents" (the players) who fell in love with this movie. Cheesy? You bet Cheesig? They do not become cheesier. But man, what a movie!
