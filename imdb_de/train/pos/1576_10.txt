That was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the movie for a long time. I think every student should see this movie so he can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because it showed me and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be so strong as a woman. I really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the film to The Downfall, The Pianist. When you put together these three films, you have a good overview of what happened in the war. We should always remember something like the war.
