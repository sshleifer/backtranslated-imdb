After hearing pretty positive reviews and watching the trailer, I had to watch this movie. It presented itself well with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell. And it has delivered. Overall, the film is not funny, but there is a scene that really stands out and in my eyes is a classic. SPOILER In the end, as they break through the wall to get to the safe, and we see Rockwell and Washington Jeter staring, it's just fantastic. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where The Dude uses a chair to close his door, but forgets that the door is turning outward! END SPOILER Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
