"Life hits us in the face ........ we must try to stay beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut film by one of Belgium's best artists (he sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited film and - a happy, happy joy for Flemish filmmaking - really worth seeing and a promising piece of work! It leads us into the life of 8 main characters who live through Friday and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float on the party on Friday night, where they meet somehow. Excellent use of music. Sometimes it takes the upper hand to the pictures and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience because it is so filmed. It keeps you really good while playing in a small place with lots of people celebrating a big party ... so hard to spin. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Menij√®r Barman, for making this daring film in this bad years of Flemish filmmaking, which has been going on for several years. You saved my day!
