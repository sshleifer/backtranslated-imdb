I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite presenter of the show, no doubt. I hate celebrity gossip and generally do not object to talk shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, I absolutely had to watch TV. I rarely missed an episode during his run and was saddened when the innkeepers began to pour (though most of the guests were still doing a good job). <br /> <br /> For all those who do not like Hal Sparks, I can imagine that they have never seen the weekend specials. They were hours of Talk Soup episodes that featured the best clips in the entire week, and were filled with sketch comedy bits. The original pieces that Hal Sparks hired were hilarious. In one, he was possessed by a wicked comedy demon, and in an exorcist-like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about the food of airlines. One episode was dedicated to "Multiplicity," as a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks became more and more prevalent in the episode, and the studio overrun Describe them, but all I know is that besides Talk Soup, the only other shows I do In those years consistently saw The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comedy styling of these shows, you would probably like talk soup during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That said, Henson and Tyler were both great hosts. All three hosts brought something else to the table but in my opinion they were all good comedians. During the years of Tyler and the guest stars, my interest in the show began to diminish, but from time to time I catch The Soup, the show's spiritual successor, and the new presenter can bring quite unexpected laughs from time to time. <br /> <br /> OK, I've spent enough time talking about a TV show that's out of the air and a channel I generally despise. Look at something else!
