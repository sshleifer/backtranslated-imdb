An interesting view of Japan before opening to the west. John Wayne, America's first consul to Japan, comes in line with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne finally wins his meeting with the shogun after taking control of a cholera epidemic introduced by an American ship. This is followed by a colorful move to the capital-giving gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination attempt during an archery exhibition give an interesting insight into the politics of the time. All in all a pretty enjoyable movie and also how often you see the Duke losing a fight with a man of his size.
