For satires, 1933 seemed to be a great year ("Duck Soup" for example), and this fits well, even when it comes to the obsession with the contract bridge. The sound is appropriate as a humorous piece from the New Yorker, as the film begins with the "Goings On About Town" page of this magazine. The only strange thing is the casting. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy were perfect. After 1934, however, adultery would not have been treated in such a sophisticated way, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in jesting and creeping outfits, or a group of prostitutes on radio listening to a bridge contest. Even if you do not know about Bridge, you may want to see a rare example of Hollywood satire.
