Pabst's film, written just ten years after the actual events and playing in the bunker under the Reichstag, is gripping. It smells of sulphurous death awaiting the perpetrators of the World War. I have not seen this for over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The figures seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. A bit of dialogue between two generals: "Is there God?" "If he did, we would not do that." Too bad that this is not readily available for an exhibition or a purchase, as it would be interesting to compare this film with the documentary film about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" and "Untergang" with Bruno Ganz.
