Freebird is the perfect combination of road trip comedy, gear taper, "Stoner" movie and British feel-good movie. <br /> <br /> It is the brilliant leading actors who distinguish this film from other films of this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters extremely sympathetic and realistic. The main story revolves around her road trip from London to Wales and the adventures and mishaps that arise along the way. This little movie also has a great heart - not just for cycling fans, because it's based on the characters' relationships, including dreams and regrets, such as Fred Fred's Fred, who longs for the left-behind family. The cinematography is also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside and the loneliness of the streets of London and the typical pub life in the Welsh country towns funny story - I would recommend freebird immediately!
