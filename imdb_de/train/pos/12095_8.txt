When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a special bet. Without Poe's claim that all his macabre stories are based on actual experience, Foster accepts a bet by Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend all night in the Blackwood haunted mansion. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics approach him the anniversary of their death! The first time I saw this glorious classic horror, I was fascinated all the time. I found the movie really scary and sad at the same time. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terroristic. The topless scene threw me for a loop, as I did not expect it. It looks like Synapse has done a great job with the image enhancement because this movie looks damn good for its age, and it's the Uncut International version. This is the movie where I started a collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
