_Waterdance_ explores a variety of aspects of spinal cord injury. From the small torments of flawed fluorescent lights flashing over the head to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is revealed. The diversity of the central characters themselves underlines the complexity of the material studied - the writer Raymond, the black man with a grim past, and Bloss, the racist biker. Initially, these men are united by nothing but the nature of their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, a shared experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to support each other. The most obvious changes are those experienced by Joel, who initially distanced himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. While accepting the changes that the disability has caused in his life, Joel drops these props and begins to engage in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the station. The title is an indication of this daily struggle, the head to stay afloat. giving up dancing means refusing life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and I can recommend it without hesitation.
