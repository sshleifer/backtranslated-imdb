Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which ended in 2005, I had always considered this post from 1983 as my favorite feature of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and the really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forest creatures, etc.) made this film a particularly appealing film. <br /> <br /> None of the action ever focused too long on one spot. The last half hour illustrates this best as the scene changes every few minutes from forest to battle between spaceships to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another beautiful feature of this film The two predecessors had not done that because there was no fight between two of the stars. The constant argument between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford was over. After all, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was just a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
