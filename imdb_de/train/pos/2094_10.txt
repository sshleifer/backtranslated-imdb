Sure, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was shot. But other IMDB members, come on, this movie is certainly one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It's a 10th. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw in the New York Museum of Modern Art around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive looking, with scenes of such poverty, photographed masterfully, often exciting and always rousing, it was for me the MGM-Movie-Making of the finest. What did the audience feel when it saw a locust attack, the person through the destruction of a mansion, the terrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth. In the last week, the audience of the Academy Awards had an impression of the "older" Oscar-winner Luise Rainer. How awesome to see an actress who undoubtedly provided one of the most masterful and penetrating performances in history to choose a celebration. but do not blame Luise. Talkies were only a decade old when this was published, and their dialogue was limited. But as Olan, her use of visual and vocal matters is memorable. <br /> <br /> Big and touching, what more does a movie lover want?
