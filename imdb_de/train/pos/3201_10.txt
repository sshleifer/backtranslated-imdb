This is an early movie "pilot" for the successful Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to the executives of some networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a television series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this movie one of the best cult comedy films. The movie looks like these two little time criminals "exterminate" pets for money. If you have a dog next door that barks all night, these are the guys you go to! However, they run into trouble when they come across a job that is too big for them to handle. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> Rated R for cursing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's also not too offensive (they do not actually show killing animals).
