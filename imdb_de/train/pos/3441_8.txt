This film is incredibly realistic and I believe that the crime that many people do not understand due to a lack of experience is a great justice. The many people who think they can find out what is going through a victim's head are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson has done a fantastic job in her role as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This looks at rape from a different, more realistic standpoint than any other movie I've ever seen on the subject. The end was a bit long, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, because the chance of an attacker being jailed for a crime is about 1%. It's nice to see a movie closer to reality than most people would dare to do.
