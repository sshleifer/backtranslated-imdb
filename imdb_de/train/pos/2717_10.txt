I can not remember many details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was and that I was determined not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately we did not have a video recorder at the time, so I never saw the show again. But I can clearly remember how I felt and how thrilled I was every time it showed up. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he's still one of my favorite actors, mainly because of his performance on the show. I would like to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would do anything to see them again and see a long-gone childhood ... any ideas? Does anyone know about a site dedicated to the show, or did they record the episodes from the first broadcast?
