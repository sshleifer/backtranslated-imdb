The film is far more sophisticated and intelligent, exploring sexual tensions than such American attempts as 9 and a half weeks ... the court scene itself ... with the couple moving in the cage while the heroine asks for her orgasm. It's amazing ... I have not seen this movie for 20 years ... but it has made indelible images in my mind ... it's rich in textures and creates a world where sex is the engine of all activity, And at the bottom is the yawning fear that lives in all of us. The plot is European, and it snakes a bit, but life does too ... especially if you are 17 years old and are constantly hard ....
