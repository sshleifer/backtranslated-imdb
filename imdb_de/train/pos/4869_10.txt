Not for people without a quick mind or a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have one, you can not understand it. And if you do not understand it, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a Citroen-produced car, you'll probably see a painting by Picasso if you pass it and decide it's a street painter's rubbish truck. :) So do not judge before I try to understand it :) In the end, I think that it is a MUST for anyone who is open. My N1 The Shawshank Redemption remains! And remember that not all things can be put in frames. Because there are things in this world that every frame just does not fit.
