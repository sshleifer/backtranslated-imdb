I was never a big fan of TV until I first saw 24. I joined the series very late. The fifth season ended before I even saw my first episode. It was a Series 3 episode that was on my parents' DVR (Digital Video Recorder) box when I was in the house for a weekend. I needed this one episode to immerse myself in the world of Jack Bauer. And boy I was addicted !! I looked at the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly ticket for $ 20, and it's needless to say that it was the biggest blockbuster money I've ever spent. I saw the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty-minute episodes !!! I'll say it's easier on DVD to find out what's next than to wait an entire week. I can only imagine the expectation to watch Season 6 from week to week !! I find it mildly painful and cruel, but I will try and see it just like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I'm chumming at the piece !!
