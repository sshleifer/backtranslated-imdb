It's a road movie with a murderer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a mature, cosmopolitan writer, wants to conduct field research into American serial killers. However, neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), have the money for a tour of Mordorte, and they advertise that someone shares the travel expenses. In the end, they have a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliette Lewis), two better examples of "poor white garbage" that you'll never find in the entire movie theater. <br /> <br In fact, Early and Adele make this movie so entertaining as they babble, cackle, trust, muse, speculate, drool and behave the way I have since repeating "The Beverly Hillbillies" have seen more. Early's idea of ​​California: "People think out there faster because of the warm weather, cold weather makes people stupid". That's enough to convince Adele: "I think that explains why there are so many stupid people here." What Early proudly answers, "It sure does." Adele continues to be taught about California in the early days: "You never have to buy fruit at the expense of all the trees ... and there are no speed limits, and I hear your first month's rent is free, state law." <br /> <br /> But poor early has some good mental health problems that are becoming increasingly apparent to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers move west through the US, "California" is starting to feel more and more like "The Hitcher "(1986), and Early behaves more and more like John Ryder, any crazy hitchhiker whose terror seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> In "California," the spectacle is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, although he sometimes seems over the top. Michelle Forbes is great as an avant-garde photo artist. But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and her heavy southern accent she is stunning like the naive, strongly animated, childlike Adele. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the movie takes on a Twilight Zone feel. Our travelers enter a nuclear test field in Nevada with a rundown old house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves quite chaotically into unnecessary and absurd violence, an end that was a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, "California" is an entertaining film that, thanks to a sophisticated concept, has a great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue and the wonderful performance of Juliette Lewis.
