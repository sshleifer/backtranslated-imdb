I saw it on a plane to New Zealand last week and wondered how it would fare with the British movie and the book. I have to say, I was impressed. If anything, the fanatical commitment to the Red Sox in the lean years is even better than its original dedication to Arsenal, which has been successful over the years. As a Brit, I was also interested in seeing that you do not have to understand baseball to see what's going on. One question comes to mind: Was the script written with the Sox as a team before they finally broke the bastino's curse? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (weird, I know, a Brit who understands baseball), I have to say that it has contributed to enjoyment.
