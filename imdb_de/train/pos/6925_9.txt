Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a gun, a Winchester in a shooting contest. Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a poor loser and steals the weapon High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The rifle comes in different hands on the way. Will it return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and developed this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play the lead role. He was always the right man to do anything the role of Lola Manners and she is great as ever. Dan Duryea is great at Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly friend Steve Miller. Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point, the group is surrounded by Indians, as this is a western. It's great to see this survival game, where the fastest drawer and the hottest shooter is the winner. All true western fans will love this movie.
