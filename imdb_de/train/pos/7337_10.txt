Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious and that's a good thing. Anyone who likes Conan the Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The fight between good and evil is clear, even if our hero is sometimes neutral. In fantasy films, elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair, and goblins and orcs have dark skin and dark hair. Anyone familiar with Frazettas, Bakshi or even Tolkien's works knows that they are not racist. If you like fantasy movies, you should like this movie. It is not for little children due to violence and sexual innuendo. The casting was well done and the scenes and music are top notch. I hope someone will bring this gem to DVD soon. I am happy to have a VHS copy in good condition.
