Johny To does one of his best style exercises here and makes a strong movie with a good yakuza story. The election of the new Yakuza chief is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is used wisely, creating a very strong gang movie. I especially love how he tells the story, moves in all roles within Yakuza's family and makes us see the violence as if they could only solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Speech In terms of technical aspects, the film is a good example of a paused, rhythmic, and planned way to make a film. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year. It's like infernal affairs, but without the simple action-violence scenes and the confused action. Highly recommended for all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry for my English, better in Spanish lol)
