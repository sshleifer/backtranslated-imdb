Grand Canyon falls into a very rare category: It's a very smart movie with very skilful dialogues and food for thought from start to finish. I have the impression that it has never (never will) come to its deserved ranking because it is easy. This kind of movie needs sensitive observers. Too bad that IMDb forces me to write ten lines, because this is not necessary in this particular case. To answer this request, I tell you that the film's weak point, if anything, is acting: not that it's bad, but it could have been a lot better. Exception for Kevin Kline, who was perfect. Go ahead and watch.
