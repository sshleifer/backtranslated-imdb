I just came back from a pre-screening of this excellent science fiction movie. His style is definitely unique and very well done. It's filmed with real actors, but turned into a black and white comic style you've never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City and it feels good. It is a successful combination of French comic and film cultures. The story and the mood are reminiscent of Blade Runner, and if you like them, you will certainly like them too. The story is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. This movie is a must for any movie theater, except perhaps for those who absolutely do not like sci-fi or b / w.
