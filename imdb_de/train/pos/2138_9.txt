This film is as much about Japanese culture as it is about the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned upon by over 7 year olds (especially in public), so bows rather than embraces, even if you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom means to put your arms around someone and in public too! Nevertheless, the dance hall is (by the way) immensely popular. People who dance ballroom dance in Japan are a bit of a nudist in the West ... many more would like to, but would be inhibited by the culture. An adorable family movie that every hobby dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone. I understand that it was more popular in Japan than the Titanic. I think the Japanese are just like us all - they also like to be hugged.
