"Stanley and Iris" is a heartwarming film about two people who find each other and help each other to overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult because he has never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower and has two teenagers working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley reading in her spare time at home. Over time, they get involved romantically. After learning to read, Stanley goes to a good job in Chicago just to return to Iris and ask her to marry him, which is rare in today's films. An all-round good movie. <br /> <br />
