A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of Romanticism. If something is negative about A Chinese Ghost Story, it could be that the special effects were outdated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector must be in a remote area to collect a debt. Of course it is also tracked. <br /> <br /> What I did not expect when I saw this movie for the first time is that it's one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen; In other words, without losing the slapstick comedy that will put you in threads. Unlike some movies in Asian cinema, A Chinese Ghost Story is not hard to swallow for those who are unfamiliar with Chinese culture. In fact, it plays with timeless, uncultured themes of paranormality and romance. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2 if they had a wonderful love story in the mix. This movie is real, though it was overlooked by many. It is absolutely among the best I have ever seen. The ability to combine the best aspects of different genres and transcend cultural boundaries to appeal to humanity everywhere is fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
