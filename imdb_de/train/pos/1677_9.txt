La Coda Dello Scorpione (also the case of Scorpion's Tail) was the successor to director Sergio Martino after the wonderful Giallo Strano Vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the epitome of Giallo, which encompasses all aspects of the genre he has come to know and love. Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a bit of gore together make up a piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of Gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, can help make this one of the best non-Argento gialli. There is the already mentioned Martino, who adds a touch as a director, the great star Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicolai who creates the music, and a variety of Giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and the returning Anita Strindberg br /> <br /> Delivers Scorpione with all this talent behind it? You bet The movie works on many different levels. It's an exciting thriller, a thrilling and violent horror movie, and an exciting thriller. All in all one of the best Gialli. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to Gialli. In some parts of the film, he seems to almost channel Argento in his approach. In Bird With the Crystal Plumage, for example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in which the killer tries to break through the door, which actually surpasses Argentos film. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems with the movie? Hmmm ... only smaller ones. First, any scenes that do not follow the murders or the emerging romance between the two ladders begin to get boring. But just before you fall asleep, the killer jumps out of nowhere and you are immediately back on track. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the twists get a bit too bizarre. I mean, for what purpose did the scorpionsticks really serve? If you do not pay special attention to dialogue, you might easily get lost in the interweaving action. <br /> <br /> But aside from these trivialities, La Coda Dello Scorpione is tense, exciting, stylish and all-around fun for Giallo fans.
