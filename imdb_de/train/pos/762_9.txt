I enjoy watching breakdancing people, especially when they do, and in the best scenes of this movie, which takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even if I recorded it from TV when the State Movie showed Archive of Finland. In the summer of 2004, I went there on its own big screen to do it to look at me. It is much more comfortable on big screens than on TV. <br /> <br /> Even though many people think seeing this on a big screen is a waste of money on ticket costs I've paid for my ticket, I've earned the money because I've seen it because it's up large screens, especially in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just videos.
