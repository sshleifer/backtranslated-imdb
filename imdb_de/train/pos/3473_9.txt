I admit, I had some reservations when I first saw the previews for this movie. Was VH-1 here on hollow floors? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not look or sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit, this movie really surprised me. It's a long way from the movie I was expecting. Instead, it's a character study, an inconspicuous, bizarre, and ultimately bittersweet look at the friendship and ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to grasp what we once had and what passed us by.
