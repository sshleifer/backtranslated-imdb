It's a great movie. I claim that some people think that this may not be based on a true story. Anyway !!, the movie is great and all you can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid lands in the city of mermaids and so on. This means that all our peaceful dreams come true when we get up Trust us and do everything in this world to make it come true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I've seen in a long time. Good for her, for all actors, for the director. If someone can tell you that, please tell them: "A 25 year old guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie".
