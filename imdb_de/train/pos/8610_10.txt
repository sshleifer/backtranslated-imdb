Diane Keaton did an outstanding job in this rather sad but funny story involving many young people and their deep, dark secrets. Diane Keaton (Natalie), "The Family Stone," '05, who had a single daughter and loved her indescribably, can describe. She always called her and told her "Surrender Dorothy," an expression used in the 1939 Wizard of Oz. There is a sudden car accident, and Natalie is deeply involved in the friends and lovers of her daughter. The more Natalie investigates, the more truth she learns about herself and her relationship with her daughter. Great movie to watch and enjoy, especially the good drama of all supporting actors.
