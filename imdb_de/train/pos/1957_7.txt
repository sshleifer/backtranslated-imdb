Yes, I say, before I start commenting, this movie is incredibly undervalued. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is just as big in her role as Catherine Trammell, as is Morrissey as Dr-Glas. He is an analyst who questioned her about the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game, with which Trammel manipulates his mind. <br /> <br /> The drama was good (aside from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. She is smooth, bold and seductive and does not look a day older than at first. She really impressed me (like in the casino). Morrisey was good too. He showed a lot of responsibility in a role that needed it. Thewlis, however, was lame. He ruined his character and was superior all the way. He was really shit. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not the first, but Stone is a shout. Just ignore Thewlis.
