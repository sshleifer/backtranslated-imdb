This creepy, little movie is not a horror movie in the traditional sense, but it delivers the goods. It seems that a vampire is relaxed in a small German town and frees his victims from blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical when he assumes that a crazy killer is not a vampire. The only one who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the friend and lab assistant to the Inspector of Drs. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who, although apparently an outstanding scientist, joins the vampire theory. Townspeople suspect that spinner Herman Gleib has played with his usual rage of Dwight Frye, who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains a good deal of humor, which helps reduce the intensity of the murders that are committed. A funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt who thinks funny that Herman has not turned into a bat, but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye form a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget movie features elements from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Dr. Niemann uses the power of the proposal to execute a somnambulist arranging "Frankenstein" by using the human blood to create life in the lab, and "Dracula" as the killings of all except the inspector and his girl Work of a bloodsucker. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer and provided with a small comedy. The preparation works. The restored version I looked at used tints to enhance the ghostly atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
