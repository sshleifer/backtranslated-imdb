Will Smith once again delivers in a film about a man of the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to correct his wrongs in such a way that even the hardest hearts are touched !!! The writer Grant Nieporte and the Italian director Gabriele Muccino have created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to buy and keep in your movie collection, as you will never be tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the utmost respect for Will Smith, for not only is he a brilliant actor, but you can also say that he has a sincere love for people and life, which undoubtedly makes him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas ) that he played in this movie. You'll see how he feels his pain and anger, the frustration of his love for Emily played by Rosario Dawson, who incidentally was Fantastic as usual. I fell in love with the fact that her characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson plays a major role in this Top Notch movie as well. I find it very difficult to write this review without revealing the most important plot points. All I can say is, and if you make sure you have nothing to interrupt, pick the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to try the mysterious life and past of IRS Enlighten Envoy Ben Thomas ... Thank you, Will Smith, for another great movie !!!
