There is a story (possibly apocryphal) of an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the launch of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam produced (allegedly) a long list (think of the Fifth Element plane) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was called "things that Bruce Willis does when he acts". It ended with a simple message saying, "Please do not do any of the above things in my movie." <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam was not involved in the writing. <br /> <br /> I would argue that these two factors have played a major role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success, The Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> The Twelve Monkeys are all we can rightfully expect from a Gilliam movie. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but great) strangeness. Gilliam is pleased when he disguises his audience. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrowed in the clockwork of Kafka, a bureaucratic, relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey and the character developments that they undergo that are unsettling. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam films (especially Brazil). But all tend to suffer the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films are almost always confused (especially in Brazil). I still say that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there is no doubt that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the taut department. Style, substance, and form seem to merge in ways that are not normally known in Ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth about the rumor mentioned above, Gilliam also manages to achieve a first-class (and very untypical) performance from the bald. Bruce is excellent in this movie, just like the cast, especially a matching guy - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since the movie was released. When I saw it again, I realized that it had not really aged. Of course I had changed. And so I looked at the film with new eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a movie that is at least partially about reflections, changing perspectives, and the absurd one-way journey through the time we all make. A first-class movie. 8.10.
