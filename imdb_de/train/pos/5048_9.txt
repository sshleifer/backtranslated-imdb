This is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The storyline revolves around a confused man living in Texas, USA, who suddenly assassinated with his two young sons after being ordered by God to redeem the evil human world. Bill Paxton directing This movie plays the confused father known as the Hand of God Killer, while Matthew McConaughey performs his best performance so far as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides that he can no longer bear the burden of his murderous childhood alone, and uses flashbacks to tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can not think of many films that literally keep viewers chained to their place from start to finish, and this is definitely one of them. Even if you stop looking at it, you can not do it because of the sheer power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this film very well and help to determine the action through the good scenery. The acting in this film is great, but if there are any disadvantages, it is that some parts are very powerful and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very dark, the little children help to represent the idea through brilliant acting. This really is an exciting movie and it is guaranteed that you are consistently at the edge of your seat. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror, disturbing and powerful movies, or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
