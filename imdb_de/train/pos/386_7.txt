The visual art of Tsui Hark can be seen in this film. Unfortunately, the terrible spectacle of Ekin Cheng and especially of Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her watching, that's so bad :) that sometimes it was difficult to look at her. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I saw this for the first time, my chin kept falling down and I thought I had never seen anything like it before. However, this should be the case to fully live up to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung fu novels! Undoubtedly, this is one of the best-looking historical Chinese kung fu epic ever made. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather youthful (his apparent obsession with the stupid and overly long depiction of the bad guys did not help either). To make matters worse, this film is very poorly staffed. They decided to use the "hot" popular Hong Kong idols as protagonists, but unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited to historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mysticism to embody such characters. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I wish Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark could one day band together to produce a film that has the visual art of Tsui with the maturity and narrative poetry of Zhang ...
