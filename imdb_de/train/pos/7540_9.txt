I really enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie just underlines it. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family, who moves up the social chain as a result of the success of her husband (Danny Glover). She moves into a white neighborhood where people approach her in a friendly, yet awkward way. The various events that occur during the film are for some laughs, but most of the other emotions. This movie is less a comedy than a drama. I give a strong 8/10. I highly recommend it on TV or rent it soon.
