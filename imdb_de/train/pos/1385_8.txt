I only saw it in the Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille one night after its first public projection in Paris. A very nice movie about three 15-year-old teenagers who are all at the same psychological level. Many of the scenes remind us of our youth and our first feelings about sexual relationships. One can imagine that the director wants to reduce the girls' first strong sensual feelings to lesbianism, but even in this case she does not corrupt the likelihood of the story. Sometimes you find the movie a bit slow, but it creates that intimate atmosphere. I finance the young talent, especially Floriane and Marie very convincing. There are many small details, but in this movie I also found out what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
