I recently had the opportunity to see a screening of this movie. I think it will be in cinemas around Canada on Mother's Day. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a funny movie that feels good - it's more of a feel and thought movie. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development - he lets you get into the heart, mind and pain of Hagar bit by bit. At first, her attitude and behavior make little sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I liked her at the end of the film - especially when she opens her heart to the young man in the hut by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagel's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflects that Many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure, brings the viewer to the edge of his place - and a kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see Ellen's side in this movie. She is so different from the young woman she plays in Juno. It gives me an even wider appreciation for her acting skills. If you loved her in Juno, you will love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There's probably no way to express the power of action so much as the actor's ability to make you forget any other character you've ever played. I've never thought of Ellen Burnstyn in this movie - I've always and only thought of Hagar. She took me into her character - hook, line and sinker. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to capture this famous book by one of Canada's most beloved authors is impressive. She brings brilliantly both the stony and the angelic part of this complex woman, Hagar - the stone angel.
