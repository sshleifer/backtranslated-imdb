Me and 2 sisters looked at all 3 series from Tenko and agreed that this is by far one of the better BBC series. The entire cast was very convincing in the episodes they portrayed, and although the third series was a bit slower, watching and my evenings were used to it without it. No doubt we will look at it again, because it is a series that I would never see enough. Outstanding reputation and full score for the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone, although some age limits due to adult material must be considered. So grateful to the BBC for publishing this series on DVD and video.
