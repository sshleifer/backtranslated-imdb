I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's films and they are all beautiful and fascinating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie really impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet, caring friendship. They made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also excellent and the music captures the feelings in the movie perfectly. But the characters are the highlight in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now I want to clarify: I really speak of the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is (mostly) good, it just fades in comparison to the original language. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. I suggest watching the movie (and hearing it) as it was originally.
