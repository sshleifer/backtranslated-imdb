Everything I remember was excellent ... great cast with Sam Waterston & George Innes (before he became known to the US audience) ... excellent scripts that only the English can - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert campaign mysteries, but with a twist by Jules Verne. Much like MacGyver, it would have been 80 years earlier in England ... right at the beginning of the scientific and technological revolution of the 20th century. I've often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver was aired only 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a badly deteriorated band.
