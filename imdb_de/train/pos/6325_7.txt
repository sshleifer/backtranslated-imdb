This film is not only entertaining, with outstanding comedy, but also politically interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but makes fun of the Soviet mentality through and through. The story takes place at the beginning of the Soviet Union and questions the reasons for the revolution both culturally and practically. Of course, in the late '80s and early' 90s, the bizarre strictures of Soviet society were already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and ready for a well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this profound philosophical commentary is packed in a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
