Jessica Albas Max and Valerie Rae Miller's original Cindy shine in this action-packed and atmospheric series. Wonderfully politically wrong. The quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but in general the standard is high and if not Jessica is always worth a look. Valerie's urban jivetalking African American occasionally pulls Dark Angel almost into the sitcom territory.
