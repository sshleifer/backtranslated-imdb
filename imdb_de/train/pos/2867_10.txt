I lost my father at a very young age. So young that I do not remember him. Over the years, I've learned a lot about him. One of these things was that he loved Western, and it was an absolute ritual for him to see Bonanza every Sunday night. I myself remember the end of the series when I was eight when the show was set in 1973. If I look at this show over the years, I come closer to my old, long-lost father. It has all the right elements to make a show successful: laughter, tears, edge tension and sometimes even angry. My vivid memory of the original running of the show came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. In a certain episode and at the end of the credits, a picture of Blocker flashed and turned black. I remember my eldest sister with a tear in my eye. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. In the name of my late father, who is not here to tell himself, we love Bonanza. The Cartwrights live long.
