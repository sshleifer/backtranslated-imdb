Part of the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the storyline, in order to make the film more marketable for a public audience from the 50s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with maliciously witty characterizations of the bourgeois bureaucrats who run the Foreign Office. After that, the film loses itself in a conventional farce plot. Terry-Thomas is as always to be seen, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers and others) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A distracting but not a great movie.
