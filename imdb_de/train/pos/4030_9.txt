This movie was absolutely wonderful. The time and culture before the division has been beautifully recreated. Urmila has shown another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this film is that it does not draw on Pakistan beatings, which are widely used in films like Gadar and LOC. Against the background of the partition, the film does not focus on political issues or focuses on violence or what is right and wrong. At the center of the film is always the tragic story of Urmila. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai was excellently portrayed. The film actually shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, are suffering from this separation. The theme that there is only one religion is really prevalent in this film.
