Twenty-five years ago, I showed this movie in some entomology classes and still remember the excitement of the kids. They were banned! It's not just about the termites who built and live in the "castles of clay," but also the other animals that use the hills. There's a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony watches over Mungo's guards. It is not only good for entomology courses, but also for ecology lessons, because there is so much about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the overall ecology of all the organisms that live in and around the hills. <br /> <br /> I wish it was available on DVD so I could watch it again and show it to others.
