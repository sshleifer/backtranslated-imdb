I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin of these women, would encourage Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. You can certainly be considered as the "skeletons" in the family room. Additional features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who attribute some of their ideas to these curious women. I would say that anyone who is interested in fashion fascinates the discussion of these designers. (ie "Are you crazy, or am I missing something?"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not have it. Facets however.
