I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that there is an insight into the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is rarely addressed in films, most of which report on the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performances of the actors. I thought they gave very honest and convincing depictions of a very run-down underworld that not many people hear from outside my home-coast. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun Ganster movie with great performances by a who's who in Northern Irish actors. It does not move the earth, though it may open the eyes of some people to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries.
