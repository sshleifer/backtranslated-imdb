The premise of this anime series revolves around bread, from all things an action is based on! I really laughed. The main character has a special bread making power with which he was born, and he goes to the bread baking school. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter if it has subtitles or is dubbed - it's so good. Even the title song alone is funny. At one point of the theme song, there is an African-Japanese man with afro on horseback who wears a French baguette like a samurai sword. These pictures only make sense if you see the anime. You will laugh until your sides hurt. It's definitely the most unique anime I've ever seen.
