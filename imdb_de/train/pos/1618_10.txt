This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never gets down to any character, not even the hapless Johnny. It also benefits from focus, production design, casting and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and that "Cher" is more unlike anything she has ever done is a miracle to me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and have looked at it again on this Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin daughters and they were also thrilled. It has something for everyone with heart and leaves you in the end to be filled with joy.
