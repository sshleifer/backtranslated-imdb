This is a pretty little crime drama that fits in well with its 65-minute runtime. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rookie buddy Tobin (John Miles), a shady killer on the run and even an interest in the Tobin in the form of a female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) helping with the investigation of the crime. There is also a grand finale being staged at a stone-carving yard. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, look for a great joke in which Lt. Corrigan calls the dead woman "Tatooed Tilly" before the coroner reveals that she tattooed herself (confusing, right?). Even though Tobin is chasing the killer over the backyards, he is suddenly pointed in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did not catch him!
