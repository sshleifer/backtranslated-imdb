... but I liked that show anyway. I've read some of the comments reviewers made earlier on this show, and it's hard for me to completely annul all criticism in my mind (except one that stale the show, but this program was stale). Many things that people deal with about this show are down to the money: presumption; forced; overwrought; desperate for attention; complacent; annoying omnipresent story. But, you know what? I really want it. It was different, it was original, it was really, very much GOOD. and that made up for all the disadvantages. The show was bright, verbal, fast, funny, interesting and interesting to watch. You know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. I will mourn for his death. But I think nobody will bring this back to life.
