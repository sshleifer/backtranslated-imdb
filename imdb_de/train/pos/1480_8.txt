I'm watching TV and watching Casomai. It changes, it evolves or is better ... it goes on. It begins with a wedding of the two protagonists, where their love story is reported. After everything changed, one child was born, and the rest usually happens in a couple. It is not a special movie because it speaks of a normal couple and normality is the center of this movie. It does not want to show us anything special, it's nothing new, it's just a normal love story, the story of a couple, and since it's normal, it's different from the rest. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene only takes a few seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions generate history and destroy it. It's a simple story of a couple, as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a couple, it should all be known, but it's for sure that each one of you wants to know what's going on, so do it Do not forget to see the end!
