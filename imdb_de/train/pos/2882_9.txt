Cinderella was one of the first movies I've ever seen, and for me it's timeless. It's a beautiful looking movie with a beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene was the apparel scene - I just love these mice. The songs are also lovely, not as good as Snow White, but they are a joy to sing and remind of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish and so that is love? are outstanding. The characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice gave a great comic relief. The stepsisters were as well done as Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really evil compared to a great character in the name of the goddess of the fairy godmother. It's true, the movie easily gets on with the antics of the mice, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overrated, underrated, do not you think? It seldom plays on TV, but the really bad sequel to Cinemagic regularly. If you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try the wonderful Ever After or the lavish slipper and the rose, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the continuation that I have in the possession of the mistake because you will thank me. 10.9. Bethany Cox
