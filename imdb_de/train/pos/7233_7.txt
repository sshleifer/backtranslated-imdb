I did not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version may have been cut. I'm curious about that myself, because the later parts of the movie just did not make sense to me, even if I re-watched them. 30 minutes seems to be really short for a movie in 1917. "Poor Little Rich Girl," which was Tourneur's next film, is 65 minutes long, and "Pride of the Clan," which was his previous film, was 84 minutes long. I am relieved that I am not crazy, there is a part of this film missing, and therefore the resolution did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to review a review or commentary on a movie that you can only see in half, but I would still recommend this movie because it gives us a really intriguing view of the interior of a movie studio back then on the east coast offers. It's the earliest movie I've personally seen and based on the movie industry itself. The main character is a movie star, played by Robert Warwick, who later became a Hollywood lead actor and appeared in almost all the films of Preston Sturges. He plays a western actor, perhaps a bit like William S. Hart, who resembles Warwick a bit. After the really intriguing sequences in the studio, we see her filming in a shoot that discovers a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that's going very badly. After this point, the film seems to have important pieces in the form that we have now. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it again to anyone who is interested in film history for the documentary value, but in the form that we have I do not consider it a movie and is not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
