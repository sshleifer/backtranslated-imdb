This is a seething British comedy movie that I was able to watch time and again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role, and this is no exception, especially with his dry joke, but a very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he played in "Streets of San Francisco". I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie. She seems to be so unable to do anything she tries to do, but in truth she is so involved, especially in the end, when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money in washing her clothes. One thing concerns me, however. Could someone please tell me why I can not buy this DVD in either DVD or VHS format in the UK? Could someone help please?
