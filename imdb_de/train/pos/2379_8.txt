The H.G. Wells Classic had several incarnations. The 05 'Speilburg version and the classic 53' version But only this one remains completely true to the book. Nothing is changed, nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. The director cuts the film back to two hours of first-class quality. It has a chapter by chapter visualization of the novel pages that "Wells would be proud of" The story is how everyone remembers. Martians conquer the earth with capsules containing an army of Tripod war machines. The Earth people of the nineteenth century are ill-prepared to fend off alien forces and defend themselves with cannons and cannons shot down directly by the Walkers. If humanity is no longer a world power, they will be saved by the world's smallest organisms. <br /> <br /> The film is an outstanding achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has great potential as he skims this vision with a meager 5 Million budget realized. Today, B movies have bigger budgets.
