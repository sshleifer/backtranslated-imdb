This is a movie that was done very well. I had heard mixed reviews when it was in production and I was waiting for the release! Cheers to the director and all the actors. The understudy gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here says, the last part of the movie is fascinating. Katie Cassidy did a great job with her character as she had not worked much when this movie was made. She has quite a career ahead of her. I was amazed at her performance. I totally enjoyed the movie, challenged my life values ​​and priorities, and am a better person for it! A great message lies in the movie. Let it go, so that everyone can enjoy it!
