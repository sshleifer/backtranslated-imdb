Wonderful movie, one of the best horror films of the 70s. It is realistic attitudes and atmospheres. As usual, the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have found that most horror movies of a certain period often are not even enough. Of course, because most horror movies are old and must be Denigrati, this is like a mental mechanism that moves the consciousness of music critics here. Before you read, the review already knew what the final verdict was. In the movie a good gift, because 10 is really well done. Raines reads pretty well and the movie as a way of producing it reminds me of many Kubrick movies. He really has an impression. Really an excellent movie. I look at a filthanology of the years '70.
