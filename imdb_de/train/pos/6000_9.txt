Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) broke up and misses her lover. she can not overcome her love for him, lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives him a list of her mistakes with things she needs to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the healing of pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impresses in "The Cure" is the stylish camera that alternates black and white with color. The short and sharp script is able to develop a tragic and gritty love story with an unexpected plot point in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit loud and related to the fact that English is not my native language. In a few moments I had to repeat a few words that the narrator whispered. The unknown lead actress has a great performance and is extremely great. I hope I can see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
