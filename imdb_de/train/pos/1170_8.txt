Night Of The Living Homeless is a fun parody of the 1978 movie (and remake of 2004) of "Dawn Of The Dead." Only this time ... with the homeless I can not figure out why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want to change, and a few parents end up like in the movie on the roof of a supermarket. Now it's up to the boys to figure out where they come from and how they get rid of them. This is a pretty funny episode with some good moments like the guys singing their own version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love". Overall, a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
