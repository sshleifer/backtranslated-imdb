I agree with "Jerry". It's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many good low budget movies are NOT underestimated?) If I recall correctly, the solution to the puzzle was a kind of variation (but not "rip off") from 2001. Because the computer, who controlled the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to separate his "mind," but not the mechanical parts of it, and as with HAL, this led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. If the Christopher Cary figure, who finds no food, finds the abandoned beast, there is a kind of ominous moment, but then obviously that does not happen.
