This game is very addictive, I played it for hours until late at night, but even the fact that you can not save a game when you're in space has helped, sometimes I just had to keep playing to avoid it play delete all game data. <br /> <br /> Well, "Freelancer" is addictive, but also pretty flawed. Something that bothered me a lot, for example, was that you could not skip any of the cut scenes, which sometimes caused you to see the same few cut-cut scenes again and again. A great opportunity for me to do multitasking, check my emails or chat with my friends, and even more similar things, while I had to wait until the cut scene is over promising, but the farther you come, the more ridiculous it gets. The game also ends pretty abruptly, at least for me. It is obvious that they point to an imminent continuation. I do not know if a sequel is in progress, but I'm sure I'll probably pick one up as soon as it's released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very simple! Also for those who do not know flying games. To put it boldly, any fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are pretty tough and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which may be too short. But thank God for the multiplayer option! It allows you to play short missions, just like the single-player game when you complete it by the way. <br /> <br /> Even though many missions are alike, it remains cool to be in the midst of the occasional massive aerial bouts. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game, but beware of his mistakes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
