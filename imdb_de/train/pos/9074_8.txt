The show is really funny. Nice topic. Jokes and insoles are really good. With a few extra settings, it can become a very popular show. The only big drawback of this show, however, is the cast. David Spade does an excellent job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell did it, are Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are the show's main characters, making viewers watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man. The relationship is awakened ... with an experience of all the problems a couple is facing in a relationship. Patrick Warburton - doing a terrible job as Jeff, he is not suited for the role at all. He is like a robot, literally there is no punch in his dialogue delivery. <br /> <br /> Cast is really important to viewers. The bad acting will certainly bring the show down ...
