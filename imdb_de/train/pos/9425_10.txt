A super-comedy series from the 1990s (two series were produced in total), which has suffered due to bad scheduling in the British ratings. If you're dealing with established comedies like Minder, even the best new comedies will struggle to stand out. Luckily, I got the series from the first episode and eagerly followed her. I mentioned it back then to friends and family members, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot them. <br /> <br /> Then I checked the internet and found that an Ultra-Fan tried. Both series are released "on my own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
