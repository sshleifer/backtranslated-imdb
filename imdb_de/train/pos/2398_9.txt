I really enjoyed this movie. It took a rather dark story - that of Shakespeare's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a quirky, often witty and poignant modern yarn. <br /> <br /> A kudos for the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of New York and Macbeth together under one roof. The opposing worlds are really <br /> <br /> acting on the intrigue and comedy of the game and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a chorus, a part that does not exist in the piece but really adds to jazz things above. The end is noticeable among the small indies that I have seen for its closure and originality.
