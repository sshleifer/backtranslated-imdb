Something about "Paulie" touched my heart like no other movie. It's a fun, funny and yet emotional movie. I am a late arrival to become a fan of this movie. I only saw "Paulie" in May 2004 and ordered the widescreen DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects that Paulie shows in conversation are outstanding. My son asked me how the bird knew so many sentences. Probably my favorite part of the film is when Paulie is in the Gena Rowlands Company (Ivy) Company, followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a very good role as a kind-hearted person. You got him all the way through the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong and rent or buy this movie !!
