My daughter is really angry with me when I tell Drew Barrymore as if she's been hit in the face with a pan, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin, for which Jay Leno would die. How wonderful when I discovered in Fever Pitch that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best described as a cute, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will love the movie because of its romantic charm and the vulnerability of Jimmy Fallon, and the boys will like it because of the male attachment and portrayal of sports madness. My sports hatred wife, my teenage daughter and I all found something that should please the movie. That says something. It is a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half and is probably also a really good date-flic.
