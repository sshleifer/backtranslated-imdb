I think they've been telling the truth the whole time ... I can not trust the wilderness ... Their family went through hell. These poor boys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But still dealing with the rumors. As well as the loss of her little sister. I can not believe that this case lasted so long. Apparently, the jury could not tell the truth, even if they bit their ass. I have no idea what they went through, I can not imagine it. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to look after my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should see that.
