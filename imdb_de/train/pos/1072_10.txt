I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The storyline needed a few tweaks, especially in the first season. Season 2, however, was more of a freak show and lost the original charm of DA. The first season of the first season was more interesting, an easy side in life at Jam Pony, while a focused, serious plan with Manticore chased the X-Series. I was looking forward to new seasons, I still am. I hope that the FOX guys and the DA production teams realize that many people are still waiting for DA to make a comeback. Even after two years of demolition, DA can get big if edited properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should rise to that challenge.
