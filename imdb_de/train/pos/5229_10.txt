This movie has received terrible reviews from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres, my car and Stupid and Dumber, this movie is for you. If you are interested in movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, you have to move in a different direction. Nevertheless, I love this movie and everything, even if it is somehow "kiddy". This is one of the few films that I and my friends could watch over and over again over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT MOVIE. This movie should be AFI's # 1 because it's so damn high class. The only problem with this movie is that you have trouble seeing it because it was made for a TV movie on a channel that no longer exists. I do not know how to get this movie, I would like to buy it for DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still recorded it from the beginning. You can come over if you want, and look at it, but I could sleep. This movie rocks and that's basically all you need to know.
