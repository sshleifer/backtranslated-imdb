The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such unpleasant and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, watch this movie because it's full of preggo kills and failed abortions. Brooke Adams plays as Virginia. She and her husband go to a fancy fertilization clinic because they can not have children. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling had a very high pregnancy success rate of couples. (Put in a joke here.) Is it because he creates super mutant babies with a genetic killer? That's what Virginia starts to think about as she has some unusual side effects and extreme moods from the treatment. Then she starts to take matters into her own hands. <br /> <br /> With this part, you'll need to move the rest of the details elsewhere, because if I tell you all the good stuff this one had, you might get hurt. You're putting it into your Netflix rental queue too fast. It's a bit slow for a while, but once it's in the last third, all systems are up and running! Highly recommended by me because of the strengths of his un-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of 17 stars.
