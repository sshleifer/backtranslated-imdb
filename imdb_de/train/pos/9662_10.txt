As a longtime fan of Bette Midler, I have to say that her live concerts are my favorites. Bette delights us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. Bette is a real rainbow of emotions and talent, showing off her solid repertoire and new songs from the "Bette of Roses" album. For generations it offers something for everyone. The only divine diva proves that she is the most talented performer.
