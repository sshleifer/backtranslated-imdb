This work is a bold look at the mindset of men in wheelchairs. This movie never tries to reassure him, cotton candy or soft soap, the fear, confusion and pain of what these guys are living on. I think that's his strength. <br /> <br /> But the performances are fantastic, with well thought out and delivered dialogues that will attract you and make you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to stop the audience from knowing what they have in mind - what is in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it uncomfortable, but it's fun. 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
