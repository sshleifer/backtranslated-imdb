At first I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie when it appeared in my guide, so I looked in IMDb and found the cover pretty cool. I thought I would try to expect a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> When I overcame the fact that I disliked Busy Phillip's superbly played Alicia character, I realized how well this film manages to establish the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna that was played by Erika Christensen during most of the movie, but we find that although they are polar opposites, they all have one thing in common except that they are in the shoot. They share the loneliness and to what extent reveals the progress of the film. <br /> <br /> I just have to say how much I loved this movie and I was glad to see all the positive comments on it. I could not even get through Elephant because it seemed to exploit the Columbine tragedy. This film was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips drama is OUT OF CHAIN ​​!!! That's a good thing, and I would be very happy if she developed into more mature roles.
