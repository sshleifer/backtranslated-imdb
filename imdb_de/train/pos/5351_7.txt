Although this movie is somewhat filled with cheese from the eighties, I have a place in my DVD rack, and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is, "Television is rubbish, so turn it off and make a living." For those of you who have decided to pay attention to the message, you should read the book, it's not like the movie at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story, a mortally wounded Richards crashes a plane into the network building, killing himself and everyone else, and at the same time closing the network. I read it many years ago, but today it would be hard not to compare it to 9/11.
