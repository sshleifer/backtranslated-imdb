Nowadays it is rare to find a romantic comedy that is not unbelievably disgusting throughout the movie in short doses (eg Big Fat Greek Wedding, Me, Myself & Irene). There were just a few unnecessary crazy jokes in this movie, nothing unpleasantly profane. All around it was a sweet movie with sympathetic characters. I found the ending a bit abrupt. It feels like they should have finished it at the World Series for a real finish. The acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. If I had known it was a Farrelly Brothers movie, I would have thought it was a gnawing garbage piece and did not see it, but it seems that even they accidentally make a good movie. Good for you, I hope you pull out the rest of the way and make good movies all the time.
