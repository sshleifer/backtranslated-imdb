I am amazed that we see only one Negro criticizing this old movie. Usually we do not get good opera films, and here's a real big opera performance. Understandably, the visuals are not great. It is outdated. But as an opera you can not fault it; and I'm an opera buff. I can not even recognize a lip sync. If we did not know that Tebaldi was in tune, nothing would convince me that it is not Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING with flair! Her dark makeup is good; and she brought the role to a beautiful life! The rest of the cast is wonderful, as is this stunning ballet troupe. Most actors are excellent. Loren really wonderful. Her rival Amneris is also great. Those who were not interested in this 1953 job are ashamed. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
