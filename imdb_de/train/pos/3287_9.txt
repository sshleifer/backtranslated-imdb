My friend and I selected "Paperhouse" from a random stack of movies on our weekly excursion into the horror section - none of us had heard of it, but the rattling on the box was really promising. And the movie did not disappoint me, though I still probably would not call it an exclusive horror movie. Eleven-year-old Anna Madden moves into a house and visits it in her dreams. She definitely sleeps when she sees the house, but it's so real that it's almost like a completely different reality. Which, in the face of later events, does not seem far from the truth. Anyway, she can complement the house, the content and the environment by simply adding it to the picture. <br /> <br /> As this happens, Anna becomes increasingly ill with fever, and besides, she is completely obsessed with the house and her drawing. Besides, she and her mother are dealing with her absent father; He has a job that takes him away for long stretches, even though one has the impression that there is more in the story than in the story. <br /> <br /> OK, so drawing sounds easy - but honestly, there's something really threatening about it. The dream world is incredibly surreal - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a desolate field. The people who made the film did a great job, which made us very uncomfortable with this alternative dream and the ongoing dream. <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about (I do not give that up, you know that) The moment he appears to be the same child). In fact, Mark can not go because of a disease; He can not walk in Anna's world of signs because she did not draw his legs. She blames herself for his real illness and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything starts to get weird. She even brings her absent father into the drawing with catastrophic consequences. The stuff with the dad is really scary. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything away, so I stop ... There seems to be a lot going on in this film. I'm sure you'll have a ball that analyzes this thing and kills your buddies after you've seen it. Is it a simple story, it seems, or is there really layers of meaning? I do not know, but it is fascinating. There was a "Nightmare On Elm Street" quality about crossing reality and dreams at some point. I love things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times, which was not the case. I'm happy with the end that it had (some of you sensitive guys would like to have Kleenex at hand!), Though there may well be different conclusions. In any case, it does not feel so dressed when it's actually over, but as you watch and relax, it's a bit nerve wracking. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, "Paperhouse" is really a good movie. It's well done and acting - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna - is top notch. Burke, who has never appeared in a movie before, is a real gem. I do not know why she never did anything else, but she's really convincing and enjoyable to look at. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / slightly different kind of movie, with certain cruel moments - but you can still look at it with your family and you have to Do not worry that your little brother or grandmother will be plagued by blood spraying or something. <br /> <br /> Give me a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should also read the book ...
