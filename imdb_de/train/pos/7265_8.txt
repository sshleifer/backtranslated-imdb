Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good actors. Good direction Good art direction. Good photography Good sound. Good editing Everything alright. Everything together and you get good conversation. <br /> <br /> The shame is that not nearly enough films of this caliber are being produced these days. We are fortunate that writers / directors like John Hughes are sometimes able to hear their creative voices. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I see a movie for the third or fourth time, I still find it satisfying. I have to realize that there is something right about this movie.
