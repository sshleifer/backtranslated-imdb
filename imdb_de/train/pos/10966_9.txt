Gray Gardens is a world of its own. Edith and Little Edie live in almost complete isolation and eat ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their (apparently) common bedroom. Cats loll, while Mother Edith offends her daughter's upbringing. This is a Tennessee Williams piece that was brought to life to inspire scriptwriters and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me of my grandmother and her 50's daughter lived for a decade (besides being poor and clean). They would argue all day long, the grandmother spoke about her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter blamed her for missed opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for anyone who writes a mother-daughter relationship of this nature. It is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers have done amazing work by making the Edies so comfortable, that they show themselves so ruthless. It's rare to see the real life in this way and the more special, considering the context - remnants of a powerful family that vanishes into nothing in the skeleton of their own mansion.
