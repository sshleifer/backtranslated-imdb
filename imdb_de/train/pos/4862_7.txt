This musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but somehow it manages to be mostly fun. The plot contains some elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, though he co-wrote the script. Although the songs are charming, they have nothing to do with this film and are unusually coarse in the plot, even pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen make their usual attempt quite competent, but the sound of the rest of the film lacks about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are a few highlights. Reginald Gardiner does a good job reminding that this is a talkie and stops being attacked like a dumb actor. And there are a few bits that could only be written by Wodehouse, though the film feels largely like the production of one of the Hollywood Meetings, which he later parodied.
