This movie blows you off your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces 8 fascinating people, building blocks of a captivating film mosaic. They survive one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great verve and skillfully interweaves their individual stories, a tour that commemorates the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes surprises, moves, amuses; The dialogues are so natural that they seem to be improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman," a bizarre guy who dances throughout the movie. Sam is also responsible for the breathtaking choreography, and of course Tom Barman took care of the ultra-cool sound track himself. We were very impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that blows you off its feet.
