I loved this movie. It's a definitive inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rent or worth buying. It should be in every home. Best movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you angry because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of funny lines to keep you up to date. I love many quotes. I use it all the time. They help me focus on what I want to do. It shows that everyone can realize their dreams, all he has to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I look at it, I never realize it's as long as it is. I am so deeply absorbed in them that it happens so fast. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.
