The previous reviewer said it exactly. Once I saw it, it was enchanted, saw it a second time, when it was re-aired within a week or two of the first broadcast. I still remember some scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is the First World War. One of the scenes was in a public area dedicated exclusively to women, which was an interesting historical comment. The moment when one of the women touches the other for the first time is one of my great movie moments. I do not think that's a "gay movie". It is an interesting and tender love story, in which the two main actresses are women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this if it ever came out on DVD.
