The symbolic use of objects, the editing of the form, the position of the characters in the scene ... all were so happily abandoned by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fruitful genius he had. The way the woman moves from one corner of the ring to another in the course of the fight, the processing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a little obvious by today's standards, in the quiet Time in which they spoke volumes about history, without a word being spoken. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that the lover buys, and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
