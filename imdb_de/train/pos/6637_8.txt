The story goes that on December 28, 1895, a small group of thirty-three people gathered in the Paris Salon Du Grand Café to witness the Cinématographe, a supposedly new invention that came out of the work of some photographers named August and Louis Lumière , The small audience that reunited on that day (some by invitation, mostly out of curiosity) did not really know what to expect from the show, and when a stationary photo appeared projected onto a screen, most thought that was cinematograph just another fancy project current slide projection projections. Until the photo began to move. What these thirty-three people marveled at that cold December was the very first public display of a moving picture projected onto a screen; History was written and cinema as we know it was born that day. <br /> <br /> Of the 10 short films that were shown on this historic day, "La Sortie Des Usines Lumière" (literally: "leaving the Lumière factory") ") was the very first one screened Film shows the many workers at the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory and leave the building at the end of a hard day's work, although the film was a very simple "actuality film" (film that is a real event), but he Surprised all viewers, as his concept of moving images was limited to Edison's "Peep Show" machines (the kinetoscope), the brothers' invention. It was like nothing they had seen before, and the audience stood in awe as The idea was not completely new (Le Prince shot the first movie back in 1888), but the way the film was shown was simply revolutionary. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" would be the first in the la a series of "actuality films" that the Lumière would produce over the years. This primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the applications the cinematograph could have. Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm, the Cinématographe was a great success after the first screening and "La Sortie Des Usines Lumière" quickly became an iconic image of this first show. It was definitely not the first movie the brothers made this year, and it was probably not the best of the 10 films that were shown that day (personally, I think "L 'Arroseur Arrosé" is the best of the 10 was); However, it is really significant that the very first film was the opening of a gate pair, as this movie literally opened the doors to the cinema as we know it. 8.10
