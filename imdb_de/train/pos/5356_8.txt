Running Man is not a great movie, in fact it's kind of stupid. But it delivers what you want in an Arnie movie, and that's action and entertainment. I do not see that someone can not enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and over the top that it's almost funny. By the way, this is probably one of the best citable Arnie films out there.
