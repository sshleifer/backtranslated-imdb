Skippy by Family Ties goes from pure cut to metal kid in this pretty cheesy movie. The film seems to have been written in response to those angry parents who claimed that metal music would make their children angry or make them kill themselves - unless a dead satanic metal star tries to get out of the grave ( to help out with Skippy)). And while the plot is crazy and clich√©d, the craziness (for example, a nasty green mist that takes off a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack make the movie so funny (and awesome). And of course, there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have some friends for a good laugh. And while you're at it, make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's a "nasty rocker" (as stated on the video box), a black leather driller killer with fringes. A must for cheesy movie fans.
