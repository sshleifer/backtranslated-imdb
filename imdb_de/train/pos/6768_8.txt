One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, it went downhill when they decided to include Jean Bruce Scott in the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and Ernest Borgnine's character. The last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, the blacks have not lasted long in television shows these days. Some of the episodes in Season Two were okay, but season three was more about the human characters than Airwolf, and it was not shown until the end of the show. When it went to the US, it was disgusting !!!
