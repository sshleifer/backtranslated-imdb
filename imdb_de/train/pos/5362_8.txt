THE RUNNING MAN is together with TOTAL RECALL my favorite film from Schwarzenegger. No, that's not 2001, but it's not supposed to be. And the acting and the script are not even comparable to other Arnie films like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I maintain that the IDEA behind this film is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete with "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (runners are not equipped with any), the lust of sport and the blood of the citizens to satisfy. The ultimate prize for a winner: freedom. For example, the rules claim. <br /> <br /> He really has a lot to say for a movie with such outstanding bloody death scenes and kitschy one-liners. Somebody else has pointed out all the comments on culture / government presented in this film, so I will not go into that here. Suffice to say, if you can look beyond the movie's seemingly stupid feeling, you'll enjoy it a lot (especially if you're a big SF fan with a lot of imagination). Like I said, it's not a serious art movie, but it's surprisingly multi-layered for an 80s shoot-em-up movie. The premise comes from a short novel by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but deviates quite strongly from his source material, especially towards the end. (The book ends rather nihilistically, it's needless to say that this movie is not true.) I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "I think it's because of steroids."
