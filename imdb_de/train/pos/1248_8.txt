"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his mega hit "Beverly Hills Cop". And though it's not as good as "Cop," it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy Stars as a finder of lost children who have been assigned an unusual case. His task: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This film could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Death," as parts of this movie are played like a Spielberg adventure, sort of like an Indiana Jones comedy. It's a comedy with laughter and adventure with special effects. Have fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
