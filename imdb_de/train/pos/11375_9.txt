This film tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From the meticulous descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the chief investigator, you will be amazed. It is an absolute must for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and agency collaboration are also great. Also not overly done. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in Russian history. How the police work with the political party, what it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been a while since I saw this movie for the first time. It does not reduce its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves you with the imagination, well, you'll see.
