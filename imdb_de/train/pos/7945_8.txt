I'm a fan of wildlife movies. If you can take action and use animals as the lead actor, you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just that. They took an act as old as time and gave it a new twist. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group (shadow), which is wise and logical, you have the endearing, but impetuous and unreliable chance, and the prudish princess, who believes that she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounce off very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters and they did not overburden them. Most people say it can not be good because it's too much for a children's movie. What they forget, though, is that it should be a children's movie, and this still does not take away the current movie. This is a good movie you can watch if you are bored and just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie with no cartoons, an aerial bud movie with a better storyline. I would without a doubt advise you to look at it.
