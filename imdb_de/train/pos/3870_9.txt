This is an extremely dense, dark and complicated movie that is slow-moving and reveals tormenting details, like the attention of a novel, and when you look at this film "IS" like a novel unfolding. I was not interested in the narrator because I thought he was out of whack with the rest of the performance. This film features some of the best ensemble acts I've ever seen, and the lead, Summer Phoenix, is fabulous. Their innocence and their naivety may find some implausible, a kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this review, but it's still fabulous, partly because it's different from anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier and part of what is so unique. This movie definitely does not show what you would expect. It's always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals more than necessary. With 163 minutes it is extremely close, to a mistake, I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It's filled with short moments that are just mind-blowing, some of the best you'll see all year, and all these moments make for an extraordinary movie experience. The family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has to say about the theater has not been seen in movies since Cassavete's "Opening Night" or perhaps Chaplin's "Limelight." But believe it or not, this movie is much less conventional. I never knew where this movie would go, and now that he has seen it, he still has many options. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative movie.
