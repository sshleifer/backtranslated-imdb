The choice of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist of Renny Harlin is commendable as Stallone is that kind of tough and rugged person who previously gave the Rocky Balbao and Rambo the boldly versatile aura. But comparing The Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched concept. <br /> <br /> The superbly designed opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, excitement and intrigue that transforms them into bloody and dangerous situations. Meeting the Outlaws The raid and high-altitude transfer of hard cash in suitcases Airplane to another is something that was not filmed before. <br /> <br /> The biting cold of the snow-capped Alps and the cheating and betrayal of the antagonist forces make one shiver with fear. The powers of great adventure and ruthless murder complete the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good movies are not filmed every year, and people do not always get a sense of humor that they can see every now and then. Apart from the filthy language / idiom, which causes a brisk excitement in certain scenes, the film can be regarded as one that does not lose its fascinating appeal even after so many years.
