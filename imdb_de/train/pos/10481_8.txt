A cute little movie that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to have been cut out of the same stuff in the last two years as half a dozen other British comedies. <br /> <br / > Widowed and thus broke, Grace is a gardener committed to helping her friend / colleague Matthew grow his potted plant. He did everything wrong and Grace helps him. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest the pot from which both can benefit. He enjoys smoking, she has to raise money to pay her mortgage. <br /> <br /> The highlight is Grace, who travels to London to sell some of her wares, dressed in a white suit that John Travolta wore in "Saturday Night Fever" and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always visible, and many people can not say that ... well, I can not do that anyway. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, whom I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or enlightening, but immensely entertaining, it feels like a walk with friends after 90 minutes. 8.10.
