Love the tv show. Was addicted for the first time when I saw it. I wish I was there with them. It touches the reality when you love someone and think that you want to spend the rest of your life with it, and then at a series of events where you meet someone else and that person is more of what you are with would like. You are in a situation where you need to select one or the other. Someone will be hurt, you can not stop that. The decision is hard to make but you want to be unhappy if you could have been. Why live on and lead a life that you thought you wanted or that you are doing right and that you both are unhappy? This other person will not wait, she has a good life. The decision you really want will ultimately be better. Making the most of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, houses, etc. will not make you happy if you have the person with whom you really want to be together to share it.
