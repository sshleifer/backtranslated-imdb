For a Slasher movie, this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre. Yes, it is predictable that the nut job kills on the run, the people die, Yada Yada Yada. But there are some good positives in this movie. I really liked the mask the nut job was wearing. It's definitely scary and maybe unique (even if I have not seen every single Slasher movie ever) and how it finally finds its end is, as far as I know, a novel concept. I also liked the weapon of choice used by Mr. sicko for most murders. The murders themselves are not as vivid as most of the genre, but that's a little worry. The movie is not serious. That's something most Slashers suffer from. If you look at the movie, I was reminded of the early Friday of the 13th movie that took itself There are a few concerns about this movie. In several scenes, the killer suddenly bears the resemblance to one of our horror icons. By that I mean his movements and reactions when shooting and also the way he walked. Of greater concern, however, is a scene very close to the end where Mr. Crazy carries more than striking resemblance (actually a complete rip-off) to another famous horror titan. In the last scenes we have our scumbag again, which looks exactly like the first horror icon that I mentioned. In fact, the final scene is almost completely rip-off from another icon in the Slasher genre. These scenes were weak and unoriginal. By the way, the movie is in Australia. So if you're a girl with an Australian accent (like me), you're in heaven. If you do not feel like it. Another great thing about this movie: beautiful Kylie Minogoue (do not get too attached to her), there's a non-Australian accent provided by Molly Ringwood as not. I enjoyed it and had a bit of fun , So I have to give "Cut" 8/10, which may seem too high to some people.
