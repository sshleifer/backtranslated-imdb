My comments on VIVAH: - It's a charming, idealistic love story with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to little pleasures, such as the families of the bride and groom sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly joke and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of engagement between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the creepy romantic moments between the married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games make you want idealism. The film ends predictably with the marriage, and the groom tells on the wedding night of his new bride, who suffers from burns: "Come, let me put on your bandage" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - shows many good things - beauty of the Arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of the Indian woman and last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the couple waiting to marry ... to play by the rules! Simple and yet beautiful; Such a simple story ... no plot ... no villain - as with most Sooraj Barjatya movies. Sooraj Sir is back to what he does best. He filmed the movie with FULL CONVICTION. It's a very sweet movie - teaching the current generation lots of good things about Arranged Marriage & Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good and she has done very well. She has the most good scenes - although I thought the last half hour was complete for Shahid Kapur - which gives a reverently restrained performance for a change. I also liked the acting of everyone else for ex. The Choti, d. H. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's brother-in-law. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as possible. Sooraj Sir got another nice family movie after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Things like sanctity in a marriage / relationship, avoid courtship, mutual respect, care & space, waiting for "official" marriages, praying / sacrificing for loved ones - all this and more are shown in Vivah. There is still a good audience that enjoys this movie. Some of the people / spectators are already excited after seeing that they are thinking about Arranged-Marriage :) Thats Success, if you ask me. AMRITA RAO - our actress from Vivah has received the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !! Hats off to this performance Chalo, even if Vivah, Shahid or Amrita have received no price and other awards; @ At least that's news for CHEER !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO for showing us a picture of the Indian Bride in the purest form and, of course, to Sooraj Barjatya to present her in the best way legendary as it is today !! Imagine, you share the same socket as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It is not an easy achievement !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - for raising her career to another level with this award ... Personally, I think she should only film with Shahid Kapur !! They are a sweet couple and their chemistry on the screen reminds me of {SRK-kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> Some points I've observed, some of the elements: - # 1 If you pay close attention, Amrita Rao looks so good because she always wears traditional clothes. She gives everything of the Indian essence - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not ready for a marriage or an early marriage ... but PREM listens attentively to the gradual conversation his DAD has given - full confidence in Anupam Kher. "Honesty" and "trust" are the key words he reflects in his first conversation with Amrita. Most people would think that such a first meeting with a complete stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But from what I've seen in this movie, I have the feeling - that two people made for one another can connect within a first meeting, it's possible !!! # 3 Throughout the movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences in which Shahid and Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Unlike most other romantic films where Hero & Heroine always sing, dance or do cheap stuff these days. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences: - Characteristic of restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I loved the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. These films should highlight the indifference shown in some parts of India for daughters / girls-children. # 5 Romantic scenes between the main couple are very nicely recorded - no cheap scenes, songs are beautifully depicted !! Words like "jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. are the buzz words for all the girls who liked this movie :) Personally, I really like the dialogues in this movie a lot. # 6 Last but not least - The entire hospital scene where Shahid Amrita presents "Sindhoor" when fighting for life - is terrific. These dialogues between the couple are so touching and you feel the LOVE / I can not-do-without-U; It's a hat-off feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness / chemistry on the screen of the LEAD couple:): ) *** IF U ASK ME: - Besides films like De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is one of the best movies of the year 2006. STATEMENT: I ​​think Vivah has earned something better as Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all these time passages / fuzzy / style / crap movies !!
