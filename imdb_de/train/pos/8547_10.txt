Many people hated this movie, but I blame myself with two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first American pie movies. and 2 - they try to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This was the best of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I say that, but what kind of teen comedy is not? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc., they are all incredibly predictable, but still goddamn funny! I say, it's worth it to see it, I love it, I find it funny. Do not look at it while comparing it to the first, because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and this one, it became obvious that all the American Pie movies were over and the Stiflers Which one of mine is FINE. <br /> <br /> Watch. Enjoy. Love. xD
