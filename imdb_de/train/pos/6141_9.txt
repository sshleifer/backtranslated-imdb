Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine, a middle-aged lady in war-torn England, during the First World War. She studied witchcraft by mail and learned it secretly at home, she is fine, until three children, who were separated from their parents by the last air raid, are sent to the huge house of Angela Lansbury. She is not happy about her because of her secret. They just want to go home. The oldest boy is very hard to get along with, he is a brat. The other two, a boy and a girl, are simply curious about their new whereabouts and the lady who is their hostess. The children learn their secret and then the fun begins. Fun and more of it. Family fun. Laughter, fun, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are pretty good. This is a musical that is as catchy to the tunes as it is to sing later like other Disney movies. Add this to your Family Video Library. You will not be disappointed.
