The movie was a long-awaited release that was somewhat disappointing due to the expectations I set. If I look at it again, I have to say that it is ok. First of all it is very original (of course not complete) and as such it is only meant to keep the right to the film. The story of Modesty as a child is shown and is very true to the original. Acting may not be the best, and the plot is a bit thin, but compared to the 1966 Vitti movie, it's much better just because it's not trying to be a musical. In general, I would only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or someone who sees it on TV.
