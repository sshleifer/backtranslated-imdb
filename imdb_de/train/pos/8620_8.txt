I have just seen the 139-minute (widescreen) version with some friends and we were thrilled. I will not worry about what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. After that, we were stunned to discover that nearly 30 minutes had passed, but that did not stop us from being completely involved and entertaining music / songs. Blues, country / folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used, we all burst into laughter. It's abominable You've been warned, but history and storytelling keep you on the ground. <br /> <br /> There are some outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many applications of silence and slow motion photography that work well. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Find this out. It's fun, different and takes you to places you would not expect, and that's very refreshing.
