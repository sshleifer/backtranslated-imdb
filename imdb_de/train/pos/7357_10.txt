OK, where do I start? ... this movie has changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill has done himself. After a first visit, I was disappointed that I had not seen it on the screen. However, this was many features before exploring the DVD !!!! Oh my God, Jake Cahill's commentary on the film was almost as flawless as his acting. He told of industry secrets that were used in the film that one experiences only with experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene of the guard talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite movies. I'm definitely with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without continuation. <br /> <br /> I'm still thrilled with any consideration of martial arts skills, which is only marked by the sign with the location of the library in the park school ... and maybe the guy who is playing a delay! All in all, a timeless classic and the best movie to come from Europe for years! where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
