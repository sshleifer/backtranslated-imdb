I like it because of my personal experiences. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the company did not really enjoy their "real" life, but they had a good time, d. H. What they were. The film has done a good job and made this simple day a good memory. A good memory not only includes romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely the deeper discussion about their liveability. Many movies are like that, in terms of defining the definitions of life or love or relationships, or the actual problems of life or some kind of it. Before Sunrise has dealt in a nice way with what makes the viewer think, adjust the breath and continue to watch the movie. Before Sunrise did not try to put a specific thought in your mind. It has just encouraged you to think about some of the issues of daily life and gave you alternative options. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical wailing complaints or flowing stupid ideas. They would still reflect on these topics and be curious about the next line of the story. The end was not important. They could get some of it and feel something good or positive about themselves after the movie. Films should be fun. This is an entertaining movie and it is worth to look at it. I am also on a journey. The film was somehow a part of me and answered some of my questions.
