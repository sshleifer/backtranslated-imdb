Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress other actresses could watch out for. She has the audacity to face (and accomplish) a very rare role for tough girls early in her career, which is a feat that should be recognized. Although her later films put her in the same role, this film was made for her robustness. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romanticized student / fighter / lover trying to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects. A bit over the top in the movie ... but not a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story goes deep when the heated relationships this girl is struggling with come to a standstill and take over her ire. <br /> <br /> I've seen an actress take such an aggressive attitude in filming, and I'm glad she gets that original twist in Hollywood. This movie received a 7 from me because of the average history of ghetto youth, but he has such a great actress who plays a rare role in a minimal budget movie. Good work.
