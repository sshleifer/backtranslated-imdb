I lived in Rawlins when this movie was made, and I was fortunate enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see what worked behind the scenes, from the barbed wire to the electric chair through the floor of the guards. It was also a lot of fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also, the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the film was and is called "Disney Gate" by locals. If anyone is interested and is ever interested in Rawlins, most movie sets are still there and can be seen during self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun working for and with R. Harlin and I wish I had a chance to do it again.
