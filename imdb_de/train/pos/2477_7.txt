As grand as it may be, Kenneth Branagh's monumental account of perhaps the most popular tragedy of William Shakespeare suffers from the burden of the four-hour season and certainly requires some perseverance. Two completely separate sessions would most likely be better enough to fully capture high-end filmmaking. Although I recognize this masterpiece as such, I must admit that there is no enthusiasm for the flamboyance of the ancient Bards, his rhetoric (and he is so good) and his many flourishes. "Hamlet" thus loses influence when it loses its hold. <br /> <br /> From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's movie to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets, the film is a feast of visual and aural delights, a fine addition to cast. Branagh has taken over three huge mantles that adapt, conduct and play. His adaptation is great, his sense strong, but when he came to Hamlet's role, the strain seemed to show; Nonetheless, he does a great job in an incredibly fiscal role. Derek Jacobi devours the gloomy Claudius for joy, and Julie Christie is as dramatic as his Queen Gertrude. Richard Briers as Polonius is wonderful, and Charlton Heston is again a strong influence on the screen as player King. Many others pass by, including Jack Lemmon (outstanding in a very minor role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. However, the acting award must go to one of the great discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. She is a moving portrayal of the most tragic character in this whole affair, Ophelia. <br /> <br /> To conclude (before this review takes longer than the movie), I have to say that it's the length that really reviews viewers in this movie. Branagh has directed a lot of sense and has given many important, influential scenes. Too many of them are still welcome. If you look at this movie, we will remember fantastically the many pearls of wisdom that we have gained from it. "Be neither a lender nor a borrower" or "Be faithful." And of course: "being or not being". <br /> <br /> The opening of the two hours requires some stamina, but if you manage to stay tuned, you're surely expected with a rousing finale that gathers momentum from the tragic funeral. <br /> <br /> Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
