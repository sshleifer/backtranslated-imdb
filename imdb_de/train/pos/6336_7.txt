OK, so the FX are not budgeted high. However, this story is based on actual events. Not a bit messed up to make some rich actors, even richer !! Like most books based movies, there are things that just do not fit. Only a few people have said that this movie is based on real events and not as a consequence, as most people believe it is !! This movie is in no way related to TWISTER! Unlike in both films are tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things you need to remember ... The actual "Night of the Twisters" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. Think about how far storm research has progressed at this time. It happened in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska, is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie calls the city something else, it says it's a small town.
