"Return of the Jedi" is often reminded of what did it wrong and not what did it right, and that's a shame because the final chronological episode of the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to summarize all the storylines of the previous films in a grand finale, and very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that are likely to broaden the demographics of Star Wars - and in the middle the movie slows down a bit. But the last hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, in which Luke finally meets face to face with Darth Vader, the most famous villain in film history. The return of the Jedi has done so many things right People tend to overlook this: it was an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which became somewhat implausible from the Empire Strikes Back games and very convincing here an exciting opening at Jabba Palace, a masterful performance by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor, Luke finally comes to his own, the dissolution of Solo and Leia's romance and the extremely powerful last moments on the Endor Moon. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are slight annoyances. But it's the annoyance of a generation of moviegoers who have had time to pick every single scene. It is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as the final chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's awesome!
