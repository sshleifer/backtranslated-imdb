Fritz Lang's German medieval history continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Revenge (1924). Kremhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband Siegfried. Her brother is too weak to bring the murdered Hagen to justice King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns should hagen Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a great battle of life and death begins, and she sets the whole place on fire. Hagen used to be dead, and Kriemhild too. These films cover great topics like revenge and immortal love. Of course, we later saw some better films from these topics. but this was one of the early ones.
