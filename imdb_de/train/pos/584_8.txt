An excellent film that deals with the life of an old man from his time. It begins around 1910 and remembers his boy and young adulthood. his family, friends, romance novels etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale .... "all things in life come together and a river flows through him and this river haunts me." Worth seeing.
