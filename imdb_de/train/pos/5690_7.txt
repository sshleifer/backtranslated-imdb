I watched this movie on DVD and thought the drama was very good, but the story left much to be desired. This movie has the same texture and look of panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that people can live this lifestyle; on the bottom of society, where their entire existence is based on hard drug use, crime, violence, sex and a complete lack of self-esteem for anyone or anything, including themselves, is outstanding in his role as the "burned out" former porn star John Holmes. The side occupation is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily life of these people was brutal. If you are not interested in these murders or have been a "fan" of John Holmes, this is not a movie you can see. If you want to see a documentary drama about murder, Truman Capote's 60s In Cold Blood with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
