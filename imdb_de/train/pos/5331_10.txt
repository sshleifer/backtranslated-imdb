Have just seen in Sky TV, missed the first half hour. I wondered if it was a true story, so I watched it to the end. In the end there was no instruction to say what happened to everyone. It reminded me of the speed, but at the end of the day I do not think it was released in the cinema because we saw the following mistake. The weak point we saw was that they take off the hood, and later there are two shots on the car, with the police car in front of it trying to slow it down when the hood is on again. It had me on my seat edge, especially when I thought the baby was going to hit the bridge, and of course, if the bridge would not be lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so it was not that bad !!!!
