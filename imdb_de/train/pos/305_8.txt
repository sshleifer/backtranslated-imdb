Screwball comedy about romantic disagreements in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is clearly in love with all the women in his picture - he adores her - but Audrey Hepburn is (of course) a notch above the others, after all, she is the princess Bogdanovich has probably fallen in love with in cinema 30 years earlier. He shoots her in loving close-ups, goes straight into the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled / soft-boiled Ben Gazzara, making her room sparkle everywhere. The love relationships that have been made in the course of the film are quick and amusing, though I tired of John Ritter's televised Kluzzer. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and down-to-earth, earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are exciting to look at. But it really is Hepburn's Valentine's Day and it absolutely glows. *** from ****
