Since the voting average was pretty low and the fact that the employee in the video library thought it was "just okay", I had no great expectations when letting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the above I really liked it. This is a charming movie. It did not have to grow with me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks offers a great performance as a main character, I think, something different than usual in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many knockout jokes or anything like that, but there are some pretty funny scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
