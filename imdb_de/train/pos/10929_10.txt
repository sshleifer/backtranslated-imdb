One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema (or almost everything that is fueled outside of this United States of America) is the permutations that crop up. For example, after the Second World War, Japanese manga (comics) are found in an infinite variety of themes, many of which are treated in a unique, imaginative way. The same thing happens with genre filmmaking; However, I refer back to movies created outside the U. (where we are just too "demanding" in our vicinity to appreciate anything that is not in the US or from us). For example, would an American company support not just one, but a set of films with a masked wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real martial artist (Bruce Lee)? As far as television is concerned, forget it. Although I still love the KUNG FU series that David Carradine played in, I always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts - as you might say - leaves a bit to be desired. To date, there has not been a pay-per-view channel for Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia. (There are a lot of softcore pornes being masked as entertainment shows, but the so-called Action Channel, for example, has to import or produce a true martial arts teleserie.) Before Brother Cadfile investigated murder in the BBC There was at least one kung-fu Film showing a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery: THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS. This martial arts masterpiece is as intriguing as any other genre-based Whodunit (Western, Police Show, etc.) and is a truly superior work. It is now available at Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and Bey Logan's DVD commentary is just the kind of smart, thoughtful analysis these gems really deserve. If you're a martial arts fanatic, rejoice: One of the greatest movie genres of all time (especially the martial arts films of the 1970s and early 1980s) is receiving a long overdue second life (and a second look highly appreciated). on DVD.
