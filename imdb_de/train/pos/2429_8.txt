If you loved Deep Cover, you might like this movie as well. Many of the poetic insets that Fishburne recites in Deep Cover come from the lyrical screenplay of Once In The Life, a screen adaptation of a play written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie that's all Larry, very hot and mature. Of course, there is gun game and prohibited substance use. This is a gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the chick wall. <br /> <br /> AMAZING movie ... dark, frightening, sexy and exciting. If you sneak out at night or hang out in a clubhouse, you'll be resisting the cramped sets (meteophorically caught in the echo). This movie is full of clever ideas and complex relationships. All feelings are reflected in the set dressing and in the camera shots. GOOD WORK!
