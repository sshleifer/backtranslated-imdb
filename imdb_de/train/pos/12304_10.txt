This is a great movie. I like it when Ning climbs his ink and the skeletons chase him, but fortunately he avoided them, opened the window and did not even notice her. Xiao Qian is also very pretty. and when he put the needle in Ma Wu's butt, it's hysterical. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords, he is also great. then the part where he eats his bread while watching the man kill many people. then you see him sing poems when he wanted to escape the wolves. The love scenes are romantic, Xiao Qian and Ning look cute together. add the comic timing, the giant tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy at once. not to mention great special effects for the 90s.
