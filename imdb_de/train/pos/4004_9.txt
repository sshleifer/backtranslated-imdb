"The Mother" is an extraordinary piece of film - it makes you think, it does not hit you - and in the end, it makes you think. Very open about the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (whom I knew only briefly about her performances in some Victoria Wood-led projects and considered her a good comedy) is really great here. Not the stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not so free-spirited and adventurous at first. She only plays her character with the right note that sounds true (well, that did me). Powerful occupation Great script. Renaissance of European cinema in fact;)
