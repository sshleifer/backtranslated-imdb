Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities. The acting and the story are wonderful if you can handle the concept. Those with weak physiques will have some difficulty, as the "worms" are realistic enough to throw more than a few spectators out of the audience. <br /> <br /> Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the limelight, the young Ty Panitz could get a serious turn on the screen in the next few years. <br/> <br/> Miss Eisenberg has grown from a cute face to a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic charisma. <br /> <br /> The story makes a spectacular use of bullying, friendship and fairness. It offers the opportunity to discuss these issues openly and openly while recalling a "rough" scene from the film.
