Atlantis: The Lost Empire features some of the best, smoothest animations and neatly written dialogues of any Disney movie I've ever seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I especially love Don Novello's language work on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad that the entire film moves about twice as fast as it would be appropriate - at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does not offer. He is average at best. After half of the film, there is a mediocre turn. That's all. It's still a great movie. Everyone should check it.
