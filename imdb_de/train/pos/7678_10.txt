I've just seen Holly along with another movie about trafficking and sexual exploitation of children called Trade at Film by the Sea International Film Festival. I have to say that Holly Trade blew out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic point of view, it is amazing. Sound mixing, camera angle, direction and acting are just right. <br /> <br /> In addition, dealing with the theme is tasteful and not exploitative. It presents the problem of sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both pedagogical and accurate. The filmmakers paid special attention to the detail and captured the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and trafficking in children. Too often, when it comes to such a topic, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to do all of this without getting into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen a moving crowd. If you only hear conversations after the screening, people ask what they can do personally to fight the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both because of its cinematic value and because of its theme.
