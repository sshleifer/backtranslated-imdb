First, no one can understand why this movie is rated so poorly. This is not just the first really horrible movie for a long time for me, which is pretty hard-boiled with a decade-long experience of horror, starting with passing dark journeys (ghost trains) as a kid. Second, actress Cheri Christian has a face that lets her hope she becomes the lead actress in important future images. Third, this woman is so incredibly beautiful that I propose that the directors retire all these Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and whatever the names of these short-lived incandescent lamps. Mrs. Christian is not a light but a sun. <br /> <br /> However, "dark remains" is also of considerable metaphysical significance. They believe that photographs of intermediate worlds between reality and "imagination", which are invisible to their own eyes, are not new. But I've never seen in a movie that these creatures are only visible to certain people and at certain times in the photographs. This means that the photo is not just an iconic image of reality (which makes reality a sign), but an alternative form of reality that can change, as the "real" reality can. As a sign, changing the image means affecting the photographed objects; H. The sign behaves like an object. In our ordinary world of perception, it is common for objects to change characters. For example, when a bird grows, its photo will show it with beard, not without, as before. The opposite, the changing of objects by signs would mean that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man. This is, quite simply, the case that happens with the photos of the main character in prison in this movie. This is new and we must be grateful for everything new in horror movies. Normally, you usually repeat and rearrange effects and functions that have been known since silent time.
