This is undoubtedly the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-all-that-moves type of FPS (which I do not usually like), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, Scryeeee ...") and higher everything an incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye, which allows you to see or hear events happening in the past at certain points in the games. The only game I had to pause because of some intense atmosphere regularly after a minute's play. I'm a big horror fanatic, especially of Clive Barker's stories and movies, and as I attend such a horror story, I long for more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more exciting story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fps fan and maybe the game was a bit short?)
