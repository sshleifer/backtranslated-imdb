I really like this movie, but it is a fact that you can not understand it if you are not from the former Yugoslavia. Most actors are now dead and these were the best actors in ex-Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was the former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balcanic nations. It could be a dreamland if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the spirit of the nation with their sick ideas.
