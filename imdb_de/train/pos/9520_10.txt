This is a nice movie. The true story of the bond between father and son. This is by far Tom Hanks at his best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has nice guy roles. In this film, he looks a bit meaty in this movie, but still smells like a rose, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this film was well put together. I also love the role when it's totally silent when Tom Hanks's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Roony's group. It is a bit worn and yet profound that there is no sound in this scene, just emotions. I love looking at John Rooney, the face of Paul Newman, when he realizes that he is Tom Rank's revenge and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I was overwhelmed and knew that I had to go out to get the video, and since then I've had my favorite actor in my collection of my ever-popular movies, so this movie has a special place in it me.
