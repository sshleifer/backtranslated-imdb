I have just watched "California" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. One might think that "Kalifornia" would belong with the recent spate of serial killer movies to the earlier films worth mentioning but not. If this movie had been released sometime between 1996 and 1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" differs significantly from most serial killer movies released in the late 1990s. It has an almost different atmosphere than most of today's serial killer movies like "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown a killer, but this person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to really learn something about it. "California" is a movie that actually tries to break that barrier and understand the criminal mind. It attempts to answer questions such as "Why do they do the things they do? Is it? Because of something that happened in her past she Feel therefore superior or powerful? Or do it because they like the thrill of Killens ? " "These are some of the things that" attempts to answer Kalifornia ", but also leaves room to figure things out for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce. When we meet at the beginning of the film for the first time, see we know that he's obviously a disturbed individual. When we see him for the first time, it's late at night. breakfast may be drunk. we see how he picks up a stone, throwing off a bridge and then lands on the windshield of a passing car . Pitt in this film is hard. It's always good to see him when he plays Psychos or really bad people. It's weird that this would later cause him to play a real idiot as in "12 Monkeys" and that he would be in David Fincher's "Seven" at the other end of the spectrum.
