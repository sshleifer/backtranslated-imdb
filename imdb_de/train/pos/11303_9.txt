Visconti's first film is characterized by its visual flair and impeccable technique, accompanied by Massimo Girotti as a handsome drifter and, above all, Clara Calamai as a fabulous, wild Giovanna. Repeatedly repeated as "The postman rings twice", but never better. I can not believe that this was the man's first movie! It shows a person's trust in the zenith of his career.
