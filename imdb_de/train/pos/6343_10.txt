Let me set the scene. It's the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the cinema. I am with my friend who decides what to see. We are looking for a movie that will start soon and "The Grinch" will be released. We buy tickets that do not know what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (I may add, is my lead actor around the world) was as Grinch in this best movie by Ron Howard (next) absolutely great about Apollo 13). The way this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music were just incredible. It really brought this childhood movie to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of the grin. As we all know, the Grinch is a terrible person who just can not stand Christmas. He lives high above Whoville and has never mixed well with the citizens. But a little girl will drastically change The Grinch's view of life and others. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by glamorous new actress Taylor Momsem) meets Grinch, who finds the nice part of it right away. She tries to break through the barrier and help the Grinch move into the inhabitants of the cities and mingle with the people. All in all, this movie is a laugh for the whole family, kids and parents. ONE FIRST 10/10. Well done, Jim. <br /> <br />
