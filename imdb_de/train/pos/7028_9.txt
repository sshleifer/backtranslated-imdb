I saw this as a random predecessor, I've seen it twice now. I enjoyed it a lot, no stupid thought-provoking thoughts, just good conversation, good songs, good characters and a feel-good movie. Highly recommended for those of us who enjoy watching movies and not sharing them here. I did not know that Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sultry. The songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really enjoyable to hear and Jason Alexander knocking his feet off is the complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman and is very good. Tyne Daley still reminds me of Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still had that memory in them. All in all, I loved it and will buy it when it's available
