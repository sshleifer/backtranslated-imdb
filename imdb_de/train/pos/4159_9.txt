Anyone who thinks that anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a beautiful film that tells about Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death and grow up as well. The journey on the train is a kind of Tetsuros journey from youth to masculinity. The music and the visual style of the movie are a bit dated (you can say it's a 70's movie) and the animation is only slightly better than the average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong that it really does not matter. A must for every animation fan!
