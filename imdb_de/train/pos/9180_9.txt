I felt obliged to watch Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke's adaptation of "Jane Eyre" from 1983, as I had just written an article about 2006's BBC "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I I watched as I approached homework. <br /> <br /> I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone is bathed in a bright white, flying light, which in some scenes casts shadows behind the figures on the wall. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly received. I felt like I was listening to a high school piece. <br /> <br /> And the pancake make-up is way too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not convey the gothic mood of the novel. You are too fussy, even Martha Stewart. I can not see Brontes Rochester following such Martha-Stewart collusion. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in a cave-like darkness that was very appropriate to the gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all these objections ... this is not just the best "Jane Eyre" I've seen, it could be the best adaptation of a novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite her technical flaws, made the feeling of "Jane" reading Eyre "for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say it's too For me, someone who appreciated the book and did not need it to be less "wordy" or less "Christian" or more sexual is the fidelity of this version to the novel that Bronte actually wrote, the best capital. <br /> Bronte wrote a damn good book, there's a reason why it took more than 150 years while other slimmer, sexier and simpler lyrics disappeared. <br /> < br /> As a fan of "Jane Eyre," I have long been biased against Timothy Dalton as Rochester, Rochester is not beautiful, Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly pair of literature, and Timothy Dalton is nothing, if not surprisingly handsome br /> <br /> But Dalton gives as Rochester a fascination performance. He just blew me away. I have never seen anything like his absolute dedication to the role, text, dialogue, and love of Rochester to Jane. Dalton brings the Rochester of the page into a trembling life on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Rochester is said to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary trail when he said, "Enough!" then Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary here more than once. You really can not say if he will hurt Jane or himself in desperation. Rochester's superiority, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys everything, sometimes seconds. It is amazing. <br /> <br /> And here's the most important thing - the actor who plays Rochester must convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, with an ugly, life-destroying mystery. > <br /> No other actor I've seen is trying to convey that black hole of despair in this part, as Timothy Dalton does. The current fan favorite Toby Stephens does not even try it. Dalton strikes out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton playing in a single Rochester pub, I would say, "This guy is trouble, do not even look at him." He is so radioactive with muted agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only the best Jane I've ever seen, she's one of the few Janes the producers were willing to book. No, people who only know "Jane Eyre" from the 2006 version have described Bronte * no * a statuesque, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. Charlotte Brontes Jane is rather poor, simple, dark and small and NOT pretty. Zelah has a small mouth, tight-fitting eyes and a small nose. She is really "small". She is not a model. And she's the best Jane, the truest in the book. <br /> <br /> Some described them as cold or boring. No, she is faithful to the book. Brontes Jane is not a fervent mother, she is a protected, robbed teenager whose inner passions come into play only in key moments, as Zelah does here. The book Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, and attentively, if you really want to explore their depths. You have to watch Zelah here to find out who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to have seen more fires in Zelah in a key scene, but that's one in five hours which is otherwise very good. Despite its closeness to the text, this version, like any other version I've seen, does not shy away from fully explaining the obvious Christian themes in "Jane." "Christianity is not a random subtext in Jane Eyre, it is central, and Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, giving her a subversive, countercultural way of reading and living, seemingly damned, pinched life Christianity and a Christian God who convinces the poor, simple, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of an important marriage proposal are not clear. <br /> < In any case, Charlotte Bronte has written an outstanding, complex, rich novel, and that adaptation of it, of all the ones I've seen, refills and honors. The novel is the best of every adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that do not fully honor the book end up being an annoying task in many places. If you do not care what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child molestation, o the hypocrisy of a culture based on looks and money, you'll be adjusting much of the book as people move fast to get to the kissing scenes between them Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte has written - about Jane's experience at Lowood and her relationship with St. John - is part of what Jane's relationship with Rochester is explosive and unforgettable as it is.
