First of all, I have to say that I made the mistake of seeing the election films in sequence. I say unhappy, because after seeing election 2 for the first time, choice seems a bit disappointing. Both films are gangster epics of similar form. And while Election is a pleasing piece of cinema ... it's not nearly as good as its sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first election episode we are shown the two competitors for the chairman. Big D and Lok. After some scenes of discussion among the "uncle's" about who should get the title of chairman, they decide (almost unanimously) that Lok (Simon Yam) will lead the triads. Suffice to say that this does not work very well with rival Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai). To influence the takeover, Big D kidnaps two of his uncles to bring the electoral body to his side. This has catastrophic consequences and leads the Triads into a war that matters. Lok is determined to become chairman, but will not become official until he can regain the Dragon Head Baton, a material account of the chairman's power. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang), has hidden the staff somewhere in mainland China. The race begins to see who can catch up with him first. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the recovery of the Baton. As the two aspiring leaders search for them, they have to evade police and opponents, leading to one of the outstanding scenes in Election, which involves a subordinate named Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete, and many baddies. Nick Cheung's presence is eye-catching, to say the least ... I wonder if that influenced the director Johhnie To when he made the second choice as he adds more of Jet's character in the sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung shows a scene where he is stolen, I must not miss giving to the other actors in the film. Election has a great ensemble of well thought out and subtle performances. Simon Yam is his usually glorious self and the movie also benefits from heavy-weight HK actors like Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the undervalued Suet Lam. There are really no weak links in acting and you could easily believe that they see real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, Johnnie Tos's eye is one of Election's most impressive features for the camera. There are some really eye-catching shots in the movie, and it goes without saying that To definitely knows how to set his shots, as the viewer is confronted with a range of innovative and quite brilliant camera positioning and angles. All this makes Election a great-looking movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the movie are mostly due to the large number of characters involved in Election. It will be a bit hard to follow, because the movie is so full of characters that are not integrated into the plot. While the sequel focuses more on the two candidates, the first choice offers the electoral process as a whole, with tons of uncle, subordinates and police officers. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it had taken a little longer, if more time had been spent on the inner workings of the triad, or if director Johnnie To had shut down the necessary elements and explained them further. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: All in all, this is a wonderfully brutal movie with a great cast, great alignment, and a laid-back, fast-paced beat. It's just a little more complicated than it had to be.
