This is wrongly annulled with Darkwing Duck. Disney has been declining since Tarzan and we need such a show to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?). The theme is also a catchy tune. Of all the villains, all of whom are great, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice-overs in the jungle book, which is not bad at all. In fact, it's pretty inspiring! The animation was just right, and the script had a lot of joke that has been lacking in animation for years. Please bring back this show! 10.9. Bethany Cox
