"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is as entertaining as animated Batman films. <br /> <br /> The animations are true to the feel of the comic books, but they are lighter in spirit than the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks very similar to before, but now he looks less imposing. The Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by the less nervous, youthful Tim Drake Robin. Kevin Conroy, as usual, calls Batman's voice better than most live-action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa has played a much more decent speaking role than I expected. <br /> <br /> Like the live action Batman movies, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the bad guys. My eternal favorite, the penguin, is here. His design is slimmer than before, and he has more to do with the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the '60s than the Danny DeVito portrayal of Batman Returns. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the voice of the penguin. The penguin, after all, is portrayed as a clever sophistication, as is most common in comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a curse that is far more memorable than the forgotten version in "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a descent secret to solve, which brings the "detective" back to "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" stands for). The revolution of the riddle is a wonderfully insidious twist. <Br /> <br /> The score adds to the mysterious ambience of the movie. It sounds like a mixture of the score from "Poirot" and the score from "Mission: Impossible". All in all, it's more entertaining than an average cartoon.
