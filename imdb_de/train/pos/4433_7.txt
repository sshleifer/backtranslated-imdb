The story: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who is doing a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and joie de vivre fascinate Bob, who recently had a very traumatic experience. But her life is not as easy as it seems. Through Kathleen Bob gets into a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to gain confidence? <br /> <br /> Rating: The dialogue in this film is very natural and the story unfolds well, though it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character 'psychology' had been worked out a bit more , Why do these people do what they do? What motivates your decisions? This gives a film depth and something that I can think about from my point of view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify it. So you do not get to know the characters on this deeper level. The actors do a good job of playing in a very natural and "believable" way, but I think it would be better for the movie if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, Ms. Working with the Camera is Beautiful and there are some great pictures of nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
