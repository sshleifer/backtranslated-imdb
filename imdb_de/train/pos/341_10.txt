I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. The cast was excellent, the plot was thrilling and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! I would call this one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! The girls in it were really cute too, especially Denise Richards. She was very playful throughout the movie and gave her character OOMPH!
