Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably exaggerated (but he played similar roles in other films like "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the movie was "thrilled". > <br /> * mild spoiler ahead *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in his films, but I remember several other examples. I'll avoid naming the killer, but I think it's necessarily obvious because the plot requires "thriller." <br /> <br /> A very successful but dated film Noire (for example: Everyone smoked like crazy and the police were in contrast to today's Gore festivals.) No bodies were shown in the familiar tableau format short scenes of that time were created. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
