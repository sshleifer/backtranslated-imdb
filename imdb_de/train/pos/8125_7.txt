Things to Come is a rarity, a movie about ideas. Many films show a vision of the future, but only a few try to show us how this future came about. The first part of the movie, when War comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, in the release year, movie audiences laughed at reports that enemy aircraft were attacking England, the appeasement was at its peak, Wells' forecast proved too soon.) Par modeling work is most effective. The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and the ruins of Everytown are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the boss's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st Century is an equally striking design. The drama in 21st century history is not compelling - perhaps this was a failed attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of that time with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, the model work, which depicts angry crowds storming over elevated walkways, ridiculously bad, could have been done much better, even with '30s technology. This is especially annoying because the scenes of the huge plane are very convincing. This is achieved through the great speech of Raymond Massey, who completes the film - rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been so well expressed. Massey's last question is more important today than ever before in a time of severely restricted manned space travel. The scene is supported by the intoxicating music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose surname I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely awful and have serious technical issues. Most versions have released a rather interesting assembly of futuristic workers and machines that will take us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the entire movie.
