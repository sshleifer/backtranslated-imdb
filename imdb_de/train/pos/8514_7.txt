When an orphanage manager goes on vacation, his father takes over the details of the center and hires the children. If a wealthy couple has managed to get a couple with a nice apartment and a great life, the idea is to accept this idea, which was tailor-made for them. Why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with a trio of hairy carpet doorbells? In no case would people like these two children need to make life wonderful. In this movie, it looks like the real world works that way, but I'm the image of doubt.
