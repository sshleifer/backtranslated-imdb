This is a wonderful new crime series that brought together three old Stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) when retired detectives were brought back to settle old cases under the guidance of younger career-oriented Amanda Redman. The three quirky, cranky old policemen make up a brilliant team. They apply twenty-year-old investigative methods to a police force that has since evolved - sometimes with effect, sometimes to the horror of its high-ranking officers. The three are sympathetically represented, warts and all. There are great comic scenes and some very moving ones, as each of the three must cope with the aging and inheritance of their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we're promised another series next year, each of the characters has evolved.) Widower James Bolam can not cope with the untimely death of his wife Lothario Denis Waterman learns his Even the obsessed Alun Armstrong will be helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and continue to take the drugs! - while Amanda Redman faces the all-too-familiar conflict between a life and a career. The storylines have been interesting, though quite dependent on the wonders of DNA testing, but the interplay of four of Britain's top actors has made the series unmistakable.
