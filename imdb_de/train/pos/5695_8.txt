Some movies survive almost exclusively with originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything into an almost feverish mood, but does not make it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to choose to cover up a weak script, but to reproduce the drug-dependent reality accurately. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is a very strange way to work on his actors. Most characters are constantly on the up and often because they are pretty ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a hustler capable of manipulating and controlling. Not an insult to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems to dominate only the drastically weak. Nevertheless, it is an amazing achievement. Comparing this to Kilmer's more "Hollywood" roles as in "The Saint", it seems to prove that he is much more at home in edgy indie films. <br /> <br /> The actors are the main force that holds everyone together. There are several small performances that are particularly striking - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow have only limited screen time besides their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give their roles a crazy, overwhelming energy. <br /> <br /> Originally, I declined to watch "Wonderland" because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murder mystery and as such - it's excellent. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
