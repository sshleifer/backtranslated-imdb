In this movie, the year 2022 looks very similar to the seventies. This is amusing at first, but the viewer soon realizes how much this decadent, futuristic world is different in spite of the apparitions, how many things we take for granted may not be available. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact in a strange way without tact, manners or respect. I think that's intentional, not bad. Anyone who has witnessed the social changes of the 60s and 70s can safely assume that the inhabitants of an overcrowded city will behave like this until 2022. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the action scenes, except for the death of the priests: too cheap for the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But the great scenes and ideas - such as the death of Sol, the handling of insurgents and corpses, the "furniture" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film. 8 out of 10 points.
