Zombi 3 has an interesting story. First, it's a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi 2, with Zombie 2, of course, a marketing ploy that makes people think it's a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Confusing enough? Basically, none of the films has anything to do with each other, but who cares if he makes money. I think Fulci himself started to worry about half of Zombi 3's production when he decided to go out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to provide the film with additional scenes to extend the term. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3s Plot is your typical zombie award. Scientists develop a serum on a Philippine island, terrorists steal it, trigger a plague and rampage of zombies. The scientists want to create an antidote, while the military wants to mop everyone without prejudice. There are also short insertions by a radio DJ who preaches about dealing with the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall I really liked this movie. I have heard terrible things, but I find the stupid dialogue very pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness of pollution, damaged military, the man who plays God. I feel that at one point this was a serious movie, but it turned in a strange direction, presumably when Mattei came aboard. <br /> <br /> Aside from demolishing other zombie flicks, it reminded a lot of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the radio DJ breaking the good news: "If you see the men in white suits and gas masks, run to them for help." This is of course played with the pictures of the men in white who are tearing down zombies. Later, they steal a scene from Crazies, in which one of the normal, uncontaminated people is mistakenly killed. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is pretty good in this scene, with zombie hordes on every corner. How cool is it Let me count the ways? 1. Zombie birth 2. Flying zombie head 3. Zombie birds. 4. Zombie without legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the machete madman at the gas station. He was a bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building and tried to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> favorite quote ?? When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientist asks, "Do not you think the ashes fall to the ground and contaminate everything as soon as it's in the air?" The Sargeant replies boldly: "Now you're talking about science fiction." He also continues to mention the "science fiction" that is told by the scientists themselves at the end, when all die. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, trailers and interviews, especially with Mattei, who insists that he directs 40% of the scenes can not yet remember which or other important details. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A must for zombie and fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
