Eddie Murphy spends his time searching for lost children. So when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to save this child from the clutches of evil itself. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, she never feels tacky in the movie despite the hilarity of the comedy; Charles Dance compensates for the comedy with its very serious and dark characterization of the evil that holds the child hostage. The Golden Child is very funny, action-packed and really sexy, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
