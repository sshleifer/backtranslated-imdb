This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and asks you to be attentive. There is much to like here. The director seems to be interested in taking apart some of the tired cinematic conventions. Unlike many other American cinemas, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie. The DVD includes many bonus features and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers who are still confused after watching it for the first time. When the film was screened in Sundance, more than a few viewers became uncomfortable and angry. This is a coffee movie on Sunday morning, not a party movie on Friday night. For the dedicated viewer, it is a treasure chest.
