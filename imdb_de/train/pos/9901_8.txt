This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s Slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of all. So when I saw that it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It shows Caroline Munro from both dr. Phibes movies (she was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Journey of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and Faceless /> <br /> Of the people behind brought to you. Do not open until Christmas and plays. Here's my thoughts on that ... <br /> <br /> It opens on April Fool's Day, when a bunch of kids play a fancy prank on the school nerd who promises him sex in the shower and him public humiliation and a face on the toilet gives (while he is naked!). The coach puts an end to it, but both parties swear revenge. But the cool kids burn the nerd alive. <br /> <br /> Cut into the future, and it's the reunion of high school, or so they think (bwahahha?). The only ones with invitations were the gang that burned the kid, and April Fool's joke (or really, a day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), but they do not see the coincidence and hang out at the door of the school until the onset of the Darkness. Then they finally break into school and it starts to storm. <br /> <br /> Inside you will find food / drinks and a small shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings as well as Marty's (the nerds) lockers and yearbook. You also find the old black caretaker / caretaker who spends his time, "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want to bother, sir!" and then killed immediately. Pretty pointless character, but he is still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes a page from Aliens book in a delicious way that you just have to see! That's when everyone notices they're dying and they start to freak, except Shirley, who decides it's best to bathe in the old-school showers at a time like this. Of course, it pours out blood and acid and their face melts off (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kill everyone while wearing a fool mask .. What's your plan? "We just have to stay awake and wait until noon, Marty will not kill us at noon!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive the night? Who will live and who will die? And why do all bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, full of clich√©s (car does not start, DAMMIT!) And just slasher fun. Not to mention that they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to you all! And not to mention, it has a spin off! 1989's Cutting Class is a spin off of this Slasher gem, and this movie begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people who have sex want the guy but the girl does not quit "Talk dirty with me, Frank !!" she screams "Um ... tits!" "Dirtier" "Uh ... tits. F * ck. Tits. Breasts. F * ck." It seems to work for them and to their climax the killer kills them both!
