Honestly, I do not understand why this movie was such a big "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone has certainly lost none of her charisma and "touch" since "Basic Instinct". I chose 10 for this film and I'll tell you why: this time the game opens in London. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class - attacked. She "screws your brain" as Catherine with such a capacity that in the end you are not quite sure who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical part of the film is concerned: Only a real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone had been a bit younger, but she still looks pretty stunning and has improved only in terms of her charisma. Your B-rate "assistants" are not that bad either, though I would have liked a few bigger names for the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are pretty good improvements in the baseline. I think this is a far better thriller than many of the trash-hewn bastards Hollywood is now happily distributing. The plot is great, it's technically easy to see, you do not snore in the middle of the movie and the most important thing is that your health is on.
