It is reminiscent of the writings of Stephen King and the memorable childhood that is filled with stories of terror like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no terror in this childhood that each of the friends - who are still friends 20 years later - can remember or seem to suffer. Down the line everything is described as friendly shaking, perhaps periodically as "picking up" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * fear * because the film is embedded and the participants describe the relationships later in life - we only see young people who are essentially the same people. Mature, but basically still the same people and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Totally amazing! Not only for the fact that people can grow up relatively unscathed by social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this regard, this film is a small pearl - it is believed that this was the intent of the film: a portrait of casual emotions that connect people. What can be seen in contrast to late-year films that depict the dark side of childhood - the violent inhibitions at Bowling for Combine - that comes to mind slightly, but since the mid-1980s along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by thousands of commercials, animations and series aimed directly at children). Several films and documentaries were successful in showing the dark sides of growing up - abuse, loneliness, pursuit of perfection - which resulted in adults with dark and twisted heads /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, have a look! <br /> <br /> Thanks for that. OR the counterweight illusion ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
