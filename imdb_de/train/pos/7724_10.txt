Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beats everyone else with special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has horror (not graphic), romance, robot, witty juxtaposition, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago in a revival with a new print, and I was amazed at how well it is held today. I thought the electronics of the '40s would look hokey, but it looked somehow futuristic and modern. Ann Francis (here) (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat will still be a climb out of me. <br /> <br /> The Krell monster that appears in the beams still scares Bejebees. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that the "Big Bird of the Galaxy" has probably modeled much of "Star Trek" from this movie. No one yet has Robby to beat the robot in terms of his personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie is the standard all other sci-fi movies up to! Have to measure! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the haunting electronic score that has captured us all on needles.
