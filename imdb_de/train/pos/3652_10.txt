I started to watch a replay of this television movie on a Sunday afternoon and thought it was just another stupid airplane catastrophe. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is a smart political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most television films. It might as well have made its debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, including veterans Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga is one of her best performing CIA specialists, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is thoroughly convincing. In fact, the last hour is so full of plot twists and tension that you can not leave your seat for a second. If you have the chance to see this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be rewarded rich!
