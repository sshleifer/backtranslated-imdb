I had reached the end and almost screamed, "No, no, no, no! It can not end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The involvement of the dishwashers? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's Comeuppance? The" zombie "? Saved by his father? And what about the head ??????? "ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the performers had gone on and I have to say, I know that it probably does not fit the vision of Lars von Trier, but I would like to drop by substitute actors just to see the end he has had planned! Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have not seen a more selfish, selfish character on screen yet! But I could overlook a change in the actors ... I just need to know how it ends!
