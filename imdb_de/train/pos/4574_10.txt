Let me start by saying that I have cerebral palsy and I went into this movie, expecting that I have to consider lead performance. I halfway left the theater convinced that they had occupied an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, although I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think that's his name) being especially honored as a young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brazen, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and reckless, in other words, human. This movie, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP. Not a complete portrait, but beautiful examples of people with disabilities as human beings. We recommend.
