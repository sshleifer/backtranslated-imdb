I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. If you see it on a big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those TV screens that have the most cinemas), with an excellent sound system, you'll always improve the cinematic experience as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and you into the story draws in the picture. <br /> <br /> The film shows a series of characters that are loosely connected. Their stories intersect at specific locations, and the plethora of storylines reminded me of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. However, the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which forms the backdrop for the entire film. It houses the characters, contains the sidewalks and streets on which they run, and sets the background atmosphere for all events in beautifully filmed scenes. Again and again, the film returns to certain topics (shoes) for example) and essentially Salazar makes his metaphors more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. He combines the city's views with the characters' attitudes and elegantly blends the feeling of the scene into the background. A number of talented actors help him to portray the most diverse characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin Anita crosses the street for the first time. This does not work on small screens, but I have goosebumps on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The message of the movie is very positive and therefore the movie is easy and funny. The music along the movie is usually pop with some instrumental pieces (I hope one day to put my hand on the soundtrack, though I seriously doubt I'll do that). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10.
