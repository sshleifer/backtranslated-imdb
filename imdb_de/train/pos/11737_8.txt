OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way. It was deliberately stupid and one of the better "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are deliberately bad, but are delivered in such a way that they hit all the right notes with me. The minor characters were pretty flat and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works fine. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is central here. She is gracious and charming. Over this acting talent she had physical qualities that were frankly mind-blowing. Only a few men could contradict this. The parts that show her character were also some of the funniest scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first to the last scene. <br /> <br /> Very fans of comedy and fans recommended by beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.
