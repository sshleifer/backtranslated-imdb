THE SECRET OF KELLS is perhaps the most exquisite movie I've seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the stunning 2D sequence) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a fullness of color that is a treat for the senses. KELLS is so lavish - almost gothic (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in the overall perspective, decorated in Celtic and lighted design, but the characters are so simple and engaging - AND everything works wonderfully. You fall in love with the characters as soon as you meet them. They are drawn from every detail of the story and from every brushstroke. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget / VERY small crew movie is absolutely amazing. The reason to support our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking and the enthusiasm among the colleagues who have recommended this film is spreading like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS for his numerous awards, the Annie nomination and the current Oscar qualification run. They are all very deserving nods, in fact ...
