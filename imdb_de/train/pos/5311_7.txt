John Waters most accessible film to date is one of his better, considering he restricts all the hassle and extreme vulgarity that seems to cover most of his previous work. Sure, the nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it's presented in a way that can not be considered too evil or repugnant. Due to some great casting options, this film has really shown the stupidity associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and light-hearted (if that's possible for Waters), this is one of the movies I would see on a rainy day.
