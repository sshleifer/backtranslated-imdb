Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I've ever seen! There were some of the greatest rock'n'roll songs ever written and performed by 15 very talented singers / artists. It also had (in my opinion) the most experienced surprise on Real TV. It actually got me to shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! In the 13 weeks of this television competition, the audience got to know and get to know all participants. After 30 episodes, the remaining participants seemed more like friends than just a few strangers who competed in a reality television show. And the fact that INXS was and is one of the greatest rock'n'roll bands of all time has added to the emotional excitement of this wonderful reality series. If you have not recorded the series, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is a great alternative.
