This is such a great movie! The low rating here does not matter. I really have no idea where that came from, they need to discuss another movie. Because I absolutely loved it and it was a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was so original and charming. I really can not imagine anything bad about it. Maybe it has to be "your kind of thing," but I saw that with my sister and mother, and we were all excited about it. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good, and that's hard to achieve in a movie like this one. But I found all the characters very interesting and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Dougray Scott and found his new "dark" role very interesting. It's really hard to make me like a bad guy, but this time I had absolutely no problem with it. Even more, I worshiped him. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama, who also has a good dose of love and tragedy, should definitely visit this movie, no question! If you want to see a movie with 80% bloodshed, you should rent something else. But I guess the title tells that already. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good work !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Have fun!
