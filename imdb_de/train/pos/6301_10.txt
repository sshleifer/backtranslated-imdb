I'm attending a filmmaking symposium, and this movie was shown after we had already seen a not so good movie and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the entire audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the movie hilarious in all right places and I loved the quirky characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
