This movie is excellent and wonderful. Prince's Academy Award for Music was well earned (many people do not know he won one). I think that this is one of the best movies you can watch on DVD in the evening. A great surprise: Prince does his job well and can transmit pain in front of the camera well. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool landmark movie.
