When I rode from Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson City, Yukon, a few years ago, and was impressed by the scenery, I can only wish that this film, even though it has beautiful colors and scenic views, actually shot would have been. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but still not the place where the movie takes place. If the story moves to Dawson, I feel that Anthony Mann, who has used the outdoor areas so well, could have made the most of it if he had shot on location. James Stewart is here again a man who fights in himself, one side of him does not want to interfere and help the people who stand in his way to make money, and the other side just can not ignore the murders. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care who she enters, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Mann is a great director of the shootouts, but the highlight of the film is how good he is in the outdoor shots. He uses the outdoors as best he can, and the winter landscape helps him, the prevailing white, as it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man from Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional Western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
