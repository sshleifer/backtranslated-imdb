I've been a Jodie Foster fan since we were both kids from their Disney years. I loved her tomboys in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was such a big departure from all this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actresses of that era have switched to sex Disguised as a comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teenagers struck by the strong allure of temptation and Addiction were dragged to their demise. That was not Porky. This was not a Halloweed. This was a dark and powerful story about the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, it is a story that still happens daily throughout the country. This movie could be played (with a current soundtrack) and still be completely relevant. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made. It is tired in some places, not all performances are particularly outstanding. But Jodie Foster continued to show her skills as a real adult actress (a trend began when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
