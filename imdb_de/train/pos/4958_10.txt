Full disclosure: I am a cynic. I like my end sad and dry my handkerchief. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith's new movie Happiness looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> Why on earth did I like "10 Items or Less"? Maybe it was the double espresso I had knocked down before the show. Or (more likely) maybe it was even the case that even die-hard movie fans could occasionally use a shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And it's cute. From the moment that "Him" meets "Scarlet" (an event that meets "nicely meet" by a Nora Ephron), the gaze is thrown on an intimate journey in which two strangers learn about the path of life take care of. (Beautifully supported by Phedon Papamichaels camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument of the film is that it is too far-fetched. Is the movie farfetched? I dont know. You tell me. I have not met Adrian Brody on the market yet. (But not for lack of trials). Do I enjoy thinking about the adventures that might arise if this momentous event were to take place? Damn right I'm doing. , .this is where most reviews of "10 Items or Less" come up short. , They do not take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. And hell, sometimes it's worth the price of taking them to live 82 minutes.
