This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this movie, me too. The music was fantastic too. No, the horses do not speak, instead the story of Spirit is told. And to hear a story told from the perspective of a horse, when seeing is fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all "spirit". This film gives you a feeling of family, home and friends. I would have to say that my 4-year-old boy and my 5-year-old girl were really touched by this movie, and even when it did, they laughed so much and in the end they cheered for spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and let this heartwarming story lift you. Your children will love it. I think you will too.
