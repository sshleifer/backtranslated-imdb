That's what I call growth film. Every character is different and better in the end - and all because a woman knows that the place they chose is a "tub of love." Josie Lawrence, known as Comedienne, shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this movie are turning from being selfish to better men. The book has remained very faithful to the novel, which is a plus in my book because I am a librarian. The scenery is breathtaking and the message of love is real.
