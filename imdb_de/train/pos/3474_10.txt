Just for Jared Harris' outstanding performance by John Lennon, this movie is worth seeing. It does not matter that Harris Lennon does not exactly resemble. His manners, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Scene: Lennon verbally sparing with a stuttering fan at a local caf√© whether Paul McCartney & Wings's "Silly Love Songs" earned # 1 status in America.
