This is a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat who have to live with someone for a short time, but the animals do not understand it and they flee and seek the family alone. The cat's name is Sassy and lives up to its name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is the older and smarter dog who perceives things. Put these three on an adventure and it makes a happy and fun time. There are no special effects when the mouth is moving, so it is not cheesy at all. It's the best animal movie I've ever seen. It's a really good movie for families.
