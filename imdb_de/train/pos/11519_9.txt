The only reason I did not give these 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. However, if you've ever dreamed of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most lifelike films I have ever seen. And magical. The show is great, the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of the movies that revolves around "cult" status. I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, others can not finish it. Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible, I think about Alan Arkin's role in this film. He certainly wished he would make more films.
