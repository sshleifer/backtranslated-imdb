I only went to this movie because I was dragged there and I would have left immediately because the audience was mostly older people and I felt out of place. The film, however, was absolutely fascinating and by no means geared towards older people. The characters were all very real and believable and I talked for hours about the movie, the characters and the storyline. There are some pretty compelling scenes, but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better. All in all, this is a great and valuable movie - a bit off the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not be enjoyed by people who prefer the mainstream. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
