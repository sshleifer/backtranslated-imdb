At 4:00 pm on the weekdays, a new schedule is currently available for METOO, right after "Maverick" and right before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I ever really know something I've seen an episode of it when it was originally started, but I'm really fascinated. Unconventional, unusual, surreal stories in the midst of a mythical West. A kind of "Naked City" of the Westerns. <br /> <br /> And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I've married a space monster") <br /> <br /> It ran over for EIGHT SEASONS too 200 episodes from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming, as a trail boss Gil Favor, the sturdiest man, has lived quite remarkably ever, with a samurai code of honor and just the right balance of tenacity and openness , I would choose him every day for the president. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood stands out as his impulsive right-hand "rowdy" Yates. In addition, the veteran Western actor and country musician (the immortal "One-Eyed, One-Horned, Flying Purple People Eater") features Sheb Wooley as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a chef one could wish for as a "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there is this great theme song played by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between the theme and the "Maverick" theme, I spend all day listening to Western theme songs.) <br /> <br /> I look forward to every episode; I collect the whole set. Having a good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed as you wait to see if the guys solve their difficulties in front of the commercial. <br /> <br /> "roles, roles", rollin '...
