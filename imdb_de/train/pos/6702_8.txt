Although there are no new episodes, it is rarely shown. I loved the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I've never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh. And why did the aunts have to disappear from the show forever? I'm sure the end was perfect. However, there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that she decides on her wedding day between Erin and Harvey! I really hope she picks Harvey! And may I say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad he's too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are a lot of little "stupid" things for the show, such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs, and all cast is listening to theirs Kind of stupid. In addition, the cat starts to really get lame as the show continues, the jokes just became stupid and the things the audiocontrolled "audience" would laugh at would make me think it was so lame. Do not get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the show lost its "magic", so to speak, as the show went on. I applaud all casts, though I knew that the girl from Soleil Moon Frye had no taste and she was a terrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or one of the cast members is doing now for this matter, now that the show is over.
