I got it out of a library on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. Many tight, expressionist cinematographic works, an equally tight script and two great actors merge into a very fine film piece. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but for the real movie enthusiast. If Hollywood ever gets their dirty hands, I'm sure it will ruin it. A selection all around. Other posters here have sung more than enough, so I do not have to worry about copying their parents. Just take her and my advice and do not miss this gem. Call it what you like. I call it well entertained for two hours. Read my lips: Do not miss it.
