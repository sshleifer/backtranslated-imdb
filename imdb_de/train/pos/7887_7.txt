If you're a hardcore Freddy fan, you may not like him. This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason it keeps itself is the background story of Freddy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's always great in Nightmare movies is the death scenes. But the death scenes were very crappy. The visual effects were great and the drama was ok, but the background story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story closes in this circle. <br /> <br /> I read bad reviews but I enjoyed that despite the many mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Last Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dreammaster. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the show. Here is Freddy fully explained, but that's all there is. Next on my list is Wes Craven's New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
