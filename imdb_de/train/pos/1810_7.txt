I can understand why some people like this movie and why some people do not. But I really like it, even though I have noticed some good and not so impressive parts. The animation was really excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi (I was physically sick when I read what happened to her) (I have "morons in particular, surrounded by morons "Loved") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy only had the same glamor, but I loved King Gator and his song. Part of the film is very insistent, like Annabelle's "You can never come back", which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some things that I did not like so much. The story tended to get awkward and blurry, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that would bother little children, but the end is very poignant. The biggest mistake, however, was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. With the exception of "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives," none of them stand out, and Burt Reynolds can not sing, and Dom DeLuise has sung much better. All in all, an observable movie that could have been more, but definitely memorable, and I'd definitely take another look at it. 10.7. Bethany Cox
