Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He treats misunderstandings of history and truths that are no longer well known. I would like to see more of this show. It is very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to convey his points. He explained that the person who actually drove the midnight ride from Paul Revere was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name of Revere because he sounded better. <br /> <br /> I've watched Robert Wuhl for many years since he did stand-up comedy and all the way to "Arli $$" HBO He's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I strongly recommend that you watch an episode of this show. It's worth your time.
