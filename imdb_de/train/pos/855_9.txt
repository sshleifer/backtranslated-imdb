This movie is fantastic. Finally well-written characters that you can love for the good and the bad. Pierce Brosnan is totally hysterical in this self-driving role. I think it's the best he has ever done. He has done other roles that have been able to accomplish this kind of full-fledged work. I nearly died as he walked through the hotel lobby in underwear and boots. Even Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a sought-after couple, but also actors. Kinnear is so stupid sympathetic that his turn in the end is really enjoyable. They give good actors good work to play and they give us back a little more.
