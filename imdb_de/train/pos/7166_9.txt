Holes, the novel, was imposed on me in a training course. I did not think I would like a children's book. Besides, the other books I had to read for class were really bad. But to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It's really one of the best-written novels I've ever read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it attractive for teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, will leave a better person. I can not quite say that for the movie, but I'm glad they usually got it right. I do not think that viewers of the movie will go away as enriched, but they will certainly entertain without the side effect of being stupid when sitting down. It's a smart story that is told very well. I think it's moving a bit too fast. The novel needs more time to develop the characters. And the flashbacks come in and out so fast that they do not have much time to register. Interracial romance in the past feels smarter and more banal than in the novel. And the end that holds all loose threads together seems very ridiculous. In the novel it is exactly the same, but there is a sense of the absurd that does not quite exist in the film. It works much better. I also do not like the variety of pop songs. I wish Disney did not see it as a necessity to sell soundtracks. The cast is consistently excellent, from the little kids to the old pros. Jon Voight is especially great. Not sure why we need Catwoman and the Fonze. 10.9.
