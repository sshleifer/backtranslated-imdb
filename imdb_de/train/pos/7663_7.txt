A Full Moon production logo is usually a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I tried it. <br /> <br /> It is not bad. Not great, but that's different. The film involves a fight with a mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the worldly world, which he makes successful. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and seeks a companion guarding a fortress. The guard, however, was dazzled. His eyes are spoiled pits. So the magician goes with his hands over the other's eyes and hey, presto! His eyes were restored! This type of healing seems to work only with eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate some animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> However, the picture is not bad at all, although it is similar to a comic. Dr. Mordred's more "human" adventures are okay, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I have seen much worse.
