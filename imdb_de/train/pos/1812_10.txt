This is one of the greatest movies ever, perhaps the greatest movie of all time. I had forgotten the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an add on television for ADGTH and it brought back nice memories when I saw it as a kid. And when I saw it a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. I do not usually like animated family movies, but this one is special. This is the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie always touches my heart and makes me very sad, but that makes this movie amazingly better than all the garbage that comes today for children's movies. I mean, the movie is rated G and it's about two dogs involved in gambling. There is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell in the movie. What I believe makes the movie good to great. I mean, movies do not bring children reality today, and in this movie, they did that. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
