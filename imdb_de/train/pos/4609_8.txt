Probably Jackie Chan's best movie in the 1980s and the one who put him on the map. The extent of this self-directed police drama can be seen in the opening and closing scenes in which a squatter's village and shopping center are demolished. There are clearly differences between the original Chinese version and the synchronized English version, with many of the jokes failing to get into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars that do not harm their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that has corrected the synchronization is the lawsuit. At that time, processes in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! Nevertheless, it is Chan's fighting style and martial arts choreography that provide humor where this is not possible. After all, it is not the dialogue that makes up a chan movie, but the action and the painful out-takes. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun) and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe in between. They will never make you think, but what an entertaining and well-aligned film. This is probably one of the best martial arts films ever.
