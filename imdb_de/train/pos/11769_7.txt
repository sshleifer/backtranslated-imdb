I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a pretty crappy movie. When I put it in the DVD player, it surprised me very well. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as sheriff. Bill's final scene is very good, good camerawork, nice dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the mafia. Together with his wife he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia gets him on the track and wants the $ 12 million. Bill can only trust the only person he knows from the inside.
