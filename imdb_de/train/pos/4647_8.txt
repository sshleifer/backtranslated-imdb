It takes a very special person to make a film that is so miserable, beguiling, disgusting and repulsive, but in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation. Crispin Glover has truly created something unique in all of his "outside" antics and predispositions. In a highly partisan world, this film seems to be escaping the standard lines of creativity and art, effectively frightening everyone. <br /> <br /> The film takes a far-fetched paradigm (if there is a model at all) and forms it first with Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women who feel like a man with cerebral palsy. It's quite shocking, but if you had the opportunity to attend the Q & A sessions after the screenings, there will clearly be a pouch full of worms that will make you wonder if this is art or just the lowest common denominator. In both cases, you will feel the tremor this film will eventually cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed authors of the world who talk boringly about the human condition. You may not like it, but it's definitely worth a look.
