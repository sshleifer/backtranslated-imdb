I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It contained basic elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and camaraderie. It was not just an ingenious musician who reached the low point, but a man who was lost in grief and tried to find solace in his music. He finds a fellow who comes with their own problems. Claire and Des were able to provide themselves with friendship and love, but above all with a close to the events that had shaped their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is by today's standards an unlikely character of a rock star. Nevertheless, he has musical genius. He also has an event in his past that has brought him to a standstill while things around him are literally in ruins. His focus is on creating his whale music. In fact, it becomes an obsession for him. Claire is the street kid who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while she is in the company. She also finds a mutual friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him for a long time. <br /> <br /> These two love each other. Not the overwhelming, sex-flooded kind of passion, but a love in which friendship and understanding mean more. For two injured people, they trust together.
