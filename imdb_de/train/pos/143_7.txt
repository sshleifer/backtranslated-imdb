Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first. This series does not seem to be quite as serious as the first one. There is much more comedy, but good. <br /> <br /> We are back in the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital when her job is done, but fate wants it different. It quickly hunts ghosts and Helmer drives everyone crazy and it gets worse soon as black forces are unleashed in the kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. Definitely fun, but it lets you take the series a little less seriously. History has retained many elements of the last series and added new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just stupid, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as in the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same, with some additions to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's a strange story and attitude. Some parts are a complete freak show and the characters change during the show. To keep it serious and to keep it real, it is not an easy task. Nevertheless, these actors handle this situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> Many of the good qualities of the first series are preserved. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The hand-held camera, which made Trier world-famous, gives the series tension and reality. It gives the camera the unique ability to move and follow the characters, and Trier uses those skills. Good, movement, great flashes and good composition and editing make watching pleasant. <br /> <br /> Be prepared for a better effect in this sequel than the first one. Be willing to see more, too. I did not like the green thing too much. I thought it was unoriginal and did not fit. Nevertheless, the effects like the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects look good too. The little brother looks pretty weird, but you accept it. Everywhere I would say that the effects are from ok to good. <br /> <br /> The music is pretty good too. Moody and nice. Some of them are really touching. That fits really well. First of all there is little music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a good sequel. If you have seen Riget, you can see this without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before you see this. These two are a series that you do not want to miss.
