I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in 1984 in the US. I've seen him a lot since then. What strikes me about the film is the inclusion of the art of rehearsal in the lives of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the movie, they intertwine, and sometimes you're never sure if you're watching the characters' lives or a scene from a rehearsal. This continues until the climax of the film. All these years later, my friends and I still like to discuss whether "Carmen" will really be stabbed in the end or not. From the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder, it is open to discussion. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances together make up an excellent film that connects the line between life and art.
