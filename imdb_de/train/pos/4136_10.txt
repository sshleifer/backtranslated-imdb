I loved Laurence Olivier very much in the last few weeks and was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I've always found it wonderful when I encounter a movie in which I do not need to have a finger on the remote if nudity raises its ugly head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is sexy last scene until the last moment, and it must have been a real treat for the spectators in 1938. I only wish that people today could accept and love real humor instead of labeling the dreadful junk talks that people today call funny X is worth everyone's time.
