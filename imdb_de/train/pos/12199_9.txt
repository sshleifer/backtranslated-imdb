The first puzzle is to guess what the original movie was from Welles. This makes this adventure a real adventure: to see an incomplete skeleton and use cinematic forensics, imagine the beautiful woman who once supported it. <br /> <br /> If you do, you may see one of the best movies and experience secrets of all time. As the secrets know, the narrative is more ordinary: a simple distraction, a jealous husband as a herring. <br /> <br /> What's wonderful is that Welles places the story in an artificial eye, seeing a dark, dark, multi-faceted world. The first real noir, but even darker. It's not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera. What we can see first-hand is someone who creates a vocabulary that will become commonplace later on. <br /> <br /> Kane has been a success at all the celebration due to the great drama and big story. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would explore the mystery narrative and self-reference of Shakespeare with this eye. Othello and MacBeth are both started at this time, and I consider them part of a single vision. <br /> <br /> The noir feeling depends on the idea that people are not even responsible for their lives - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. To tell this story, Welles has to turn the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> So we have the famous lighting, blockage and angles we know (and have seen countless times since then). And we have the deliberately closed sets: park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and Funhouse. I am sure that what was cut by the barbarians was a lot of "outward" narration that dealt not with the character but with these strange surroundings. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the puzzle is that the Funhouse did introduce it as a suspect among the other character environments. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (which we know from notes and a scene that typed in the union hall was an aspiring novelist) was neither a force of human conspiracy (the park or the civilized version, the courtroom) nor nature out (the picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). Instead, it was a deliberate mood of the gods for amusement. This, of course, is a self-reference to what Welles is doing: driving these people (including themselves) through hell for our own whim, an issue underlined by the Beijing Opera's Welles Doping. And, of course, to the Funhouse, where the environment is directly related to perception. <br /> <br /> More about self-reference: certainly there is a deliberate comment on his relationship with his soon to be ex-wife. But I think there is a strong subconscious commentary to his own mocking of the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Surely Welles was as crazy as his character. And this rape took the form of the murder of this film, leaving behind the decaying corpse mentioned at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> That poor Rita is from China ties the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the rape expected from above, the loss of the woman. The investment in the environment beyond all.
