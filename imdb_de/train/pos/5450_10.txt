Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a small, shitty mining town. He also sells them to men. She flees to New York and literally sleeps upstairs. <br /> <br /> Originally I had only seen the 71-minute version, but it's pretty extreme - for her time. It's pretty tame these days. The movie moves very fast and has a lot of sexual allusions - some of them seem pretty silly today (but funny). It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen - even in 1933. That's not classic or monumental - it's just a quick, fun, dirty little movie that's a lot of fun. It only comes to the end with a small "moral" end that censorship demanded. It seems incredible and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed about it - a guy rightly said "No way"). I've just seen the uncut 75-minute version that has a different, slightly more tragic and MUCH better ending. It was thought that this version was lost until 2004, when it was accidentally discovered! I believe that this is the only one published - but be aware of that. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it AWAY. She makes you believe that she likes to be cruel and slept around. There are also strong fringe benefits from Donald Cook and George Brent. Look for a forerunner John Wayne in a fun piece as a gentle and gentle office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give a 9.
