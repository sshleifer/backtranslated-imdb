This is a feel-good film, about the dreams of a person and the endeavor to realize them. It's a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why do some people have to find fault with every movie that comes out, and above all the good one? Dennis Quaid delivers a solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a high school naturalist and baseball coach urged by his team to once again make a professional baseball career. With an excellent minor cast, including Brian Cox, as the encrusted former naval officer who has gone through so many achievements of his son without his support. It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a movie. If I have a complaint about this movie, this is this: Let Royce Applegate never sign the national anthem again. Seriously, this movie belongs to a handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". It rated two thumbs up and a big "well done".
