What a great movie that is, I do not have words to describe. I do not know how the rating of the film is 7.3. It should be 9.3, but anyway, no one can make this movie, and Akshay's acting is simply a brilliantly good, unexpected ending that makes the movie perfect. You should take a look at this movie, I think twice, it's up to you. Anyway, I love this movie and not only is it sad and funny, it also gives you a really good meaning and what you should do, I think this is one of the best movies in Bollywood history. But I know the people have made other choices, so. The only thing I do not like about this movie is the music. The background music is good, but the songs are not good enough. I think the music would be better if AR Rahman were the music director, but we can not say anything about it so ya.
