Director Sam Fuller has a cult application, especially in Europe. But most of his films are more than forgotten. However, he made a really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". The films made early in his career were significantly inferior. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last frame "pickup" works on all levels. It is filmed with flawless liquid and is characterized by excellent performances. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with outstanding performances, are at their peak. Widmark, who was no stranger to dealing with bad guys, succeeds in literally playing villains, only the slightest humanity that captivates his character and makes Jean Peter's character all the more credible Fuller does not hold in this really hard movie punches. There is a scene where Jean Peters is being wiped out by Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many Noir films of the time, this remains an excellent example of the genre.
