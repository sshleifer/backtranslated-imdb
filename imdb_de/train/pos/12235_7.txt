"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastically rough, trashy and energetic Z-quality production that every self-confident camp horror freak simply needs to see for himself! The ideal way to describe this inexpensive 70s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times dirtier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic space mission, but turns out to be the carrier of a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! After seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve shocks the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and falling back from body parts. Doctor Ted Nelson urgently needs to find him as the disease also causes an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound silly, but this movie is hugely entertaining and contains great makeup effects by Rick Baker. The face of the melting guy looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big plus is that William Sachs's script does not waste time on boring scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsion starts immediately and lasts until the last moment of the movie. Just enjoy this silly horror gemstone and try to turn off your brain activity as much as possible, because if you think about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss all the fun of camping!
