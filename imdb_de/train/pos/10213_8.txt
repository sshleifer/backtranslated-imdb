This whimsical movie had the misfortune to be released at the same time by the very popular "Amelie", both playing the wonderful Audrey Tautou, who played the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, has made one of the most beautiful films that have come from France lately. <br /> <br /> The film deals with chance, as its English title shows. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can create chaos over the Atlantic during the flight, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific. This is unbelievable considering only these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director inserts all the characters you see in the film, and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but seems to work well in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> An accidental meeting in the metro sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to say her zodiac sign and reads from her newspaper. Irene, it seems like she's about to cross and find her soul mate the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman says he has the same date of birth as Irene. It looks as if they are meant to be together from the beginning, but unfortunately they will not connect until the last frame of the movie. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, has little to do until the end, but he shows he is present and plays his part well. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode, as he seems to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way people are connected.
