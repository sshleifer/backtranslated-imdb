I did not see this movie! At least not in its entirety. I've seen some haunting clips that made me see everything. A sequence remains in my memory until today. A (very convincing-looking) spacecraft orbits the dark side of the moon. The pilot triggers a flash to photograph the hidden surface beneath him. The moon flashes in visibility. , , , and for a few seconds it is there. Parallel lines, squares. Could it be ... then the light fades and the glimpse of ... what ... is gone and it's time for the spaceship to return to Earth. Wonderful I have also seen some other clips, but I would love to get the whole movie.
