I am glad that this is now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style over flashing headlights with empty heads and constant loud noises. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short attention span or the joke and fantasy do not make friends literary narrative you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has successfully translated the story of Catherine Storr's novel 'Marianne Dreams' into a screenplay. An unenviable task, as anyone who has seen a movie about a book undoubtedly knows this. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, so director Bernard Rose can use the actors in a way that is rarely seen today. they treat themselves to the craft of acting! I know, I know, actors doing their job and acting instead of having to raid the camera lens while a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions, and fierce battles erupt around them are a rare treat, but that actually happens to be film , <br /> <br /> This brings me to the ultimate reason that this is a movie for the fanciful thinker and not for the bloody tabloid reader. Apart from a solid script, directing and acting, he relies on the atmosphere. Tension and implied horror. If it's supposed to be a horror story, Paper House's presentation is more like Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you like lots of loud noises, explosions and constant cuts and bright, flashing colors you should look 'Transformers' better, but if you like an exciting story, stand out for a skillful and impressive use unfolded by narrative, without violating your intelligence by force feeding your cacophonic nonsense, then this could only be your thing.
