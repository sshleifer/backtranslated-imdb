I enjoyed the innocence of this movie and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla just looks stunning and the eyes are particularly lifelike. Sometimes it is even a bit scary and should make children easily anxious without surpassing them. Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine. Usually these Hollywood movies played in the past have the need to create a straw man villain, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet we can not really treat them like humans because they are not. Not many films venture into this area and it is worth seeing if you want to consider the similarity of humans and animals.
