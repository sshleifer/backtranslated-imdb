I've only seen the first series on DVD, but would summarize the sopranos as a Shakespeare plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino and almost as good as The Godfather (hence no "10") and far better than any effort by Guy Ritchie. Although there is plenty of action, some pretty bloody, the story is shaped by characters. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great storylines. e.g. the relationship of the priest (or the absence of it) with Carmilla and the wife of the restaurateur and Christopher and his fool friend (who did not last long (a Darwin Award candidate?) the script and the acting, the other reasons I liked it < br /> <br /> 1. I really wanted to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomato sauce 2. the music 3. It shows that literally everyone can suffer from mental health problems.
