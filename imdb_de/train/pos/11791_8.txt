This is a very interesting short film by David Lynch. To say the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short form. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has cried, the brunette is talking threatening with the blonde, and that's it. <br /> <br /> With many quiet moments, but with the haunting music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of tension. This short film feels a bit like "Mulholland Dr." a film that I loved a lot, and that's why I liked that movie. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you'll like that.
