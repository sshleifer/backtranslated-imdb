Kiera Nightly switched directly from the P & P set to this action film ... She could hardly have opted for a more dramatic image. A great success in Love Actually and as a Lizie in Jane Austen's classic she is once again "on the go". Just as her bikini-clad, more warlike wife in King Arthur was skinier than muscle, it's hard to imagine that delicate frame resists a bounty hunter's life ... But that's exactly what Domino Harvey (the real) and I (one of the biggest Fans of Nightly) believe that she joins in. <br /> <br /> stuff ... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the postcode of Beverly Hills in LA, where all movie stars live. The most famous film of the Domino Harvey father was the Manchurian candidate (who appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of an overdose of drugs in her bathroom before the film was released in June 2005 after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just completed negotiations to include some of her music in the film. * Kiera Knightly in her interview with Lucy Liu alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie a bit far-fetched, take a look at Domino Harvey, as the facts are more amazing than fiction.
