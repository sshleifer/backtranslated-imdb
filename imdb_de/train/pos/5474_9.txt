On July 10, 2005, the National Gallery of Art showed the long-considered, lost original version of this film. It restores important scenes cut by censors when they were released. The figure of the cobbler, a morally good individual in the original censored 1933 publication, is depicted here as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze, and calls on her to use men to take the lead. The crazy end of the original, which I assume is in current VHS versions, is eliminated and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and strength. Hopefully there will be a remake of this movie on DVD for everyone to appreciate its great qualities. Search for it.
