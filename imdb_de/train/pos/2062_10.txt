First of all, I'm the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit over the top. A weakened, perhaps less acrobatic scarecrow would have made this movie less cheesy. But overall, I think it's one of the better B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the important nude factor, there are several other films in which he can see them. But here she gets all the evil, especially towards the end, when she moves away from the intertwined scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a great job as a sheriff and a drunken friend. Yes, it's a low budget B movie. But of all I've seen, this is definitely one of my top favorites.
