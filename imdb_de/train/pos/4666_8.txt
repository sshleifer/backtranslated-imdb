It is very smart for all 60s to see the movie. The humor is pretty gentle, but it has grown more than expected. The cast is first class and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the movie and mumbles some pretty funny things, and that's all very trivial; I buy the movie as soon as it appears on DVD. The plot is that Ustinov was dismissed as an embezzler from prison and repressed as a computer geek from an American company with a London office. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and seeing her fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual dead man, and Karl Malden has fun as a fat and sloppy manager running the London office. The ending is funny and beautifully cynical.
