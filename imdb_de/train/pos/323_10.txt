This is really an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (in both form and content) that no fan of French New Wave or underground movies should miss. There are hardly any opening or closing credits - we simply fell into the world of consumerist art, the revolution and the youth. This film has little to do with documentary film and is more interesting when we play with our advertising ideas and their relationship to reality. There are lines between real and not real that are familiar with films that discuss documentaries, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing reasons, not for the description of the real.
