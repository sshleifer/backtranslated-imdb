I'm so shocked that this show was canceled. I just recently started seeing her, and I love her. Her show that could go as far as Friends. She had the humor and was extremely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> These are two brothers and two sisters who live under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the oldest sibling and takes on the paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should take over a year as it was fantastic. Great show with the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
