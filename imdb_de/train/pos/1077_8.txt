This is a comedy like it used to be, and compared to the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET ?, it shows all the more how filmmakers of the '40s had a flair for comedy unfortunately lost since then. <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I saw it for the first time, and even at this tender age, there was a lot to laugh about. Well, of course, since I'm familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see a lot that I've missed as a teenager. The three main characters ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... worked together perfectly, but the core of the film lies in the frustrations a dream can achieve. It is never as easy and free of invisible complications as you would imagine. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy that is still over trying to recreate it.
