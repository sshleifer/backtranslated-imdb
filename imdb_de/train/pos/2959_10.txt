It was Saturday night and there was a movie on TV titled BASEketball. I always wanted to see it, but never came to it when it was in the cinema. Boy, I was wrong. Words can not describe how funny this movie is with the creators of South Park, who show a natural chemistry on screen when they're funny. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after I first saw her, I saw her 7 times !! I am obsessed with it, and I know that anyone who appreciates the work of Trey and Matts will appreciate this film. A MUST SEE, THIS IS MY COMEDY OF ALL TIME
