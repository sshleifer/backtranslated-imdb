"Ko tamo peva" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A tragicomedy with very profound implications for the fate of humanity, presented through the eyes of seemingly simple and simple people from a godforsaken Serbian province shortly before the start of World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia, where the movie had a very limited distribution, and I have not had a chance to hit it since then. It is a pity that this excellent movie is almost forgotten now. I have often searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it and unfortunately found none. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of filmmaking for suggesting how to buy a copy.
