This show is damn funny! The jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yeah, I know what they're saying, it's not funny anymore after Season 8 because Eric and Kelso are not on the show anymore and Randy is a real idiot. Randy is compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not take the funniest characters and switch them to "I'm a cool guy" guy (Randy). It's not his fault anyway, but the authors are trying to keep the eighth season fun. It's still like that, not as much as it was in previous seasons, but it's fine. The 360's are awesome circle, Red is a real kind of mental abuse dad :) and Kitty is always half a pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he also has his moments. The least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. They are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Dumbass!
