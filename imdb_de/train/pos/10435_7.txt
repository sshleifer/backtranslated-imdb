My watch came a little too late, but I'm glad I saw both this and the sequel together. Therefore, I would like to compliment the creators of this film for treating the idea of ​​romance in such a pure and fundamental way ... and very little different from the idea of ​​relationships! Since much has already been written about the film, it would be only appropriate to highlight some sections of the film that I personally loved very much. <br /> <br /> I think, the point where Jesse and Celine make their fake phone calls The friends were a very smart way to tell each other what they meant each other on a journey that did not even last 24 hours ... The curiosity of two people, both of whom believe that the other had an infallible influence on the other, was treated very wisely ... <br /> <br /> It's not easy on the plot, to realize a romantic story based on pure conversation. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic films With this taste, the characters themselves are not clearly defined in the mind of the writer and the director. What the actors produce is what becomes of them. Right or wrong. Even the idea bearer would find it hard to justify ... to become the character, the actor's life must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors do the RIGHT job! Kudos .. !!! and before sunset is another feather that makes it even more beautiful!
