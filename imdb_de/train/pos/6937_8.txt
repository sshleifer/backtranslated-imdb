This rousing west reflects the history of the famous rifle of the early West that was sought after by all. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the coveted Winchester in a shootout just to lose it in a robbery. The story describes Stewart's search for the rifle and a particular man through the movie. The rifle keeps changing hands, as if the owner were willing to use force. The picture has a lot of action and excitement as Stewart gets closer to his quarry. A great cast here is supporting Stewart, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems out of place here and the purpose of her role is rather dark. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, adolescent heartbreakers in later years, have short but good roles.
