Starlift is a pleasant and interesting retrospective of all the musical star images that each studio released in the years of World War II. If you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, etc. in the film and with people like the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn delivering the music It's an easy movie to shoot , And the conspiracy is not in the way. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is the two Air Force men Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy who try to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using the fact that they both came from Youngstown Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was the rules dentist and half of the city. The scheme works too well, as Louella Parsons soon lists it as an element in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She liked the fact that Warner Brothers or Jack Warner had done more for her than the other studio bosses because she had also used this studio to release her radio program at the Hollywood Hotel. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot She also touched on the real-life efforts of Ruth Roman, who played herself to bring her studio and others for shows at the Air Force bases for the Korean-traveling military and women , Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and appear on a show at Travis Air Force Base, where much of this movie was filmed. A special number was filmed for the talents of Phil Harris, who sing / tell a ballad. Look at the stranger, I am a Texas Ranger, supported and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he had a great time spoiling his image. This is the oldest clich√© to say that you do not do it that way anymore, but really not because you do not have a studio that has all this talent under contract. That's one thing about the end of the old studio system we can mourn.
