Midnight Cowboy is like a master class in acting / directing / cinematography / proofreading / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally published and I saw it for the first time only a few years ago, but it has been absolutely successful and I have watched it several times since then. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the moving performances of Voight and Hoffman (though I know this movie well, I'm still upset when Voight flashes one of his innocently aching glances, or Hoffman coughs up his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly cut dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to make films that are as visually and acoustically as interesting This Midnight Cowboy should be viewed at all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
