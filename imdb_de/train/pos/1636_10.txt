This is one of the best movies of the 80s !!! It sticks out like a "shit in a punch bowl" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine denounced it or whatever. And yet they proudly gave their name in a show with "Stuart", "I speak-not-enlish Chinese Lady" and "UPS guy on speed". What about it? And I love Ron Leibman-he's foxy !! I wonder why his name was removed from the credits. It was his funniest role I know. Of course he is not nearly as foxy as in Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this film is at the top of National Lampoon's Vacation. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any of the teenage-themed movies of the 80's, you'll love this movie! Rent it and you will see what I mean !!
