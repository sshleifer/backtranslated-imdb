A well-crafted and imaginative production, refreshingly devoid of clich√©s, this somewhat picaresque affair tells of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions: the man is a kidnapped convict who has kidnapped the youth for him Value as a hostage. Alan Gibson, with a keen sense of well-balanced narrative, expertly manages to bring freshness to almost every scene, as the criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris) believes that his refusal to parole is particularly undeserved the foreground, as he flees to the residence of his childhood at the lake. The moody Steckert, who often breaks into a song or dances a few steps, gradually gains the confidence and affection of his captive. When the police approach an inevitable showdown, the tethered couple are considered to be very similar in their reactions to forms of rejection, as stated by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) who is supposed to assist an eager police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is looking for the man Steckert and his "prisoner" is responsible. This is an enthralling story worth telling, a quick and novel adventure benefiting from a capital benefit from Harris, fine twists of Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as a kidnapped lad, with a proper one bizarre score contributed by Wilfred Josephs and first-class cinematography by Frank Watts, with all the material filmed in a beautiful autumnal province of Ontario.
