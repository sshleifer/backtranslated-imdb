As an anti-football player I (beyond the surface) reluctantly took my younger brother along to see this movie, though hopefully I hoped it might be East, East II. The trailers looked funny, so I thought so I would try. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was stuck to the screen, and it had nothing to do with the neck bump caused by too tight sitting due to a crowded auditorium. The acting was fresh and lively, the characters captivating and the jokes truly funny. The entire auditorium laughed every minute or so. Football fan or no football fan, the sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a pinch of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, I dare not say ... better than East Is East. <br /> <br /> This movie trots beautifully in a nice step, never to stay for a little longer than necessary or to leave something unfinished, to entertain the audience and mentally busy. Although it is not a characteristic twist and turn film, there are some pleasant surprises along the way and things do not always happen as you would expect. <br /> <br /> If you say there are elements of predictability, but they were satirically more exploited than as a script filler. I think, depending on your particular preference for happy endings, you might end up either thrilled or disappointed. If it had come to a different conclusion, I would have written a strong letter to the scriptwriters. <br /> <br /> For the actors, I have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) did the best. I never knew there were such people, but their realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me they might! Unfortunately, the prize for the most convincing (the main characters) goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, even if she has done a great job. It's just that someone is the last of the best and I'm sorry Kiera, this time it's you. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not go before the credits. When the light came up, I realized to my horror that maybe I should not have seen this movie. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugar sweet blue juice. Oh, what can I say, it was absolutely awesome and I can not recommend it enough. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am student. I only splash when it's really worth it.
