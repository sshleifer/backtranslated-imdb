There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this movie is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic requirement of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered part of Burgundy, not Great Britain. We then track the lives of the residents in their struggle to preserve the treasure found after the bomb blast and keep out black marketeers who soon find that there is no rationing if they are exempt from British law. If they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, they see how they defend themselves against the system. <br /> <br /> You are forced to ration water and food in your stall for the right thing. In fact, things get worse than they were before it all began, before it all started, then morality comes into play. If they lose all the food, they think they are beaten and ask for surrender just to make London respond to their plight by sending food, much of it. This allows them to continue their fight. <br /> <br /> This film is consistently the right touch, acting is outstanding, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It's just right, not too sentimental, and the moral of the story has not pushed you down the throat. Worth a visit
