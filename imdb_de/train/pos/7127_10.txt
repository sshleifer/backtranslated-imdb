Wonderful film that deals again with the trials and tribulations of the 11th World War in England. What makes this movie so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British classics as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As in this movie, we see the desperation of people in times of war. <br /> <br /> The performances are particularly noteworthy, especially by the embittered John Thaw, who is assigned a child evacuated from the bombing in London. <br /> <br /> We soon realize why this child wets his bed. He comes from a crazy mother who has terribly abused him. The old man takes the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks only to find a tragedy. He literally abducts the boy and can convince a higher child that the child is better off than in a boy's house. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it aims at lovable relationships.
