I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad. actually it was pretty good. This movie contained some of the funniest writings I've ever seen in a movie. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies ever, but I've laughed a lot in some places. "The police decided my father's death was a suicide, saying he fell in the elevator shaft, on some bullets." Well, this movie is not for everyone, its mostly silly humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; If you hated those movies, I would probably recommend you to steer clear. All in all, it was an entertaining film about a group of superhero wannabees who became real heroes in the end. It's an overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen yet, because, as I'd seen before, it was absolutely garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understood why this film was able to put together such a superstar cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even the child of Good Burger. The reason for this is that Mystery Man 7 out of 10 is full of excellent comedic lyrics. A very big surprise.
