The idea is a very smart title. The movie feels serious. But it is so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these people doing a full-blown comedy or is there something else? The little dialogue that the movie has is not very sensitive and this increases the power of the movie. If the entire sound was turned off by the movie, he would not actually lose the movie. The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it alone carries the entire story. I am a blessing and with the blessing the emotion follows a shame. First, I'll be filming this as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed by the work. But then I wondered what next? Where can someone see this work? The usual connection of art without purpose is not to be found here. You can see the intention in the design from beginning to end. The use of African music, the style of casting, seems to be all planned for a reason. The character development is amazing. I think the casting is the strongest aspect of the movie. The characters are easy to define within 2 minutes of the actual 6 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these films, there really needs to be more support for the development of short films throughout the region.
