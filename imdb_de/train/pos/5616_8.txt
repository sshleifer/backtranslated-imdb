What you can really say ... "The Tenant" is a first-class thriller, which is equipped with equal excitement and full-blown paranoia. It is a lavishly plotted film - every detail seems to be contained for a reason - even if the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never objectively addressed. Hence, the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) remains, a meek Pole who has been given a home due to the suicide of the previous tenant, to lead us through a world of escalation of fear and insecurity. After an apartment warming party hosted by a group of obnoxious colleagues, Trelkovsky finds himself under a growing, seemingly inexplicable, test by the roommates in his building. The rest of the film documents his mental decline and gives us a thorough mindset that equals the later efforts of David Lynch. However, "The Tenant" is more brutal and sinister, with unexpected comic relief, good performances, and a truly immersive score. It's a movie that's better experienced than described.
