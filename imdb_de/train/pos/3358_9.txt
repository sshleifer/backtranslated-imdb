First of all, I have only one word for this movie: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best films that have touched me, from the story to the performances so beautifully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with this last one because it really gave the character depth, as it was a very hard role. Nevertheless, the two formed a couple that surprised me from start to finish, showing a friendship full of love that develops throughout the day and is captured in the movie. The story takes some time to roll, as the introduction of the characters is long, but eventually we are compensated with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have the chance, you can see it, because it's a movie that will be remembered for a long time. Just unbelievable - 9/10.
