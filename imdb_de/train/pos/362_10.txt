In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg wrote an emotionally powerful and memorable story of a young African American, Celie (debut for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life is filled with hardships. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. A widower looks at Nettie, but her father gives him Celie. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men, and as African-Americans their rights are less than a zero. Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and underrated film by Spielberg. He should do more drama, with "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" being a good idea. <br /> <br /> The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a wild comedian, but the introductory role as Celie is a notable word that can really draw her from heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "Mister". I've never seen him in such a bad role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as Sofia with strong will. <br /> <br /> Attention! Prepare to take a set of towels with you when watching this movie. You can really connect with the history of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with your siblings as I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Mr. Applause applauds Mr. Spielberg!
