From the outstanding acting of a very impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) screenplay, to the elaborate cinematography, to the wonderful music score by Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in the film experience that is almost impossible to find in any one Area an error. <br /> <br /> Several comparisons were made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all due thanks to Mel Gibson, Braveheart was too much of a confident and preaching epic to Rob Roy to me, as the kind of movie I would see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy simply grabs you and takes you into the most elaborate storytelling. Not a single scene is wasted. <br/> <br/> Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic suspense, action and occasionally humor. The characters are well crafted and perfectly convey locals and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic historical setting. <br /> <br /> Moreover, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we all too often observe in modern films. <br/> <br /> For example, while we hope that the hero, Rob Roy, prevails wins, we realize that his abuses are products of his own pride and honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful baddies in the history of cinema. Yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have made him what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes his story more believable and compelling. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure that has one of the largest sword chords ever charted and a climatic end worthy of everyone's eager anticipation.
