This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it's definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbery that shows Austen at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more connected to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I found the characters selected to represent the roles well selected. Kate Beckinsale paints the line between girlyness and social snob with a grace that has been completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow's '96 version. Samantha Morton's wispy blonde locks suit her posture and character as the simper accompanying her role in previous characterizations is replaced by the Harriet we know from the book. Mr. Knightly's role is very well executed in my opinion; In this much neglected, voluptuous film are here both the seriousness and the gentle compassion with which the hero is painted in the novel, present.
