What a delightful playground? A very competent film that has so much charm and feel-good factor that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein is brilliantly played by Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable. Better than I saw them in these movies opposite Tom Hanks? As a young mathematician trying to be recognized. You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and immediately feel for her, and as a young man it's easy to understand what it's got to go through Ed's mind (Tim Robbins) to pursue his true love. There is universal attraction in these emotions, even if I.Q. It keeps everything easy, is fun and is beautifully tied up. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not difficult, but if you look, there are a few subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, though he was a great spiritualist. his phrases like something like "If it's not impossible, then why?" I believe he believes in achieving higher goals that go beyond the immediate area. In this film, the question arises, what is an accident really? For example, if Albert and his crazy cronies nudge Katharina off her stiff upper lip, the unloving James (Stephen Fry, who gives life to this otherwise cardboard-tempered character and you can not help but feel his lack of feeling) counts. , How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see and appear to be coincidental? <br /> <br /> And of course we would like to think in real life, despite what we often observe from the people we watch. We know that we get the catherines to Edwards and James has to learn the ice water in their veins thaw. How nice to know that it could work in the innocent (and disturbing, all-Caucasian) land of innocence in the Ironhower era of I.Q.
