Extremely interesting and fascinating movie. The similarities with David Lynch (who is even literally quoted in the film as red curtains) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the janitor in this movie is called Mrs. Grubach, as well as the trial in The Process ...) are clearly present in this one However, this case contains clear indications of the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film I can not clearly describe: This colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but also the personal memories of the main character are a central theme and his pursuit of social life contact and love. These are the symbolic themes that I have derived from the film, but in reality they are nothing more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover an extremely intriguing film with magnificent imagery (beautiful close-ups of Beatles, larvae and other evil insects alternate with it great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere gives the film additional style). Maybe I can say that I did not quite "understand" the movie, but I watched hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the mesmerizing mystery.
