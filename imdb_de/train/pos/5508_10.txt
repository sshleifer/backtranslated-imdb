It's the year 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, a Cuban citizen for five years, disappears from the earth and leaves a sombre Fidel Castro to announce he's probably dead. Cuba moves to Bolivia to live on an assumed identity. Guevara, who lives in La Paz, has the idea to overthrow the corrupt, bourgeois government there. Steven Soderberg picks up where "Che: Part One" stops (this time only better). The pace is more on the finish, the work of the drama is very good (including a turn of Benecio Del Toro as Che Guevara). Suffice to say, it's probably best if you watch both films to hear the true story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I've had the rare opportunity to watch both films at a show, for example, a long journey !). As with "Che-Part 1: The Argentina," this film has no MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language and violence to easily catch it as "R".
