Gere and Danes play two workers from the Public Security Department, who are following the sex offenders released. Gere, who plays Babbage, calls her his flock. Gere is an over-obsessed revenge on the way out. He trains Newcomer Allison to take over his job. Gere sees his herd as very sick, disturbed puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to behave like the police and to solve crimes. He is constantly warned against this behavior, which is why he is replaced. During his last few days, a young girl is missing, and Babbage is sure that it is one of his herds that has gone astray. He and Allison enter a list and find that some of the perpetrators have gone AWOL. So he decides that he has to find the missing girl instead of helping the police. This part is a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br /> This film shows sick, twisted stuff. For example, when Babbage and Allison walk into this building, where a few sick people disturb each other. There are also the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see which sick freaks they are. However, I would not call this movie an exaggeration because not much is shown in the movie.
