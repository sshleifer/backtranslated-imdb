I'm not a big fan of martial arts films, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4, and I got it for free when I rented the other films. I absolutely loved it, my roommate and I (the 22-year-old students of biochemistry and accounting) spent the half hour after the movie with the weird kung-fu sounds and tossing each other coasters. I can not explain it (well, maybe a bit of tequila). I've never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a skinny guy kicking a big guy, beating him, kicking a bigger guy, etc. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
