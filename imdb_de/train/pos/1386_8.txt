Three teenagers in an incomplete love triangle. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the apex is Marie, a serious, slender and slim tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: Coquette, chubby - I dare say fat - and desire the first kiss with a boy, but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of their stupidity, boys do not seem to be interested and it hurts them. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the crown is a beautiful "fille fatal" blond vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming at competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie submits to the vampire life and tries to be an argument as a synchronized swimmer. The vamp has the reputation of being a whore. Marie is not wiped out by this call. Put the good reputation in the foreground. <br /> <br /> The first half is prepared. We see a lot of synchronous swimming as we familiarize ourselves with the three girls. Finally, the narrative leaves swimming in synchrony and focuses on the wrong relations between the three. That's when unexpected things happen. <br /> <br /> It's a hallmark of French films to throw nuggets of wisdom at the viewer. This is no exception. This is about blankets and dying. In the movie you will learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says using synchronized swimming makes sense. That only women are sports is a metaphor for the life of a girl: pretty and feminine on the surface while working hard and being competitive. A series of scenes drive this point: elegant movements and a smile for the public, legs clumsily under water. The title in French is also suggestive: "Prieuve" or octopus suggests that a person must juggle with loads at the same time.
