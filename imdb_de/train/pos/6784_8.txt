I like it when my Ronald Colman is frantic and daunting, the man you see in films like If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A brooding Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life, precisely because his role as actor Anthony John is so unusual for him, Colman was bestowed with Best Picture Actor Oscar in 1947, becoming his most famous part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes the method very seriously. He has just completed a successful run in a comedy of manners and he is a pretty cheerful guy. For a change, after the play has finished its Broadway run, Colman brings a resurgence of Othello to New York. As opposed to the opposite, you can get. <br /> <br /> His lead actress in both is his former wife Signe Hasso, who loves him very much, but can not stand his mood swings at work. Colman loves her too and loves her back. However, he sets off for a nervous breakdown when he begins to confuse himself with the jealous bog Othello and Hasso with their role as Desdemona. Unfortunately, Shelley Winters stands in the way as a poor waitress, taken up by his madness by a depressive Colman, and she ends up like poor Desdemona in a play. Killed in the same way and now it's a matter for the murder department Joe Sawyer. Colman's performance is so good that one wonders if this represents a career risk for actors? I'd shudder to think that if there were unresolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, they would work Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never quite buy the story for that reason, but I applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the role. I'm sure there was a bit of regret when he won the Oscar because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others this year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Electra. Colman receives support from the other cast members, including Edmond O '. Brien, who is in Colman's jealous fantasy in the unwanted part of Cassio. In A Double Life, there is no Iago equivalent, none that incites jealousy, it's all in his head. <br /> <br /> And one of the most sophisticated and civilized minds of the last century.
