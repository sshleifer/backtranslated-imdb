Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> The best Star Wars ever. It's the first movie Sean won the bad guys, and it's a very good ending. I really had to wait for the next Star Wars, because in this movie something comes together that you have to learn more in the last one. With many films I always get the feeling that it could not be better, but not with this one. and I'll never forget that Wader's part was Luke, that he's his father. I also love the bob figure who has a backplayer. If you've never seen a Star Wars movie, go to it. The best. <br /> <br /> Thank you Lucas
