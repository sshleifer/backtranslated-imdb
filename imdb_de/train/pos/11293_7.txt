William Wyler was said to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hard's successful Broadway play on music / recruiting poster Vivant, but his own military commitments intervened, leading to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "women's director" has a secure relationship to the many documentary sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more uninhibited humanity than is generally allowed, especially in times of war. Sure, the Gee-Whiz (and totally white, aside from an unclaimed Chinese-American recruits) is a bunch of newbies who are nicer and healthier than in real life, and talking about home and mother and wife and kid gets pretty fat is efficient propaganda and undeniably touching. Remarkable also for the purely military men, some of whom did not reappear for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (as Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very early look at Judy Holliday, who appears in the picture only after an hour and a half, but has some good little sequences as O'Brien's worried Brooklyn husband. Too bad that his rights are in a tangle and the only pressure that everyone knows is 16mm; Obviously, after the release of Twentieth Century Fox, the rights have been transferred to the Army (with considerable success), and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it's probably somewhere inside the Pentagon. It is insincere and fickle in places, but it also keeps alive the rigors of military training and the horrors of war and deserves to be seen on a larger scale.
