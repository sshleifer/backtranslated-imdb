Who does not want to go on an excursion with Peter Falk? The right eye of this guy today has more character than most actors. This is the kind of funny and touching film we all seek to counterbalance all those bombastic special effects holes. Women will love it when it comes to men's wake-up romance tips, and men will love it because they study the father-son character - a great little scene after another. And it has just enough edge to be a real indie find. Obviously, this is a love job for Paul Reiser, who understands what it is like to be both father and son, as well as to have laughter and tears as you move through life. But the funniest thing was when Reiser saw Falk. It could be said that it was both his character, which came to a new appreciation of his father, as well as a fellow actor who really appreciated Peter Falk's special craft. Really adorable. Let's hope that this movie will be released soon so everyone can laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and his people.
