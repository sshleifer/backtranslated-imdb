This early anime movie was a pretty good movie that I once filmed on the sci-fi channel when anime was really popular here in America and not the valuation weakness that adults swim, claiming it was in the cartoon Network. Frankly, I believe it has less to do with the fact that it's less popular and people now prefer to shop when buying DVDs to watch the episodes on the internet uncut. Although this film probably did not have too many cuts and the language work was fine for a dubbed movie, although I prefer to watch the Japanese original version. Americans tend to use rather annoying voices for children in something dubbed. This movie shows a boy getting on a train called Galaxy Express in the hope that he can make it into a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by a robot who hunts people for fun. In the course of his adventures, he befriends the various workers on the train as well as a woman who resembles his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel who, like most women in anime films, has a secret that could either be really good for ours young hero or really bad. He also travels from planet to planet as the train makes various stops, and he meets a space pirate named Captain Harlock, who appears to have starred in his own animated series. The Galaxy Express thus takes place in this universe. All in all a very good trip with a strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this, but it was not quite as good as this, but the end was a bit more final than here.
