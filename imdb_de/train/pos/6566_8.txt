Have you ever wondered where the ideas for romance and other paper come from? According to 'Jake Speed', they are based on real people and live the adventures they write about and publish. This movie is about quality family entertainment, moderate use of force and worst clothes. The language is not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. This is an 'Austin Powers' look at 'Indian Jones', without the exaggerated antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for children in the range of 10 to 15 years.
