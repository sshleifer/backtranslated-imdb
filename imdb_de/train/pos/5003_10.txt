I would not see this show. But I am glad that I did it. The critics just do not understand that! It's one of the funniest and most entertaining things on TV right now. Although the interviews were conducted with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but put it in the mouth of animals and insects, and it's a laugh-uprising. I laughed so much, I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the babies and their mother is priceless. The husband and wife talked about health problems, and the male bird, who made a crap after the woman, said she was completely clogged, broke me completely! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've ever seen! Hopefully it will come back next summer when this run is over.
