The best part of An American In Paris is the long ballet sequence in which Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters. Kelly had previously been established as a street artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical end of a musical life bursting with life and energy, Gershwin tunes and cast members such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was in great shape here - it's a bit different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the entire movie, as crowned with the ballet, gives it a distinct wow effect. No wonder the sequence ended with 'That's Entertainment' after all the other MGM music highlights were over.
