I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show soon became eerie / exciting to stupid. ABC is to blame. They moved the show to Friday night at 20:00, then known as "family class". It should never have been on Friday. I was in high school for my second year and loved the early episodes! It was the first time against Police Woman in NBC. ABC had big problems with Friday evenings. Overall, a bad season for them until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuted in January '75. Kolchak should have been a hit. Darren McGavin asked to finish his contract to finish the show. Too bad that Richard Matheson's had not written in the original TV movies. Nevertheless, McGavin made Kolchak his own, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to my mind. This INS, with the manual typewriters and clattering teletypes, is now rustic and ancient, but that was part of the appeal. They were lucky that Simon Oakland played "Vincenzo" out of the TV movies.
