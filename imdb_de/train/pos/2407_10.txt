The first time I saw this movie, I was thrilled. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (Bible believe). I do not go with the crowd of legal believers. I got out of this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In their attempts to take over our government, they are doing what Judas has tried. I call it the Judas syndrome. Judas did not understand, though Jesus said that his kingdom is not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed something of it. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his students. <br /> <br /> He too was a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a movie where you can see everything. <br /> <br /> Very satisfactory.
