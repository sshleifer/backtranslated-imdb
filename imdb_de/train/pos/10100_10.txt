I came across this topic through pure, dumb luck (Act-I) and that was more than a decade ago. This was not what the cover label on the band mentioned. It surprised me. It intimidated me. It shocked me. At some point I forgot something and almost a decade later, I thought about it again. Then both went and bought both acts. They were even better than I had experienced in the beginning. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that although the tank police are constantly at war with crime, tanks and heavy artillery, they are having a hard time with criminals. This is either never shown or just a lie, as it seems that it takes most of the time. If this piece of the state of war was indeed propaganda, it certainly was not shown as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think the Japanese original version could have been as good as the Americanization version of it. But in terms of history, some correct explanations have certainly been lost in the translation, but it can be excused.
