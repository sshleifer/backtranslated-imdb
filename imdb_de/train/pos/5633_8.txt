Farrah Fawcett is great in this powerful 1986 drama in which she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a possible rapist. Well done for Farrah because she is a Golden Globe nominee for the "Best Actress". <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (James Russo is playing nasty) comes to her home, sharing it with her two roommates (who are comfortable!), Marjorie has to play with Joe's frightening demands , There are some disturbing and shocking pictures! <br /> <br /> When their roommates come home, they are (to say the least) of Marjorie's actions and a great achievement by Alfre Woodard, who is desperately trying to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into a police force , makes the movie even more snappy. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid rather irritating, but when Joe finally admits he came there to kill them all, the movie is indeed a very emotional piece of drama. <br /> <br /> All in all, Extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well-made movie, and I've seen it hundreds of times! Well done to all involved.
