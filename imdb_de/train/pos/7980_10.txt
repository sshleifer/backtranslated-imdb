Man On Fire tells the story of a former soldier on a drinking problem who accepts a job as the personal bodyguard of a small girl in Mexico during the kidnapping ransom ransom. At first he is not too friendly, but then she befriends him, he decides to give up drinking, and so on ... then one day she will be kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> And He does not stop to take revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story of Man On Fire, but at least expect some big twists, including the end, which is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the great music that Harry-Gregson Williams composed with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... the thing is, here everything is perfect. First show. Denzel Washington is in good shape, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are as good as ever, the great Radtha Mitchell and the amazing young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the cinematography, which is stunning and has won an Oscar together with excellent editing. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. History is intelligent, history makes you think ... and is just beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you need to see at least once in your life!
