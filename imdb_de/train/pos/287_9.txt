We loved the movie. I am the mother of two little men. I love to watch a movie with them where men have integrity and character. Movement is where money is not the most important thing. And family is forever and love is more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we could see more of the Davis family. But in everything I loved, I had the same feeling that the others "please do not be over". We both wish that actors would not change. The new actors were a good substitute. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son loved this movie. asked me to buy them all. He is a movie critic. If he says that tells me something. The family should all see that this move buys him for friends. Help to bring back a time of values. We will read the books now because we are addicted. really hope to see more. Be blessed move happily
