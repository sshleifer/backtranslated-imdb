Paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and very fulfilling. I went to this film and expected a typical "family movie", one that would find me in a few moments unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mind-frame changed immediately as the beauty of the movie quickly intrigued me. It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be "healthy" coined. Most are cheaply made, written and produced to attract only young family members, who then pull the unfortunate elders into a mental illness that covers over 65 minutes of overused visual gags and conspiracies. Oh yes, Paulie had an action. It told the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie, the parrot, who spoke incredibly and often talked to her. Marie's dorky idiot father found this unbelievable and thought that Paulie was harmful to the mental health of his four-year-old daughter and quickly tore her apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and failures) as he tries to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters. Oh yes, Paulie could really (smart) talk and had a brisk New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot was always tight and entertaining and attracted me. Paulie is the best family movie I've found and loved with all my heart. Ever. Serious. Get a copy and sit back and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. No sleep. I promise.
