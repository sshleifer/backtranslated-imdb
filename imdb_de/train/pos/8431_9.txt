] Did not you see this movie? Have not you heard of this movie? It would not surprise me. As one of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last decade, no studio had any confidence in the image and it was never recorded for major distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited edition, virtually without promotion, and the majority of the major film critics did not even care about the review. I think a movie based on a One Act, a set on apartheid and its impact on two individuals, never really had a chance on the market today - and it's the loss of the intelligent movie lover. Both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover (as well as the cinematographer) earned Ocsar nominations. English: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = DE. but the film received such a little fanfare that I can not even blame the academy. This is a challenging, thought provoking and heartbreaking film, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on its own terms. In view of that, it's definitely not a movie for thoughtless entertainment. Director John Berry does not wisely disguise Athol Fugard's acting. Sure, we have some broken flashbacks and a few stunning scenes, but the movie version of BOESMAN AND LENA is, by and large, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions: their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) , have no one to attack more than yourself. A third character joins for a while (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never deviates from the title characters and what they've become. Bassett and Glover, as a broken couple, perform brave performances that simply could not be improved. BOESMAN AND LENA, who are intellectually as well as emotionally violent and brutally stimulating, deserve to have rediscovered the home video. Undoubtedly the best movie of the year 2000.
