Although this was not without fault, this Easter drama was appropriate. It reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest suffering and experiences. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the rapping teenagers who gave the drama a better musical accompaniment than the rather bad soundscore in the background. The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was great again. The highlight was very satisfactory, if rather simple. Timothy Spall's "letting go" of the suicide of his long-dead wife was believable and well reflected the feelings of desperation that existed in the teenage girl who had hurt herself. The solution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was pleasing, but less credible. A wonderful drama that made me and my husband say that the evening had been well spent. Congratulations!
