I do not know why people think that this is such a bad movie. It has a pretty good storyline, some good action and the move for Harry does not hurt either. Sure, some of the offensive and free, but this is not the only movie like that. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as a small town policeman. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, you should see this, it's way better than THE DEAD POOL. 4.5
