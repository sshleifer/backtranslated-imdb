This is the movie I've seen more than anyone else (I think I've seen it on average once a year since it was published). And every time I see it, it's just as fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most likely a combination of the best ever in ex-Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for every movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of movies everyone should have in their private video collection.
