Before she went into politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's best movie actresses. This film shows her talent, though he plays a minor role in a stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a British Royal Captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years, and Jenny, who in almost one role plays the American Ann-Margret played unknowable role as a cute sister. Alan Bates plays the captain, suffering from the memory loss caused by the garnet shock during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a lesser role than the doctor treating him. They see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. They can not help but watch Glenda play a burly housewife and the captain's first true love, but they came from different classes. It's not the greatest movie, but it's good to see Glenda's incredible talent. She is still a fantastic actress, a comedy or a drama. She makes Margaret Gray a sympathetic figure and you see why a royal captain fell in love with her.
