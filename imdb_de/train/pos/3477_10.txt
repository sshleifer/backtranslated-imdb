Some people think that the second series was the place where Scooby was ruined. I can not agree with that at all. The quality of the shows did not go up or down and unpleasant, you get my opinion as they are a very good changer. 72% of respondents said the second season of scrappy's scoobys was a fall. The charges said yes, but 28% still can not be wrong. I like the way most episodes focus on comedy The same 5 people / dog solving the puzzles in the same formula. Crappy was a breath of fresh air for the show. Sure, some people are voting, but when Scrappy was introduced, DOUBLE PICTURES were introduced. I was fascinated by the Yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day it is a matter of opinion, whether you like scrappy or not, is a matter of opinion, there is certainly no fact involved. But in my OPINION, this was a great series that gave a start to tire, to show a new formula and to save the life. Nuff said.
