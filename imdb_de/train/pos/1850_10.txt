This is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it at least ten times and cry every time. My family asks me not to see it, so I have no crying fit. I think I love that it's a true story written by Antwone himself, just as I love the movie. The acting is first class and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But that's my favorite movie he's done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious little boy I ever met. He was now adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie when the fight was still going on and its future was uncertain and I am so happy that it is safe and loved. And I am so happy that Antwone is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to learn more about him and find out how it has been since his meeting with his family. I just can not say enough good things !!
