The premise of the story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods stumbles upon the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police of the murder. Although there are very few dialogues available throughout the film, the visual narrative, which only tells the eye of the camera, makes the movie very appealing. The setting of the gray forests gives a feeling of loneliness, which complements the calm of the characters themselves. We also feel helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which corresponds to the inability of the silenced child to tell his own story. The real horror lies in the feeling of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully addresses these elements with images instead of relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror movies use when the narrative is weak. The story is developing at a slow pace of suspense for a few spooky and startling moments. The end is also unexpected and believable. Reminiscent of Japanese horror movies like "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horror movies like "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents". This film gives the audience the experience of a real atmosphere horror. I recommend anyone who enjoys the fear of the bone to try this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies I just mentioned, you might want to give them a try. Try it too.
