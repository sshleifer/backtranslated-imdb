A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So it may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera work, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original and in every way great - and very different from the trash we are unfortunately used to. Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and fascinating Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, her acting is unique - it's completely her own - neither "British" nor "American" or anything else I've ever seen. It is something fascinating. <br /> <br /> The long, unbroken, natural recordings are wonderful and remind us that we've got used to a few limited recording methods.
