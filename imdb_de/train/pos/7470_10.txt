I have Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge !! visited. Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was thrilled with the movie and especially TC's performance. I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the reviews and had decided not to go, I'm so glad I was. forced to see it. The strange thing is that I can not say why. All I can say is that I found it totally involved and could not stop thinking about it the next day. From what I felt about the movie, I can only say about ITS NOT THE STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever). It's about the people and the events that shape their lives, and how small events like getting into a car can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> To what the critics wrote , the original for Alejandro Amen√°bar was perhaps a stunning 2nd film, but this was a completely different interpretation of the subject and by no means a narcissistic remake in favor of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even think of writing some banal, smooth phrases to describe the film. <br /> Yes, I know, that's not a balanced, thoughtful review, but something. It is not such a movie.
