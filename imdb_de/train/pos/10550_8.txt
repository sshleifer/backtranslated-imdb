I saw this during my course at Aberystwyth University, and it confuses me that there is no distributor in the UK. Well, not really, because this movie is all that a Hollywood movie is not - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems that today nobody really wants to see this kind of movie because it simply does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers look for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I have not written a review for the IMDb for a long time, but I felt inclined to mention this movie, even though it's between lessons during my 30-minute break! Essentially, it's not about anything because the two main characters are immersed in their own world of nothingness through their hatred of the world. The brilliance here is how the director awakens interest with just two characters during most of the runtime, and when the only staging is half a house and a large white empty space. This is due in large part to the outstanding achievements of the actors, both of which offer great laughter and at the same time are able to give their roles a significant emotional depth. <br /> <br /> I'd love to do more, but I'm pretty limited in time. However, I encourage everyone and everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is brought to the canvas in a coherent and well-executed way. The combination of good performances, a strong script, a nice sound design and (pretty) impressive visuals makes for a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame that so few people know nothing ....
