Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The world's first glimpse of a 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr emerges in the early moments of the treasure trove of those thirties as she sweeps across the country screen in an angelic wedding dress. This should be the beginning of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to be clothed on canvas. It's Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband does not seem interested in her romantic advances. She retreats into the lonely bed and plays in a beautiful scene with her wedding ring, while the realization of her marriage mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in orderliness and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses beautiful camera angles and an unadulterated attitude to capture Lamarr's remarkable talent and beauty. Since no words were spoken at the beginning of the film, she can understand our compassion, our heart and our support. This combination prepared the audience of the 1930s for what they would see as the film unfolded. "Ecstasy" was shocking at the time ... Some found it scandalous. <br /> <br /> She returns home to her father's estate and returns to divorce. The next day, she awakens with a sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the landscape and the fresh air. Eva goes for a ride and passes a beautiful lake. In one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to get naked in a big movie. Her play in the forest and her adventures in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audience could not stay away. As with many of today's films, the controversy made the film a must. <br/> <br /> Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse who ran away with her clothes. After an unpleasant meeting they finally fall into each other. Her first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene with its blatant waves of eroticism. Machaty, however, makes beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates a wonderful moment in which Eve literally seems to sink into her new lover by using a beautiful early camera trick. <br /> <br /> It can not be overstated how brave this Lamarr performance was. Many would have thought it was suicide in their careers. Instead, she gained worldwide fame and noticed Louis B Mayer, who signed her with MGM. There are some really erotic moments in this movie, even by today's slippery standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very smart with his pictures and left a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we see and it is extremely well done. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover may be unavoidable. The consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes some unexpected twists in the final act, and all of this makes a great story and a nice debut on the big stage of the movie star for Hedy Lamarr tame the movie and ask him to search it in its restored form on DVD. It's worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is also captivating and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews !!!
