I really enjoyed this movie because I have a tremendous interest in American history ... the Antebellum years and especially the civil war. I recently bought it from a rack of previously viewed videos sold at the grocery store, and I was very happy to add this to my history video collection. Although this is not the caliber of civil war movies like Glory or Gettysburg, it does provide much of the story about the Brotherhood before the Civil War cadets in West Point. It may be the gray uniforms, the youth or the military discipline, but I am fascinated by the history of the cadet corps from about 1830 until the outbreak of the war. I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learn how to wage war, and later face the lessons to classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the film does not really mention this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, the first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, last graduate of the June class. The reason for the two classes was not so much the war, but it was the result of switching to a four-year study after several years of experimenting with a five-year experiment (I think the first class had done it five years ago other four). As the film shows, the cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say that this movie is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should have been because of the 1940 movie though he is fun, really fudges is history. Cadets from different classes all graduate together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as best friends and stand side by side to stop John Brown's 1859 uprising at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. They faced each other in Gettysburg in 1863 (for the first time, I think) (Stuart was at Harper's Ferry Raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it happened). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer "plays a role in" Class of '61, "though his classmate buddies Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictitious, and I think they're based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I enjoy this movie or any movie that offers a window into the mid-19th century America.
