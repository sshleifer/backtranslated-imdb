This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I've never seen an ad or a trailer so I did not know Clooney was in it and was not disturbed by the fact that his role was so small. I found the whole cast suitable and found the film very pleasant overall. The opening scene with the little bandit group standing on the side of the road, looking flogged and haggard, immediately caught my attention. There was a way to say, "Do not go away, it will not be boring," and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting, carefree comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in the seat until the very end, but when the end came I felt a bit cheated ... just a little , The events continued to build, so you expect them to continue building, but at some point I can not define, the levels level out and the ending is easily disappointed. I expect that I expected a bigger bang of a climax, but it turned out to be a rather modest tone. If you watch the movie against this background and live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this movie very entertaining and worth seeing. Now I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
