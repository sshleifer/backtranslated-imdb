During the first three seasons, Sabrina was a jewel hidden at TGIF (and later in the afternoon on the early afternoon). Each episode had a crazy, crazy energy and tempo that overcame the occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart had a great talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing "straight men" or being as straight as two witches, had great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. As a talking cat, Salem was free to take part in the crazy plan he was interested in, and you could laugh and take everything, because he was a talking cat after all. Sabrina's friends rounded out the social experience at school, which included the typical "bad cheerleader" and "totalitarian client." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to unite pop culture (eg, bands of the era, Jerry Springer), archetypal human states / morals (such as the meaning of friendship, the Christmas spirit) and the Internet literally Representation of such related metaphors in the magical realm. Unfortunately, the show, like so many other television shows, peaked in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina's high school attendance. By the beginning of Season Four, the move to college marked a drastic decline in the overall quality of the show, especially when the writers had chosen to introduce Josh as Harvey's rival, and Aunt Hilda and Zelda wished to remain on the screen with trivial excuses as key players , Last season, Sabrina's work in a pop culture magazine was clearly disappointing. However, Sabrina (especially the high school years) is still a unique entry point as a hybrid sitcom with magical elements that raises her above the tiring price that is produced every year in this genre.
