THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A movie based on a novel by Gerard Reve that works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, considering that Reve needs about a hundred pages for a small turn of action. Excitement is the last thing that comes to my mind when reading his work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is overwhelmed by symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally busy proving something to hostile critics, and I'm never sure what he's trying to prove. Usually he underestimates his audience and tells his story in such a subtle way that it quickly deviates from the original idea or plot, almost forgetting what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In "The Fourth Man" he does not describe the plot as well as with sex and nudity (of which there are plenty), but like most of his films, he seems to be scared that the audience and the gavel will not come home The story with open symbolism mingled with supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex and no frontal nudity, most of them are so free in vain and undermining an otherwise good story in your face. <br /> <br /> If you can handle Verhoeven's rather obvious satirical approach, this is still an entertaining thriller with intriguing twists and good performances, notably Thom Hoffman and Jeroen KrabbÃ©. > <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
