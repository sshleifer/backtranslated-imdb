I saw this movie with my girlfriend and we could not stop laughing! I mean, there was nothing scary about this movie! It was funny that all the lines that Freddy said were hilarious! I think they have not even made another nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. Jason Although some parts were crude (as the head blew up). and each Ulmenstrassenfilm 1 - 5 sucked. This was the best addition to number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to do to rent this, you will laugh a lot. I want to see the massacre of the chainsaw of Texas. I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead The Last Nightmare Overall Rating: B-
