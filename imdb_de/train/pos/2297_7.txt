Every "Hammer" movie I see takes me to a new fantasy world. Anything can happen in the world of "Hammer" movies. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those movie types. It dives deep into the occult and into hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
