GOJOE takes some getting used to at first, but the end result is very satisfying. The story of a murderous samurai who wants to recover by fighting a feminine but dangerous samurai is worth more than a guard. This is about much, from physical survival to soulful salvation. At first glance, the film may be a bit of an anime-inspired samurai movie, but it soon enters mature / adult areas. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the better Samurai movies after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> (see www.nixflix.com for a more detailed description of the film and reviews of other foreign films)
