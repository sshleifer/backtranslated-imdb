Red Skelton was still another big star who made the transition from film to television with ease. His shows certainly made American households laugh years ago. <br /> <br /> He would start the show with an opening monologue. After that, we would have different characters. Do you remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember an episode in which Red, as king, introduced his queen, calling her fatness. <br /> <br /> Be aware that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a son at the age of about 11 years to leukemia. His wife Georgia died by suicide.
