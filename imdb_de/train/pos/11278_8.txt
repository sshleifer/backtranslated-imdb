The first of the Tarzan films with Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summarized, so I do not want to go into it again. All you have to know is that the actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for this role. If you have not seen this movie and only use the modern Tarzan movies for reference, you are missing a real treat. It does not matter how far we got in the filming and make-up set. Nobody will play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller. He was and is Tarzan.
