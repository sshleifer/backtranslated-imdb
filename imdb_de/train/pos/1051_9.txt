This is a powerful documentary about domestic violence in Cameroon. The "sisters" in the law are lawyers who have successfully prosecuted husbands in 2004 for abusive treatment of their spouses and have wanted a woman to divorce that she desperately wanted via a Muslim council. It is quite a long one - about two hours - but fascinating both in terms of the individual plaintiffs and the defendants as well as the lawyers who have successfully represented them in courtrooms run by women judges. It will leave you, as it has left me, with many questions about exactly how this change has taken place. How and when did women occupy authority positions in Cameroon? Have the different cases in this film significantly affected the treatment of women by their spouse in general? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court a one-time event against the express wish of the husband? I do not suggest that the filmmakers could have answered these questions. They filmed the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.
