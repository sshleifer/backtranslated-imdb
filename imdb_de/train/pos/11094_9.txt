This smooth and coarse-grained film delivers consistently. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's by far the best Elmore Leonard adaptation (and if you scratch your head and think, "but I loved GET SHORTY," you have to slap in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the "feel" of Leonard's figures better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. Relocating the story from Detroit to Hollywood raises the story's sleaze factor to astonishing heights. Be a man, have some beer and watch this movie. For reference, my most popular Leonard books are Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a very special place in my cold movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
