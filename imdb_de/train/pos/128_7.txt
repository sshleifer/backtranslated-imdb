Von Trier once explained how he has created such a strong engagement of the viewer with his films, placing his film world in the center of the real world and the imaginary world. As a viewer, we believe that we see a "true" story as we are actually being thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie is disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots). Of course, the dogmatic films have served only as a vehicle for this theory (apart from the fact that they have created by Trier a welcome spotlight). The story is typical of Von Trier: Our hero is idealistic, seems to keep his balance with all others, but soon becomes a victim of the problems that others have created for himself in the past. The idealist must inevitably reject society in order to remain idealistic and become a terrorist. Humanity is corrupt and purity leads only to (self-) destruction. (These elements were also omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the film is wonderfully designed: blurring and hiding washed-out colors, screen overlays, actions on various overlays (with the upcoming mayor being the most interesting). In this film we can see how well von Trier treats film as a technical medium. In his later works, he seems to step down from this (as if he no longer cares about technical achievements because they are so readily available).
