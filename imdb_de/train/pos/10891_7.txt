You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was a bit run down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family who is ready to pay completely strangers. The Valcos with James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as daughter Lisa Valco. Drew is lonely during the holidays because he does not have a family of his own, and he lets a family out in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best because he played Maude's husband Arthur, is hired to play grandfather Duda. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The household of Valcos is crumbling, apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a startling visit. You can not buy what you want! Acting and writing are mediocre, but the first cast draws it into the final scene.
