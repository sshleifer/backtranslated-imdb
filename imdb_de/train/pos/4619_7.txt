First of all, I'm a big fan of 80's films and also Jennifer Conelly. Yesterday I went to a local book / movie shop and found a copy of VHS. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 it was a good deal. So I took it home and put it in the video recorder. What a cute movie! At my age, I now have more to do with films like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and fall in love with an older man we're younger if it does not work, we are heartbroken and we think that we will never get over it. But we do that of course. Many times. It's that kind of sweet quality that I really got from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all over. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s films, especially teen movies, or anyone who just wants to think about a simpler time in their lives.
