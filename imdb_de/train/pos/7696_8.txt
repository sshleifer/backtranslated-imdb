When "Good Times" premiered in 1974, this was one of the first black family sitcoms. The focus was on the poor Evans family based in Chicago and their efforts to make ends meet. Most early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their efforts to look after the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and had excellent chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J. J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was the rock-haunting but well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, smart girl who works constantly with J.J. Michael was a nearby prodigy who was well educated on social issues and was going to become a lawyer. In 1976, the producers made a big mistake when they fired John Amos, who literally killed his character. That really changed the focus and not for the good that I could add. The shows focused more on J.J. and his buffoon-like demeanor angered black spectators as well as series star Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show focusing on the main African-American themes that existed in society at that time, viewers got shows overloaded with rock-hunts and fat jokes. Show suffered even more. Although it was still worth seeing, it was no longer the great groundbreaking show it once was. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became clear that the show was on its last legs. All loose ends were tied during this season and the show was silently faded out of the air. First three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.
