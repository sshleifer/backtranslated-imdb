A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short topic. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps him change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is an entertaining little film in which Shirley Temple steals all her scenes as the hero's animated little sister. The opening gag, which deals with bedwetting, is tasteless, but quickly forgotten. Highlight: the climatic hostilities, which look impressively realistic. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, often overlooked or neglected, the short and single-track shorts were the studios as important training venues for new or budding talents in front and behind the camera. The dynamics with which a succesful short motive was created was completely different from a full length movie. This was more like a short story than a novel. Economical in terms of budget and schedule and able to present a wide range of materials, short topics were the perfect complement to the feature films of the studios.
