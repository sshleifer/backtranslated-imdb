Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960 to 1980. At the box office always strong and usually dramatic and exciting stories of casino robberies, mafia score adjustments and battles of World War II. Verneuil could rest assured that we have two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he has directed Yves Montand. It's a strangely static film that takes place mainly in offices and conference rooms, not just a scene of persecution and hardly any violence. Montand delivers a good performance, albeit a bit dry, and he is well supported by the movie's other actors. I do not wonder what Costa Gavras could have done with this story, based on Z (the murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
