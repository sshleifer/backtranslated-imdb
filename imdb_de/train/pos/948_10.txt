This is simply one of the finest depictions of Dickens classic history. The script follows very closely the story that Dickens originally wrote, creating a perfect balance between the movie atmosphere and the game atmosphere. Viewers who like both formats find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice. George C. Scott brings a wonderfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge and convinces in the character development inspired by the visits of the spirits. I found out he could win me to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, which was seldom done in other versions. The great work done by the supporting actors adds significantly to this production, which is simply the most beautiful of all the Christmas song versions I've seen.
