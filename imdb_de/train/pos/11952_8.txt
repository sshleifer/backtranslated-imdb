Scoop *** out **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was an excellent dark-romantic thriller that luckily did not play Woody Allen. It had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest movie, and although he appears in this movie, he is fine. It also marks Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work together perfectly. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the spirit of a lifetime from the mind of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.). Joe heard the shovel on a boat with the Grim Reaper and a pile of other souls the Reaper had taken. One of these souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter could be the serial killer wandering the streets of England. Joe travels back to the living with a ball of his life and gives this information to Sondra during a magical act. Sondra is at a magic show with magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She will voluntarily go into a vanishing box and while she is in the box, she receives the visit from Joe. Without knowing what to do, she asks Sid Waterman's help to help her solve the case. <br /> <br /> This film has a pleasant, light-hearted feel compared to "Match Point" and yet everything works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits in perfectly with this story and role. Hugh Jackman is great as Peter Layman, the "alleged" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a funny little movie to see if you have ever searched for a movie. The cast ensemble is working well together and the story is flowing and you sometimes forget that you see Woody Allen being himself. I say, give a chance because you might like it.
