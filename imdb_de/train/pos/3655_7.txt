De Sica becomes one of my favorite directors, but this was a hit for me. A grinning idiotic teenager becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and glittering story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and triggering police forces, but it is slowly becoming a magical fantasy story, while the boy wonders why Toto develops unlimited superhero powers. I did it with the always smiling toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic started I was in the dust. There were so many wonderfully orchestrated recordings, so many good characters among the settlers, that I always thought it was a waste, the film was not more serious with its material. The fusion of neo-realism and fantasy seems more like an experiment of the "look-and-do-can-do-mum" approach than a fully-fledged work of art.
