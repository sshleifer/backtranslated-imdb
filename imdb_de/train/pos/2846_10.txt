I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago ... AND I'd like to thank the people who worked on making this movie! most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I would like to hear it myself ... it's easy and accessible ... it's a movie where you can feel good after a bad day without regret It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have but we sometimes miss it because of the material stuff ... Look at all the time we have, but we miss it. ... why are we doing this? We have to live as if we were dying ... Take care of every second and remember: When we do good, good things come to us! HAppiness is real .. and it has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! Thank you for the movie and I apologize for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
