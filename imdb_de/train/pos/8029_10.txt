I'm curious about the rifle Beckett used in the movie, and also about the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to fire. If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's snipers, I suspect that it is a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. In the final sniper movie, he also commented on the rifle the Vietnamese man allowed him, which belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he considered it the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which rifle that is. I know that this special rifle was made around the 2nd World War or before. I could not see the movie exactly enough to recognize it. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Hathcocks, his biggest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed killings. After his wounds were somewhat healed from burning in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career with teaching snipers in the USMC and the skills they would need in this area. His sniper career is still mentioned by our brothers and sisters training in the USMC. I got his name from my friend, a former Marine. Any information would be great.
