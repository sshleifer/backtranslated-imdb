Two snipers are looking deep into the jungle looking for their targets. A slimy South American drug lord and a prominent general. </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> < p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> In most reports, the Sniper is a very solid thriller in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in maintaining the gloomy mood and could have made the story a little bit harder; Some detours do not add up much here. However, this film is far better than his Stallone / Stone-travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane, who is usually incredibly tiring, is surprisingly good as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. For Berenger, this film proved to be his last good budget for Hollywood. He can play this kind of role in his sleep, and he is very convincing here by repeating the role twice more directly in DVD sequels.
