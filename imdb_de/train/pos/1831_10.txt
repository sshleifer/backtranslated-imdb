This movie was pretty awful. Vipul Shah's last movie was good, this one was just bad, although it's a good story, and Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this movie from another Gujarati play, "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu," a good but slow pianful has been seen two and a half hours there are a lot of mistakes in this movie, but it is still an entertainer. The songs are pretty bleak and do not work well, but overall they are still good and not a movie you would love to watch, there is still a story to consider and it is good if you have the relationship type pretty good movie with many Errors and humor are really not even needed a bit
