Fortunately, we had this fantastic movie to see at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, we received a small opinion card, which was used for our personal evaluation of the film. Looking at the map, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can class as great? Only about 5 for me." But when I saw the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser as I watched the spectacular New York State scenery, I slowly began to top the film in a particular category. Surely it was fine, but the actor's completely natural repo and an award-winning performance of a man who's likely to remember for a raincoat with a detective rather than for this movie jumped to an outstanding level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and calloused heart melted like the Grinch's and I ended up making a great impression. <br /> <br /> This picture is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or nakedness, but a strong language.
