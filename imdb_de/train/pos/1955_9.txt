Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors as well as the only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-trained group of human lives and plays with her weaknesses to gain experience and write a murder mystery book. She plays the female psychopath pretty well, while convincing with her extensive sex appeal what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows. Tramell is used in dark places in society and is free to take part in sadomasochistic forays on the city's Never-After-Dark page. From the beginning there is only an R-rating from the dialogue. Stein could also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, an emotionless femme who is deadly without the eating plan.
