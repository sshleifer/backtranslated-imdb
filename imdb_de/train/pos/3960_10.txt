According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It's a bit difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously, as most of his films are shot on a very tight budget. Almost no USD. However, it is fascinating to note that Mats Helge eventually accomplishes something akin to an action movie. The Ninja Mission is, in my opinion, the best of all the films he has staged. Some special effects are quite pleasing. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. It's a "Z" movie - but a fun and funny "Z" movie!
