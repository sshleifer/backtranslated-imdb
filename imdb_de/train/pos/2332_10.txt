"Imagine, you could bring things back to life with just one touch." When I first heard this, my attention was focused on the trailer. After the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern fairy-tale fairy tale that keeps my spirits up and draws my attention throughout the show. I think that acting and casting are just perfect. Each character brings something unique to the show, which enhances its perfection. Even the only time the villains overflow with a unique feeling, from Bee Man to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to let me down. And the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being weird (like an exploding Scratch & Sniff book). <br /> <br /> Even with the huge amount of crime shows we have now, we now have a few days. Daisy is one of the few who really stands out from the others. Not only a mystery, but also a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a touch of drama, all baked in a wonderful cake. Irr show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was ABC. For years, I never had a reason to contact ABC. But that brought me back to my face every week with a smile. It was like Pushing Daisies bringing ABC back to life for me. But so, after two seasons, some awards, a big fanbase, and positive responses from critics, the show was dropped. It seems like Ned touched ABC again and killed it forever for me. However, I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to talk a lot and love the shows they see.
