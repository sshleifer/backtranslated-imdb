I thought that was a great movie. The title song is cute! :) The only thing that bothered me a bit was in the beginning, when everything should be normal. It was very funny and unrealistic. I'm talking mainly about the big cable company. Apart from that, the movie was very creative. I think all the plays were done well, the actors perfectly expressed the personality of their characters. Everything fits together well. It is a pity that they are not a soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this is a Canadian movie and because he is one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10 points!
