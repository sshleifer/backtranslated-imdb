The title caught my attention and I was wondering what will come out in the storyline as we've seen so many "Super People" movies in the last few years ... and I really liked it a lot as there were some unusual films funny scenes that I did not expect. In the role of G-Girl Uma Thurman played an average. Surprisingly, I was able to see her toes on the widescreen again (as at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson played the idiot who meets the tall woman very well, I could really get into his situation. If you want a touch of fun, be sure to watch the adventures of G-Girl and Matt, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
