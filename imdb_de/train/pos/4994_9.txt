Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. These are realistic events with really pleasant and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He lives on odd jobs and travels to a new city when things get boring. One night he meets Trina, a beauty who is cold and alone. She refused to use prostitution, so she did not eat for several days, but the two are doing very well and forming a relationship. His free spirit seduces him to abandon her, life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even if they live in a hut by the river. Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and understandable. We can see his thoughts on his face, which makes him easy to identify, even if we think he behaves badly. Young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but anything but perfect, which makes her all the more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Elements of the pre-code include thin diving, pregnancy before marriage and crime.
