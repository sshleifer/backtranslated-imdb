I have just seen this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother, who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. She was awarded the Havana sequences in which Simmons and Brando danced a storm. That was quite impressive for me and was usually the highlight of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film, which originated from a story by Damon Runyon, lasts a bit slower than the non-musical scenes, but draws you after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing for me, but especially during the "Sue Me" number its charm. In addition, Stubby loved Kaye's "Sit Down, You Rocking the Boat" number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical, but certainly a very good one.
