Some of the accepted Altman "masterpieces" now seem saddened. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "lesser" Altman (recently shown at FMC), though I do not think he's aimed at a broad audience. Organizational politics as "microcosm" for public campaigns. Part of this satirical "docudrama" is now obsolete, like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but I found many dialogues funny and enlightening (eg, "They are for real, which means you are not a threat to anyone "). The story is not "profound," but I liked it. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (as "he"), Lauren Bacall as an aging Conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a Member of Parliament) as a left-wing ideologue (in the opening scene, when she taught somebody as a carrot on the sanctity of politics) and Carol Burnett as a basket case. Everything in the inimitable Altman style, though perhaps not quite as inimitable as usual. But pretty inimitable.
