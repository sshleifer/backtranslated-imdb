At least for half an hour a week. I have not been interested in the big 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, though sometimes Larry can get annoying. I like the Middle Earth action figures they bring to Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. The show by Siegfried and Roy is sometimes entertaining. The animation is first class and definitely the best CG that was made on a weekly TV show. Usually, when they set big names to play in a show, they try to hide a bad script or characters. Not quite right in this show. However, there are a few characters that have been weakened and improved by the voice output, but overall, the characters stand alone. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 and up. There is nothing most children have not heard of, and most jokes would probably fly right over their heads. It's definitely not as rough and nervous as South Park, but it does have some of the same "Bash Everyone" features. An example is that at the same time it makes fun of Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Father of Pride and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like spiritual followers of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor that's grown up. It may not be as funny as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope that this season will end well and be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I may never find a reason to see the big 3 again.
