Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was obstructed by the director in this film. The end product is a very uneven movie with a very tangled story, but with amazing animation moments (like Emery Hawkins "Greedy"). Joe Raposo's repetitive music does not help either. It was created in widescreen format, so that the VHS does not show it in all its glory. Let's hope for a DVD in letterbox format one day. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to see some breathtaking animations.
