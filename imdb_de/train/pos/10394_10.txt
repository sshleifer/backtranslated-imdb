A magical journey by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of British cinema have put together some fabulous ingredients to make a masterpiece of the movie! Some of the most impressive early Technicolor, a Sublime and a shimmering Miklos Rozsa music score, together with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malicious villains of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as princess, all look wonderful. Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script, which is correspondingly terrific. DO NOT MISS THIS! Since posting the comments above, I have received the recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I never saw the picture properly until I saw this DVD version. The clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors are so alive that I was stunned. The amazing classic can be viewed again and again and again and again captivates and captivates the viewer. Another MUST SEE!
