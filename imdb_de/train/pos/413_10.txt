Sure, this movie is not historically accurate, but it's a great conversation. Most DeMille images, especially the later epics, are slow and cumbersome, but the action here is in a clip. The story essentially consists of a series of peaks with very few quiet moments. The action leads us from an Indian attack on a cabin; one of the best parts of the film, awarded to Jean Arthur, while trying to appease the war-painted natives. After that, she and Cooper are taken to the war camp and tortured there. Later, it comes to a lengthy fight with the Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous, but from beginning to end very funny and entertaining. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
