I love it when they really make a sports story. So many in the past were so hokey that it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really nice movie, an old-fashioned story - and based on a real guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who persuades himself to try late in the sporting field to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually he achieves his goal to make it into the Major League, even if it was just a very short stint. All the characters here are nice people, the kind you became, from Quaid to the players in his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a certain star on television.) Movies, he knows how you throw a baseball He looks like a launcher, a man who could fire 90 miles an hour. And most of this movie is true, as the real pitcher testifies in one of the documentaries on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a beautiful, inspirational sports movie, you can not go wrong with this.
