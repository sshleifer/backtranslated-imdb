My take: A stupid but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the timeline comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, which is a cult classic today. In this sequel, Bill and Ted have much more to do than travel through time. You could also travel heaven and hell! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted prepare for a "Battle of the Bands" competition that may make them more famous than ever. In a futuristic civilization, the time wizard from the first film (the ever-observable George Carlin) leads a university praising the names of Bill and Ted. There, a wicked tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plans to get rid of the idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical Android replicas (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do the dirty work. After that, Bill and Ted endure death and have to find their way through hell, inhabitants who contain the duke's worst memories, and then through the heavens, to return to Earth to save their girlfriends and their show. During this crazy journey, they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler, of DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the 1957 foreign-language classic THE SEVENTH SEAL. He helps some intelligent extraterrestrial beings and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY's series of excessive special effects is not up-to-date, and even the humor and temporary appearance are a bit dated (to be honest), the movie also feels like it's the wrong year been published, even for the 90s. But with nothing left to stand in the way of both the performances and the direction of fantasy and vibrancy, BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY makes fun, ingenuity and yes, fake. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
