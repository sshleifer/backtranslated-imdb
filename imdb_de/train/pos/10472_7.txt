Anyone who loves the music of Rheostatics will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mainly about the pace and the casting of certain actors (not Maury) that are not really convincing in their roles, but I have no time to write a detailed review. I would only warn anyone who has seen this movie or plans to see this film as a CBC television in Canada: The radiated version of the CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC. It cuts out entire scenes and negotiations (if possible) from the movie. The CBC, which presents most of the films untouched, took WHALE MUSIC half the effort. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did with the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but look at it NOT in CBC television.
