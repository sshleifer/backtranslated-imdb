Time is the future and for many who do not know, this day is now. In this final movie for the legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic. Many movie lovers and environmentalists believe that this is our final story. The film is from the novel "Make room, make room", whose working title has been changed to "Solent Green". History refers to the Earth, which is developing into the future, with the environmental problems of the world becoming catastrophic. The natural resources of the planet are depleted and the staple foods are reduced to simple staple foods. They are available in different colors, eg. Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green and are guilty of their own guilt and fear divine retribution. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated policeman named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks out the truth about his apparent suicide. Despite the corruption going to the top, she starts with Simonson's bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and chief of security Donnovan (Roy Jenson), who focus on a waste disposal plant on Thorn. Thorns boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes his suspicions, but warns him against those who want to close the case, but Thorn will not risk his "job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him for death but, like the movie, awaits one last warning. ****
