Few films can be viewed almost 60 years later and are still as compelling as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. The special effects used are notable for a 1946 movie. The show is great. David Niven, Kim Hunter and above all Roger Livesey do an excellent job. The use of black and white / color enhances the creative character of the film. It has not been on TV for 20 years, so few people are aware of its existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for so many years on the DVD release of this movie is in itself "A Matter of Life and Death".
