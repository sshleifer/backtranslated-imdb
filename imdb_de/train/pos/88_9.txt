This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film refers to real life and the question of how drugs can play a big role. Although it seems that this movie is being produced on a low budget, I found it exciting to see. <br /> <br /> Some may not like the story and say the script lacks the direction. However, when a person goes as deep into drugs as these characters, there is no direction to life. I believe this film is an accurate representation of what could happen to a person when exposed to extreme temptations. Most cast are newcomers to the industry. But they all did it very well. Everyone seemed to do a good job and understand the character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool when dealing with a person or a loved one who is dealing with drugs and seems to be spinning out of control. This movie could only frighten her to change her ways.
