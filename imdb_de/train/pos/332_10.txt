Although I have not seen this miniseries for over twenty years, I can still remember how the balance of character, plot and story of wonderful adventures has been achieved. The use of special effects was more restrained than that the story was described as poetic. The two versions I've seen have been dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language, not just Italian, so there's a synchronization problem. It does not spoil the story. Among the cast members, Irene Pappas is best known as Penelope for North Americans. Recommended for all followers of Odysseus' return.
