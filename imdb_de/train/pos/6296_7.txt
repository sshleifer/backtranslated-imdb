Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. He now works as a telephone counselor for a mental health hotline in Manhattan. One day his house usually burns. Parker and his cat bring it to life, but are now faced with the tedious task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. Parker learns that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood), is looking for a roommate but only accepts a gay man. Since Parker is straight, but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he is gay. Samantha likes him from the beginning and welcomes him as her new partner. But poor Parker. Sam is charming, intelligent and very desirable. How can he keep his true nature under control? Does not Sam have a successful businessman friend? This is a cute, likeable and humorous movie featuring two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is an episode of "How can I keep this cunning," with Sam asking Parker about shampoo as she takes a shower or asks him to keep her in bed when she gets bad news. In addition, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "wrong" gay colleague Boris, if Sam insists on arranging him with a man she knows. Hopefully, the gay community will not find this offensive as viewers felt that most subjects were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small film, the costumes, sets and camera work were pretty nice. So if you love these funny love stories, get them soon. You will like what you see, I know it.
