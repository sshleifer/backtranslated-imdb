This is one of Sammo's great early comedy films. This is not a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly for a man of his size. Nominal story about how his fight gets his family in trouble - and then to fight. Oh, the fight. Good, fast-paced, high-impact scenes (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he's really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). There's a Jim Kelly guy (one of three experts hired to kill Sammo), but he was a Chinese with an afro wig. Well, did not you have real blacks in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I've seen enough white "Chinese people" in old American movies too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the fans of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
