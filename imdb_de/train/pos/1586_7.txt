Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate film than a film of epic proportions, which could stop many visitors from finding a pianist-like plan. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good scriptwriter, chooses a feminist gaze for an era that is too much portrayed on its colorful exterior, but too little in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of the ordinary Aryan German rather from a Jewish perspective. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung loads of people who are trapped in historical circumstances and whose victims they represent as victims. The tempo of the film is introspective, poignantly slow and meditative. In addition, the characters are so alive while the transitions between the generations and the passage of time have been made clever. The Rose Road is not a masterpiece, and some mistakes in the story are easy to spot. Another mistake lies in a trivial cinematography that can not capture the intensity of the characters' inner drama. Nevertheless, this movie is worth seeing. After all, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films, dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past that includes such great films as "Nowhere in Africa" ​​and, more recently, the controversial "Downfall." I would recommend this movie to those who can read beyond the pictures.
