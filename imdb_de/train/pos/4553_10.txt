As far as I know, the real actor the actor is playing has seen his performance and said it was an excellent performance, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a pretty gifted guy / boy with a special body part that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA win and Golden Globe nominee Daniel Day-Lewis plays the crippled Christy Browna man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot, he can write, paint and hold things with it. He learns to talk later in the movie, it's very good for a guy like him. Home Alone 2's Oscar winner Golden Globe also nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA won Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. It was nominated for Best Director for Jim Sheridan for the Academy Awards Best Writing, Screenplay Based on material from another medium and one of the best images, it was nominated for BAFTA's Best Picture, Best Make Up Artist and Best Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 in the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, number 20 in the 50 Greatest British Actors, number 9 in the Finest Actors in the UK and number 15 in The World's Greatest Actor The film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Outstanding!
