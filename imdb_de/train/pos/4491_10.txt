I love this movie "Spring and Port Wine". I was born in Leigh, a city about 11 km from Bolton. In 1965 I moved to Bolton at the age of 20. My job was daily through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes by bike, but then by car, if I could afford it. The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors, who were almost always broke, but would always help you , if you could. Fred Dibnah was around the corner from Bromwich Street, where my beds were. If you have not seen the movie on its first release, you may be awarded a comparison with a soap like Coronation St. Well, I agree that it is a soap, but then it was called "Kitchen Sink Drama!" Watch this movie for the talented performers who soon became household names on television. Above all, I look after the recordings of the location and the feel-good factor of the people who are poor but happy!
