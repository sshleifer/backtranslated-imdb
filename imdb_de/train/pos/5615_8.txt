A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Very well done and Polanski is a good opponent, who tries tenaciously to adapt to his dingy Parisian quarters and his roommates. Already frightening because of the seemingly mean and self-obsessed roommates and later frightening as he develops his defensive measures that will eventually be his ruin. Personally, I could have done without the cross-dressing element, but I accept the bow to psycho and the fact that it had some logic in mind when considering the plot. Even so, it could have worked without it and would have removed some of the theatrical element, but perhaps that was intentional because the courtyard would end up acting like a theater. I can not help but feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings that he is not a "true" Frenchman and Jew. Still, there's a lot to enjoy here, including a good performance from the gorgeous-looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is more reliable than ever.
