Fast and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, I'm not from the South, I'm not really into Country music and have never worn a cowboy hat. (I've never driven around in a car with a dead body in the trunk, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is just a great movie. Shot in an aspect ratio of 2.35 and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS had 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story in Texas, with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. Besides "Pulp Fiction", it's the best he has done. It's been in my top 5 for 25 years! <br /> <br /> Check it out !!! It's a 10 !!!!
