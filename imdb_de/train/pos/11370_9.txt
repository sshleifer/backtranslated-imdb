Spoiler - as far as I describe characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The theme is both grim and gripping. The stubborn determination of Stephen Rea's character Burakov is simply mesmerizing. With all due apologies, his hangdog, which is constantly on top, serves him well. He is grim, as we would say in TV show Inspector Taggart in England, because he sees three murders a week. Well, that's not exactly how Chikatila operated for several years ... <br /> <br /> You get a sense of the blankwall resistance of the USSR bureaucracy, of Joss Ackland (who often made for appears brilliantly) This kind of role). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I'm writing this as a remake of Body Snatchers Invasion on BBC1) is the Donald Sutherland character "Mikhail Fetisov". His calm support from Burakov is steadfast. And that sticks through the perestroika and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is an absolute must for me.
