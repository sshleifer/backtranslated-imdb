This is a cute little horror movie that fans of indie films really appreciate. It has good acting, a lot of gore and a neat plot. You are reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It's obvious that the budget was not too big, but the movie really does make up for it with the atmosphere and solid representations of the actors, which seems to be lacking in many of today's budget-rich special effects films. The film is really moving and there is good direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. Besides, it looks like the end leaves an opening for a sequel, which would also be very interesting. So grab popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this.
