I was about 11 years old and found out that I live 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Hirschpark, TX. They have been adding houses since the movie was made. I do not know the house number, but you can look it up. I'm 21 now and I like to watch this movie. The bar at Spencer is no longer hers. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school. I drove by the house last week, the house still looks great. My dad and uncle went to the street where the house is located and watched the actors come and go out to make the film. Where John crosses the railroad cracks, they are 225 higher. When I heard John let go of his son, I think about it when he made cowboy in the city, who was then 26 or 25 years old.
