I have to start with Ed Furlong here. You gotta. God bless this child. $ 5 says that the character he plays in this movie is really like that in real life. He has one or two liners that have almost brought me to a standstill because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years, and it does not seem that Furlong is acting at all. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet that guy is really like that in real life." Does Madsen have to act at all? Just natural. Vosloo evidently developed from the type-mummy type. I think the biggest surprise of this movie was the performance of Jordana Spiro. Her reactions are just right in this movie. I fought whether she was hot or not, but I realized that I would like to see more of her. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of movies with movies. But I'm a fan of movies with many twists to try to guess. It's not just your standard robbers who take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win at the end of the movie. The twists keep coming ... and come. <br /> <br /> Caf√© scenes work best with hand cams to show what it really looks like. Not a bit glossy. Think of Bourne's ultimatums "lite" style in some scenes in the cafe. <br /> <br /> And for the Bo Bice fanatics out there - the actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will double you. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> When I looked, I wondered why some actors had foreign accents and what they did in this little town. In the end, it made sense that these people smuggled things into other countries / states so they could have those accents. In the bonus features, as some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with some of their stars, of whom we may not have heard anything yet, more is revealed. And some are smoking hot. Monica Dean? Do I have to say more?
