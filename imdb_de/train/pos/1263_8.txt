I enjoyed this movie, but it's mostly because I enjoy seeing Sean Connery, and this one has the added bonus of bringing Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne with them as well. The story has a granny looking for Connery's help because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongfully convicted. At first glance, there seems to have been some racist aspects of the case. Later, however, it turns out that the main officer of the case himself was black, and it seems he did some bad things to get the boy a confession. Well, the boy is trying to point out another murderer who is locked up in the same jail, which is about to die. He is also a particularly disgusting person as he is very pleased with what he has done writing the families of his victims and trying to get people to send them. Many twists and turns in this part, some of which are somewhat unexpected. I just liked that Sean Connery's character tried to understand the whole ordeal. The movie has also made me crazy in areas, especially if you find out what happened in the end. They get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, as they all shine pretty well in this case. In the end, this makes for a pretty good thriller.
