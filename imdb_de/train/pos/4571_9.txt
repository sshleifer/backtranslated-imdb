The most important thing about this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a Guinea artist and fighter who, despite her physical condition, had overcome all odds. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was terribly convincing. The tremendous support Christy received from his family, a low income, the Dublin working class, encouraged him to make the impossible possible, and this image that brilliantly illustrates this support was not read in the book, but the dialogues became clever written to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially classic movie lovers.
