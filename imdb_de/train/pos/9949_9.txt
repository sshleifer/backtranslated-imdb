This is a nice surprise. Cute little story about the search for the heroine, very surprising transformation of the type of soon crazy four-eyed prissy to a slippery DD-Cup sex queen. <br /> <br /> A visual sight for aching eyes, not just for two pretty impressive actresses, but also for (usually) the costumes and make-up of the actors. A little unnecessary price was caused by a ridiculous castle imitation. <br /> <br /> Back to the positive aspects: The film is seasoned with unusually explicit camera shots that you would not expect in a soft core. Loved this scene with the icicles, absolute classic potential. A slight minus only for (very) odd odd scenes in which poor behavior by smaller performers briefly lifted the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including an additional credit for the serious drooling effect.
