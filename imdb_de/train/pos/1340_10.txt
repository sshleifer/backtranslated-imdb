This documentary was interesting, but it was also long (as long as it takes a total of 225 minutes), like Ben-Hur long. But if you want that, this is for you. But only if you have a passion for movies, like me. Since Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (live and maybe even ever), this is very fascinating, especially if you know the style of Scorsese's work. Because then you can understand where he was inspired for many of his films. Not the best documentary ever shot, but it's a jump for Scorsese, always good to see. ON
