If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (like me) that you just have to watch the movie, you need to understand that you need to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story, Vonnegut himself and you may lie do not bring a human mind to the screen. His whiteness and humor simply can not be transcribed through a script or even the best acting performance. I believe that this film poses the most important questions Vonnegut poses in his book, but the frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not on screen. Does that mean that the movie misses the target? Of course not. In my opinion, the film is successful because it does not try to replicate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those who are too lazy to leaf through a page). It succeeds because it captures the basic elements of a story created by one of America's true art treasures, and presents it in a setting with no pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut's books, in which the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and lose control of his own craft. I would not call this movie one of the best I've ever seen, but it stands on its own legs as one worthy of being seen. Mother Night tells his story brilliantly by taking Vonnegut's "voice" out of the film's narrative or trying to insert it as it is possible.
