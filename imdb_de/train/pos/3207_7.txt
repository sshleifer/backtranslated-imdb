Of course Soldier is a very bad movie for any standard of film criticism. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier who has grown up killing since birth, but then became obsolete after being defeated by a bunch of truly super-soldier soldiers on a hanging hoop that looks a bit like a gladiatorial contest without the crash mats Leaving a junk planet, he is friends with a community of naff space hipsters who teach him about gardening, family life, and ume breasts. Kurt does not talk much. Finally, the really great soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is counted. The end. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not launch a new Best Explosion category, Soldier will not win prizes. As ridiculous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since aliens (especially the APCs), and at 90 minutes, it's not welcome. Please note that the mark below is only a guide.
