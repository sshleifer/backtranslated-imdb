I really thought that was not so bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was by far the strongest artist. Patricia Arquette has played too much most of the time. He actually played cello, which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. He is also an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy Add that to the talent, and everything he's done so far is much more bearable. He always gives everything, even if some of the projects he was involved in did not get the highest score. In most cases, not the fault of the actor. Unfortunately, he has been involved in some strange movies that did not play at the box office. Always with A-List cast members, but not always a "hit". But he is "worth every penny" of a borrowed or purchased DVD. Experience the wedding date with Debra Messing - one of his best films. EVERY CENT VALUE! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, then understand this quote!)
