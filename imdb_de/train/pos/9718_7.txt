POSSIBLE SPOILER - In a sense, "How to alienate friends ..." is the "loser learns to adapt, succeeds and finds out that something else matters". - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy delivers some good moments. However, I think that the end is flawed. It felt too fast and too abrupt, as if something was missing. In addition, I would say that the film is not able to maintain a high level. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with some controversial acting qualities. So far, I never saw Pegg differently. Still, he's a very unique guy, though he sometimes looks a bit boring on screen than he needs. Fox has proven that she can play a hot star in the clouds with her head. I do not know if it was a difficult thing, but their performance was hot and much better than "Transformers" (okay ... probably this is not a difficult game). Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you like it (like me) or it annoys. On the other side you see Anderson, who has demonstrated her acting skills, and Jeff Bridges (who is okay, but he might have been a bit more powerful). They all fit well with their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice celebrity comedy with more and less funny passages, a sweet cast, but an all too sudden end.
