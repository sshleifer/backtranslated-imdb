Solino really moved me with his deeply drawn characters. While it was a simple rivalry between two brothers, it was not just about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I identified with the feelings Gigi was experiencing, especially when he had to bring his mother back to her hometown in Italy and missed attending the award ceremony of the festival, which included his film has been. Seeing this figure, who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother, was so frustrating. Even in the end, when he makes another attempt to reach his father, he was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never pass their walls to reach their children. I even identified with Giancarlo, the brother who was self-confident and older, but had so many insecurities. A really nice movie that made me laugh and cry.
