You can debate Prince's acting talent or even his decision to parody his own life in this film. There is no debate today about his musical talent. He seems like a shadow twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> After experiencing the hype of this movie (high school graduation in '85), I can tell you that at that time there was nothing bigger. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife), who tried to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun through the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), to every "Air Band" that existed when she was Prince which was absolutely the hottest thing. At least for a few weeks, Prince was taller than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We were all waiting for the movie and were sooooo excited when it premiered. It did not disappoint. Everyone was caught up. I was an MTV junkie at the time (they always played music ... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I have to qualify this comment by saying that my favorites back then were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the punk / new wave genre. "The music of Prince exceeded all styles and styles. One of the reasons some of them are so cheesy and rude now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big back then. All things that are reminiscent of the eighties were iconic at the time. It was mainstream and now seems to be a clich√©. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like the rap granny commercial for Wendy's hamburger. <br /> <br /> It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was trapped in it (sad, kind of like a bizarre purple Macarena or something ... Anyway, I hope that gave you all a little insight.
