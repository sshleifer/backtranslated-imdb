I had not seen this movie since the late 80's and opted for the VHS version. The plot is very slow and the actors act almost like robots in this breakdance movie. The music, hip hop / freestyle artists and the break dance scenes make this movie something special. The breakdance is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin '", but I have to say that "Breakin' 1 & 2" transmits the energy and the tension to the screen. It's a movie I'm going to keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch over and over, just once in a blue moon.
