I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially as it is based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as an English loner, who took over the role of the dog breed Gray Owl. The photograph was beautiful. <br /> <br /> In this film, I researched this character, whom Archie Belaney simply referred to as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as possible about him. At the time, I did not know that Richard Attenborough had run it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films, whether he acts or directs. I rated it the highest rating. However, I would have liked to see more in the movie why he accepted this person since only the two aunts were shown who raised him and his room in their house. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a nice story without hearing dishonest language and inventing special effects every few minutes.
