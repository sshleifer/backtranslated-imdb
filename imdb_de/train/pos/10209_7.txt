"Happenstance" is the New York Parisian movie I've seen since "When the Cat's Away". <br /> <br /> Last year's movie released to attract attention Audrey Tatou chose "Amelie", her French title is more appropriate: "The Beat of the Butterfly Wings", summarizing chaos theory as a defining element in our lives. <br /> Tatou's Gamin-Ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally lights up that dazzling smile between her hapless adventures and because she's part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble that's so extensive that I could take a long time The Characters Especially since some of the cute guys and older women looked the same to me, they fantasize about what they should do, so I was not sure if they did or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subways and caf√©s. <br /> <br /> The subtitles made both parts of the dialogue rather annoying once. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 08.12.2001)
