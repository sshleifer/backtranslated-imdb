Ching Siu Tungs and Tsui Hark A Chinese Ghost Story is not only one of the greatest Wuxia Pian films of all time, but also a beautiful and romantic love story and an impressively choreographed martial arts movie that should be part of every movie lover's collection. The heavily missing Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector spending the night in a haunted temple. During his stay in the temple, he encounters a colorful cast of characters, including the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the devil of trees and the beautiful spirit of Lit Sin Lakes played by handsome Joey Wong He has to reincarnate her body and travel to the Underworld to defeat an evil demon. <br /> <br /> Enough good things can not be said this movie. The pace is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverish finale should barely give you a chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended way too soon) really makes the viewer feel for both. In fact, acting as a whole is so alive and full of life, I would say, this is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever seen. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious swordsman Yin. His towering personality of a disillusioned swordsman who wants to defeat evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score, lush cinematography with stunning colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung complete this wonderful movie. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
