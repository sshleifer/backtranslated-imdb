Soylent Green I thought it was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old and there are no special effects of acting one can best describe as "cheesy", but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story evolved at the right pace at a simple pace. <br /> <br /> The next modern equivalent would be "Dark Angel" regarding the representation of the United States Third World Land.
