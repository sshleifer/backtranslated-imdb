There have been several films about Zorro, some of which have even been filmed in Europe, eg. Alain Delon. This role was also played by outstanding actors like Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me Reed Hadley has always been the best of times. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, in which you only discover the true villain Don del Oro in the end. The series also has a good performance by various actors of the films B like Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance by Hadley as Zorro. He was fast, smart, and used his whip and his sword well, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
