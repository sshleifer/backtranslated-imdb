Yes, as the other reviewers have said, this may not be vintage L & H, but it's not their worst job by far than 20th Century Stupid ... I mean, Fox. This film certainly contains all the basic ingredients for the guys to do something wrong. But it is her serious approach and determination that makes her funny. They do not make it laugh like other comedians, but they take their work and situation very seriously and that is the core of their eternal humor. In this film, they are confronted with some of the fundamental problems that each of us might face today, namely job stress. First, we were examined by a doctor and he prescribed us urgently needed rest and maybe a stay at the sea. This is where the surreality comes into play. L & H are becoming increasingly plausible and exaggerating, but never so far as to be unbelievable, except perhaps now and then. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their self-induced predicaments and attempts at liberation. This makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this movie, all of these ingredients are presented in slapstick in a lovingly artful and graceful way. Not the best in comparison to their previous work, probably because this was the last film they made for Roach because it reflected the "big" studios and wanted to focus exclusively on creating features. BIG MISTAKE! They should all have stayed together and maybe continue for another five years. What the world might have missed if it does not consider this an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy this as your last great achievement.
