To be honest, I did not review this movie because of the stars - though they were reasonably observant and captivating, especially the three tracks - or even the compelling story of a break in presidential secret service (something, I'm through the DVD extras this one Show has been informed, but has never happened before. Assuming that's true, that's remarkable!). I got it because it was judged and has a pick-me-up of none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Okay, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) TV director. I would say that he is doing a project that is respectable but, despite the possibilities, is quite average as best he can. Veteran and Ass secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) needs to find out Both of them who blackmailed him AND killed his friend blew up an Air Force One helicopter and blew it up at the Prez. (David Rasche, who still remembers "Sledgehammer"?). His affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first ladies of HOTTER we ever had, whether fictional or real) certainly does not help him. He must both locate the real mole on duty and avoid the hunting dog as well as the hunting of his former best friend and co-worker and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost always in "24" mode). Throw in some other key service staff (Martin Donovan and the Foxy, a bit hard to buy such as the appearance of Eva Longorria) and dodgy foreign characters, and you have a pretty normal political thriller that does not look as high as he wants and that desired goal achieved, if not very impressive, results. <br /> <br /> The summary line describes how best to describe this show without a spoiler. The DVD extras were more enlightening and interesting to me than the movie, though the movie itself was entertaining enough to hold most of it (myself included).
