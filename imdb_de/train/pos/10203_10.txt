I love the movies and the comics, the comics are different than the movie, but I would give it anyway: 10 out of 10. It was fantastic. If the movies were more great. I have their babies. And I am female. Read the comics, you will not regret it. Yes, in this movie, since Brian P. the artist died for her, we do not get nearly as good artistic work. I mean, seriously, do not get me wrong, these people did a great job, but different versions for different people. Different strokes for different people, as the saying goes. Any guy who does not make fun of them is crazy or does not like women, or you just know you have a madness plan. If I could count on my fingers, how in love and how often I read the comics, I would certainly run out of fingers, but there are always toes.
