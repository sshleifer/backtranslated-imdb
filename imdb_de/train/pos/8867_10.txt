I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby will eventually appear on DVD. The episode with Georges eccentric genius brother George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne) is a classic hilarity factor. It reflects the classic rivalry of siblings and the love between brothers whose lives have taken different paths, but both were happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad have brilliantly regained the chemistry they had shared on the Cosby Show over many years. To bring them into a more bourgeois role, it shows what dimensions they can have as an artist. <br /> <br /> The list of comedic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
