Remember these two stories lovingly and in the first, in the not too distant future settled future, we see a little boy preparing for the exam day, the condition i.q test. The boy is a little confused about his parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done so and are finally taking the test. On arrival he receives an injection and is curious why. The examiner smiles and tells him it's just to make sure he's telling the truth. The boy then asks confused, why not? It is later, and the parents anxiously wait on the screen when a message appears stating that the state is sorry, but their son's iq level has exceeded the national quotient and politely asks if they wish a private funeral , A corker of a final scene! A Message from Charity was a heartwarming story about a fortuitous mental connection between a past girl and a man from the present. Which fits into a strange story of witchcraft reproaches from the past and the history pages of the present. A beautiful story with a heartwarming conclusion.
