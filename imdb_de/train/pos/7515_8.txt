I've known about Bettie Page for many years. The softcore porn pictures of her from the fifties have become iconographic and still have a strong appeal. The "Bettie Page" look is still very popular in the hetero-fetish world and remains as unique today as it was then. So I first saw this movie with some familiarity. The result was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was extremely entertaining to see how the film imitated real characters like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager. Everyone looks at the trailblazer today. Mary Harron has done an excellent job to create the desired ambience of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America, along with a sexuality that is extremely innocent by today's standards. I particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual acronym for the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie was. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol has done an excellent job to showcase Bettie's character in all of her innocent sexuality and all her naivety. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved the attention, did not look at anything nude and liked dressing in "dumb outfits" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and the deep fetishistic desires, all they evoked, were completely lost to her. To this day she still does not understand "what the hustle and bustle was all about" when it comes to her pictures or their S & M content. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that she is uneducated or too simple I understand, it's just that she simply does not understand fetishism and never will. No harm there. Bettie Page is just the way she is. The movie has captured that pretty well. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the fifties, presented by Mrs. Harron and written by her with Guinevere Turner, makes me really happy that I am the same age I live. The hypocrisy and oppression, combined with the massive ignorance of our sexuality, combined into a frighteningly overwhelming world. The film captures this well and brings cheer as Bettie endures everything with her unshakable faith and steady naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit slow at times, but hit all the points that Mrs. Harron tried and hit you well. I would also recommend this film to people who have little or no idea who Bettie Page was and what impact she had on American culture. For those with such interests, this movie is a must.
