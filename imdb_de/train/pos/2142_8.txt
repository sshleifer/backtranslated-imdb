This is a very real and funny movie about a Japanese who has a midlife crisis. In Japan, ballroom dancing is not allowed. When Shohei Sugiyama is obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio, he is suddenly enrolled in dance classes. Nobody is any more surprised when he starts liking him than he does. But he has to keep his secret pleasure from his employees and his family. When the truth comes out, that's pretty funny.
