The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short film, not because of the subject (adultery) or because it's animated (Winsor McCay introduced Little Nemo in the movie at the time), but because it's about mistakes that tell the story. Originally, Ladislaw Starewicz wanted to film real bugs, but because of the hot lights they were wearing, could not put them in front of the camera, so he took dead and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movement to his satisfaction. This short film is well suited to give little creatures human characteristics, such as motorcycling, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this. If you are interested in this and the other short films mentioned above, you can rent the DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and Other Fantastic Tales from Image Entertainment at your local library.
