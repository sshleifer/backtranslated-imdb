The first time I saw this movie was a little boy in the 1980s. My dad actually took it from the TV. I must have seen more than 20 times before the relatively recent release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was amazed at how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film was indeed very dark thanks to the dialogue. The new version with Van Der Beek and others is rather funny. <br /> <br /> To put it another way, it's like seeing the original version of Akira in the US with this dub before the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> I'm not complaining in any way, the story and the quality of the animation are not affected, but it begs the question whether Miyazaki is intended for a lighter or darker narrative theme in his movie ... ..
