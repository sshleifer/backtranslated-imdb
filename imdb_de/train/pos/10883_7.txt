This is surprisingly well above average, it's fun and well done, with some decent blood! All the characters are decent and the story is fun, and Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought it for $ 1 in a pawnshop, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were damn good for the budget. I also loved the mask the killer wore because it was actually a bit scary. The final was really cool because I loved how they beat the killer. The end was predictable, but also amusing. In addition, all characters except Ringwald were surprisingly sympathetic! It's been decently done and written, and I sometimes found it quite creative and original, and some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer did not play around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) really should enjoy this movie. Plus The opening was really bad, because they filmed the movie! This is a surprisingly above average slasher that is fun and well done, with some decent blood, and I say it's worth the clock! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall is doing well! Job here with solid camera work, with a scary setting, good angles and a fast movement of the film. The spectacle is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well, and I had problems, she was sorry, after all, what she should actually be the heroine, she was better towards the end, but not much, I'm surprised that she chose this movie Nevertheless, she did an excellent job! Frank Roberts is awesome as a murderer, he's menacing, creepy and had a damn mask, and this guy did not mislead, he was awesome! Kylie Minogue plays very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and goes like the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. All in all, the clock is worth it! *** of 5
