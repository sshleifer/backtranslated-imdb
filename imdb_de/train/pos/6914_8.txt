This movie features one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfuss, an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not recognize the cheater. Also this movie is funny, but also has a serious side. What is particularly fascinating about this film is the character Madonna, who is the lover of the dictator, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's development from Mistress to Political Leader has contributed significantly to the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who is a fighting actor and a certain buffoon at the beginning of the film, is also developing and has respect at the end of the film. I liked this movie.
