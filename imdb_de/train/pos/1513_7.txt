This movie is another horror anthology. It's pretty good, but it could have been a bit more useful. I compare it to Doctor Terror's House of Horrors, although the title fits in this title. It has four stories, all connected by a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife who move in. He creates a murderer for his latest novel and begins to see the killer walking around in his house. This is predictable, but raises a few twists at the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where it's going. This shows Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the group. This guy buys the house, but not the house is in focus, but a strange waxworks. The third story starts pretty well and includes Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather bizarre father who terribly protects his daughter. The problem is that the story does not end quickly enough once you know what's going on. It subsides a little and leads to a very predictable conclusion. The last story is about an actor buying a cape from a small shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there's a little story about an officer constantly trying to figure out what happened to that actor, and then explaining why those things happened. While I was not very happy with the explanation, I do not think it really explained the history of Cushing. I think they needed a bit more backstory for that. All in all, it was an interesting series of stories.
