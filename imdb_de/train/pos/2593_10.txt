It comes from the left field and REALLY is not what you expect. But I love that. The most memorable movie experiences come from surprise, if you ask me. If you have not been briefed on the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange, then you'll be looking forward to a treat. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but not so much it is noticeable. The special effects come from nowhere (seriously, it's like a weirdly dark romantic comedy, until they do - then WOW) and they're great. The overall cinematography is eye-friendly, the processing and the sound are of very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clich√©s. None of these aspects makes him a blockbuster, "What the hell?" Alone makes it a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> The people who beat this movie do not make sense. It's one of those much-overlooked 90's movies you either have never heard of, or that you love so much when you mention the title. <br /> <br /> I belong to the second group.
