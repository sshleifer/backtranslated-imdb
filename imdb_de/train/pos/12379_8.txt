When this movie came out, I was in an old theater in northern California. As good as on DVD, it's even scarier and scary on the big screen. Although it's been around 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my absolute favorites. At the risk of sounding banal, "they just do not do it anymore!" If Sixth Sense freaks you out, this movie is definitely for you! Great plot, incredible character traits, threatening environment; Even the soundtrack has a haunting quality. I can only recommend that you do not see it alone. For which a brownstone apartment was leased in 1977 alone, you will gasp for air.
