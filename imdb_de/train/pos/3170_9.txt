Author / director / co-star Adam Jones is set for big things. That was the thought I had after seeing his feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely does an independent film feel as good as its own. Cleverly written and masterfully directed, Cross Eyed keeps you from the beginning to the end. Adam Jones may not be a household name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two Named Actors, that would be a sensation in the Box Office. I think it still has a chance to be seen by a mainstream audience when only a movie distribution company takes the time to shoot this movie. No matter where it ends, if you get a chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
