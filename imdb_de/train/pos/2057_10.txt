There was no day in 2002 when I was not followed by a scarecrow. I felt that this movie handled a serious problem well. <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories as it was so realistic. <BR /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares about corn cobs and can not even go near the canned food for fear of my life <br /> <br />, I have to admit though, sometime in the movie I had him switch off because he came too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, you could check out this movie for what it felt like to us < br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn, believe me, I was there and I have the scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie It's amazing and educational
