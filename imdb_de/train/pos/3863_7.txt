This is an interesting series that takes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) with them ... and dramatizes some of their real history with a serial serial character involved in this story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in finding famous Old West outlaws in stories based, at least in part, on true stories. In this sense, it's almost an anthology series, and as someone else points out, this weird structure raises conflicts with actual events, but it's a fun, action packed series to satisfy a Western-hungry 1950s audience - and it's still doing pretty well 55 years later. Clark makes a strong figure in his western gear as he tackles some of history's most vicious evil. And his buddy Frankie is quite a plate. If you're a Western fan, make sure to check if you have a chance.
