"All the world is a stage and its actors in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said the theater stopped at the orchestra pit - or even at the theater door? Why are not the viewers involved in the theater experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experiment that said, "Hey, the story is you and it takes more than your attention, it takes your active participation". "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to history." Unfortunately nobody listened, but that does not mean it should not be said.
