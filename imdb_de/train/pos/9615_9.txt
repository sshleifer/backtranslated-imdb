This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, which summarizes the chaos theory by narrating the wings of a butterfly and causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, bug is all about it (or at least something, do not worry, it's not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious guy and I do not believe in certain stuff, destiny, etc., but this movie definitely makes you wonder, if there really is a coincidence ... <br /> <br /> In addition, acting and camera are excellent. Further proof that it is still possible to make a good movie without tens of millions of dollars
