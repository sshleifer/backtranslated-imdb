"A Bug's Life" is like a popular chocolate bar - it's full of great little pieces that make something really delicious. <br /> <br /> The story could not have been better; It's smart, has "heart" (emotion) and every character has a nice "bow" (growth or change). By comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" who "bow" are Buzz, who loves to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment about Buzz. There are lots of laughter and sweet moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors are doing great language work, and the animation, both the movement and the details, is outstanding. <br /> <br /> This serious movie lover does not throw around "10", but this movie is certainly worthy of the "10" I've given.
