Without a doubt, this film must be one of the biggest in film history. I've seen it too often to remember, and every time it's like seeing the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest in her career, closely followed by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and nuance of her performance leaves every other Bollywood heroine pale. Her masterful interpretation of Kathak, paired with her grace, her tragic vulnerability, and her poetic tradition of Urdhu, is like nothing you've ever seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; Photography, lavish cinematography and staging are so full of symbolism and meaning that the viewer remains breathless. Naushad's music is second to none, his knowledge of the courtesan music is incredible, and the manner in which he accompanies the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who sincerely enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should pursue this epic mediation life and art.
