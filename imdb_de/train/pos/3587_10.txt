I really like this movie ... When I started to look at it, I thought I was going to get bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I've seen it a few times now. The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (for the first time Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of it, but I agree with another comment that the end is somehow disappointing. I would have loved to change a little! Anyway, good gripping story.
