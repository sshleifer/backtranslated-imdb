Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. Do you know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch ... Thing, I cried, considering I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are well trained. A nice family movie, * not * for completely hardened, non-fluffy people or animal haters, but could be used for Soft-as-Crap a.k.a. People like me are suitable. <br /> <br /> A good movie in total 10/10!
