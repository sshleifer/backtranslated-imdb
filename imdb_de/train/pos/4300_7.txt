This film may have been one of those ordinary "soaps" that relate the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... broken relationships, building new friendships, street battles, nearby accidents, hopes, and Dreams and even the discovery of a baby thrown away under some bushes! What a mix of events! Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond the daily events and asks questions to consider, though there are no satisfying answers. He asks in this chaotic world that things just happen, it's just luck if things turn out right, or if you take a fatalistic view, a person is predestined to be in a certain place at some point in time to be so involved in the event and its future takes on a new perspective? Most of us have had this weird experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super-ego that makes us believe that we are so important? What does a character say? He once sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but a good exploration of human relationships. Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role.
