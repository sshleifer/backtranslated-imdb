I liked almost all the films in the Dirty Harry series, with the exception of those I think is called Enforcer. "Deadpool" was also weak in areas, but I liked it anyway. This is one of my favorites in the series, if not something else for the great line of "Come on, make my day". This also shows an interesting, albeit familiar, act that someone killed those who did it wrong. Just think of "Magnum Force" with fewer puzzles about who's behind the murders, and you have your plan. Granted, there is more than that, as there is a very nice final showdown in an amusement park here. It also shows that Dirty Harry gets a bulldog as a present and triggers Sandra Locke in a pretty humorous scene. The only question left is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his films. She drops the score by one point each time, even though the movie as a whole is pleasing to me. Granted, she's not feeling bad, but her character could have been so much better for someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they almost seem to be advertising for guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining the different strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets they contain? Nevertheless, a very nice introduction to the Dirty Harry film series.
