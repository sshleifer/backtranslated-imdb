This is a better adaptation of the book than Paltrow's (though I liked them too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - both are very good - but the script is better. Davies is a master at tailoring Austen for filming, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not quite as shiny as the Hollywood treatment, but it's in short supply and I thought that the venues and costumes actually work better.
