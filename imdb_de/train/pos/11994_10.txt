For many, I can not help praising the cast and crew that Talespin and others have developed during my childhood. As all those who have commented here, I have enjoyed the quality of the animation not only of the animation but also of the quality of the history lines and the characters. <br /> <br /> To classify this work of art as a "cartoon", it can never do justice to Talespin. In fact, it is an insult to classify it as a "cartoon". Talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is apparently the greatest work of genius, which was produced until today in Disney. When Disney pulled it out of the air, they did not realize what they had done. I'm sure their souls have been tortured by remorse ever since. <br /> I take a moment to explain: From the first, the ducktales, to the last I think of Darkwing Duck, Disney was plagued with failures due to political correctness and has since gone into a quantum leap They prefer quantity over quality, not to mention the space in which Monkeys for whom I can not, that my children watch the startling "cartoons" that they now throw out of the fear that they are all in as Homer Simpson of the future and 50% of the blame would be that I allow that I should not let that happen. That's why I put ALL shows from the late '80s to the mid' 90s on a hard drive so that one day my kids could not be damaged by the "cartoon crap" of Today and to have Savor the last piece of my childhood I can keep and I owe this to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin is without a doubt the best animation ever made in the world. There is depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and lack of really bad qualities and storylines, many of which are today , Do you see any of this content in "Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else you can think of?" The garbage produced today can be compared to the undifferentiated hyroglyph of a three-year-old Picasso. <br /> <br /> The next time you watch an episode of Talespin; Take a look at the wood grain on a wooden object or building like "Higher for Hire" and feel the quality of workmanship and the effort for this animation. Also, the one-shot backgrounds were made as if they were used again and again, "The Buildings" Looks true to the Art Deco movement, which was popular in the time frame shown. Even the vehicles are lifelike. OK, not all episodes were awesome in the animation, but the lower grades were obscured by the superior scenes. At the end of the episode, everything was balanced, and you probably would not notice it at all, unless you were focused and have an eye for it Detail. <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this topic is what I call "intentional mistakes" or "intended mistakes" in each episode and some have two. For example, in Sheepskin Deep, where rebecca says, "You're something with Baloo," and Baloo answers, "Who, Me! I'm as innocent as a student" look in rebecca's eyes, I'll win the rest of the baloopers, but next time just let an eye out the window. <br /> <br /> All the other comments are 100% correct and I have nothing else to add that others have not said here Disney, wake up and smell the coffee. You have slept for over a decade. Stop the garbage and bring back quality in animations. Stop the production of "cartoons". We have seen the evidence of what you can do and we want it back as soon as possible.
