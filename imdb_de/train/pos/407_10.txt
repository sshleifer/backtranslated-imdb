Oh my god ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on a fantastic ride and will not let you go to the very last punch in your face. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and so on. Legend of Zu was beautifully designed, although I did not like some things, they used a lot of stand-up. I wanted to see the real person fight, but well ... a few small disappointments, and I did not really like it until I saw it again when you understood it. I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a real Asian movie to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Go and see it when it comes out in America !!!
