First of all, let me point out that people who criticized this film made some blatant mistakes. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely awesome movie with amazing movie effects. The actors are very credible, the narrative thinking stimulating and the horror and graphic content extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this film. Many questions arise as the audience reveals itself to the strange and crazy creature that forms a habitat in the dark, rat-studded tunnels. How did Craig come about and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie with a great chill factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie that must be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunkers, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch.
