Okay, we have extreme verhoeven violence (though not as extreme as other Verhoeven movies), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but there is something missing ... Oh, yes, the intelligence Paul Verhoeven knows is missing in his Science fiction films. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have enough humor to fall into the comedy genre. Acting was above average compared to most Slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects that would otherwise make a movie so impossible. The crew has really made an invisible man without things like a floating hat hung on piano strings and other practical effects (effects made on the set). The most impressive effect scenes are not visible, while Kevin Bacon is invisible. This is the case when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible male story is more imaginative. Here it mostly takes place in a laboratory. I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or say, stealing something from people's purses or something like that. But what's shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man a fun movie. Note B
