This is a good movie, though people who are unfamiliar with the comics and books of Modesty Blaise find this a little slow and unworkable. For the fan of Modesty, the film is very pleasant, especially because he is very faithful to the "story" of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credits as a "Creative Consultant", and the filmmakers must have really paid attention to him, as the plot follows exactly the details that have been published in the comics over the years, recasting today). The only thing that can disappoint the true fan is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is again just the chronology of Modesty Blaise faithful, as the film plays in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty who actually looks like she looks. A welcome change from the travesty of Monica Vitti's presentation of Modesty.
