I saw this movie for the first time on cable about 5 years ago and could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the plot, the characters, the setting. As for the movie, I would not call that a great movie, but for what it's supposed to be, it's fantastic. It gets its meaning over. The cast is perhaps as good as anyone ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are weird. For those who have not seen it yet, I will give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. However, when her friend is arrested by two policemen who hunted him out of New Jersey, they try to find out what's going on and hell breaks loose. The movie is really a great bank-taper comedy and is similar to a version of Oceans Eleven, a poor man with only four criminals who can not stand, and Montana instead of Las Vegas. All in all, if I want to laugh, I would strongly encourage you to watch this movie.
