Chris Rock plays in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (a remake of 1941's Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and adventures in his life new (albeit temporary) facility. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our main character is a cumbersome young - and very little talented - stand-up comedian. <br /> <br /> It's very funny to see the razor-sharp rock playing a bad comedian. It's like playing Tom Hanks a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater one night without a layman. But every time he tries out his material, he is relieved to be drilled off the stage - so much so that his nickname becomes "Booie." His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger and he drives on the streets to try out more material when BAM! He was hit by a truck. Ok, maybe he was taken out of his body a tenth of a second too soon by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he would still be hit. No dice, it seems that Lance is not due in heaven until 2044. What should I do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not-quite-dead Mr. Barton. The problem is, the body they find is from a greedy, old white man. It turned out that this guy (a Mr. Wellington) owns all sorts of things - he is the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine Lance turning things around. <br /> <br /> But while the wealthy Mr. Wellington is in the body, Lance falls in love with a beautiful hospital worker (Regina King). We men know how hard it is to find a woman with our own body, but try to win one while you're a fat, old white man! And it's even worse if she's not impressed by your money. <br /> <br /> This is Rock's first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he is admirable. There is still a lot of stand-up comedian in him - and if he ever wants to get different roles, he may have to stop putting stand-up routines in the script - but that's not really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his demeanor, his demeanor and his passion - are the motor of this film. He clearly has a lot of fun in the role and seems to want you to enjoy watching him.
