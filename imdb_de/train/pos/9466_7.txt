Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has her own counseling column, which is likely to go into syndication. After the death of his wife, he took the time to raise his daughters. Having had no romance for a long time, he did not feel the need to meet the radiant Marie at a local bookstore in a small town on Rhode Island, by the sea, where he wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his large family. After she liked Marie at first sight, he does not feel much when the beautiful woman appears on the family property. After all, it's the date of Dan's brother Mitch. <br /> <br /> It's clear from the beginning that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we feel what the outcome will be like, we're looking for the fun ride that Peter Hedges wants to give to the director. Mr. Hedges, himself a writer and scriptwriter, has given us two excellent novels, "What's the Food of Gilber Grapes" and "An Ocean in Iowa" and the adorable movie "Pieces of April," which he also conducted. It's just a coincidence that both films deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. In fact, Mr. Carell He is getting better. In many ways it reminds us of Jack Lemmon in his attitude of comedy and serious material. What can you say about Ms. Binoche, a smart actress, and a bright presence in every movie? She's right to make a comedy and convince us of her Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad news is the waste of talent in the picture: John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht and Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do, they only serve as music for the decoration. Dane Cook, brother s brother Mitch, feels better because he can recite more lines than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a delightful movie that will please everyone.
