My name is Heather and I'm the girl whose story is based on this movie. I would like to thank everyone who has seen this movie and liked it. As rude and harsh as some of the things portrayed in this movie, it was not even close to describing how bad things actually were. Not to mention the affect that everything had on my mother and little sister. Thanks again for the great comments everyone had, I really appreciate them very much. Hello everybody! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It's hard to believe that so many years have passed since this movie was filmed. Even harder to believe that people saw it a year ago. For each of you who has experienced the same or a similar situation, please know that there are people in cyberspace who understand exactly how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each one of you.
