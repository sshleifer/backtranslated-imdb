Starring in 1947, this 1947 film was staged and written by Orson Welles (with an Irish Irish accent accent). He also plays the great Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blond hair. So I've been hanging around with Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, and so on, but this was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, she plays the terrified Elsa, who is married to a crippled millionaire, outstanding. Mike (Welles) and Elsa collide. He wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband and partner, crouch and bite, as do the sharks Mike describes as they attack, and his predictions prove to be too true. In this murder mystery follow some twists as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Remember the end of the shootout in The Man with the Golden Weapon, who borrowed heavily in this scene). I was not sure who the killer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish focuses on the sea, it is subtle, sour and spicy, all with great effect. These may not be the best fresh prawns, but frozen prawns from Costco. The spicy sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp if you refuel a healthy, yet filling alternative to more banal dishes. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
