After the first shock, when I knew that Mr. Branagh had the courage to film it, I literally shook with excitement to have this epic in front of me. I was not disappointed. Shakespeare so loyal and so accessible. It blew me away. I always enjoy watching or listening to Branagh, and I was wondering ... is this movie dubbed in other countries? That would be like painting the Mona Lisa with a mustache.
