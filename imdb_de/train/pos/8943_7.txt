The 1960s television series "Bewitched" owes its idea to this film. This is the film Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made immediately after being cast in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessed as this one, but Novak is just as intriguing. <br /> <br /> This was the 10th film by Jack Lemmons, who supported well here and also Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things. Hermione Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good as here at The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This film has a New York City feel of the late 1950s and a cat that is like every cat in every movie a hexing. It is very worth seeing as it is a love story with all the emotions of all, and a bit of magic to boot. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think as it followed this movie, viewers did not rate it as well as it deserved - I am sure glad that Asher saw it, so that the series originated from the 60s. I'm not so happy about what Will Ferrell did on the big screen with it, this movie is way better than that.
