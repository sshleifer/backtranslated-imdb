In the beginning this is from England, so of course I had 98% chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema. I have never heard of this movie. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. Wrong, because the two films are very different. My left foot was a John Ford-like movie, and this is a Chaplin-like movie (not because it's funny, but Chaplin in this great sense of melodrama that brings tears to my eyes.) I was right because 1990's beautiful Daniel Day- Lewis gets a little ugly by playing a crippled person, and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, the very beautiful Bonham-Carter has done exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the best women's games of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look into her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes in the cinema since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent, as seen in many other films. See this, you will not regret it! And also a very good job from Branagh!
