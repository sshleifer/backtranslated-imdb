This movie does it right. As a former USAF Aviation Cadet, I can tell you that this movie has it all. The boredom of the application process. The waiting for word. The joy of acceptance. The concern to make it through the course. The pain of watching his cronies (maybe the best of them) washes away. The fear of paying the ultimate price - the death of flying student aviators. The glory of graduation. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but only a few are selected. We paid for what we would have liked to pay for.
