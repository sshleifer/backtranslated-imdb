A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that evolves into a grandiose, humane sequence of images that goes beyond a mere dramatization of the canvas. This quiet little story will amaze you - if you do not have too many problems with the different Spanish accents, ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and with Marisa Parede's more authentic use of the Iberian Peninsula! Garcíadiego has done a perfect adaptation of the novel: even Grandmaster García Márquez should be proud of her excellent work. And now to Arturo Ripstein, who has so skillfully gathered all the effort into a gemstone, a ruby ​​and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ... El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting for his pension while he continues living in his dilapidated wooden house that lives deep in the Colombian jungle (but filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his gamecock and his wife (in that order?). And that's all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so much more .... This movie is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this poetic piece again as soon as possible. The high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is no easy commercial Hollywood stuff.
