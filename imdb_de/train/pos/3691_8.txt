The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. In this film are some of the most creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast represented. The segments are designed according to the same theme "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. Considering that the approach of the various directors to the subject takes so many forms, it is amazing that we even feel that we still see the same movie. No great effort has been made to make it a comprehensive whole. This buffet has so many great ingredients, I am glad that no one has tried to put them all in a single dish.
