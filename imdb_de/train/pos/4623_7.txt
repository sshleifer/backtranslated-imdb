Despite its rather daring title, this is a light teenage drama. If you are not an old chicken coop you will probably find him sympathetic. However, it is not so good to develop characters or situations smoothly. When you see it, you feel like you've been running back and forth into the kitchen, even though you've been sitting all the time. This is one of those movies that is very much about your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heartbreaker of many, I know, but I've always liked Maddie Corman, who's obscure. Teens get most of the time on the screen without being penetrated by these annoying adults. Is it just me or did most young men look very similar?
