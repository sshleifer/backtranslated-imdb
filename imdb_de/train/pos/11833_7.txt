White Man + Progress + Industrialization = BAD. First Nations + Nature + Animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, the same kind of propaganda has been used in recent days to defend the status quo. now it is used to attack it. However, I think that the film manages to overcome the deceitful politicization because it plays the themes of freedom and originality in a way that appeals to everyone. You can not be on the side of the film that has lost the revisionism of the West as the West was won. But everyone can long for the days when horses in the western plains could run free. (The film also avoids the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there.) Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
