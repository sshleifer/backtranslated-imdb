As someone else has said, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most films are fortunate to have a scene that is perfect, but director Jewison has made a home run every time. The cast had exactly the right setting for the outstanding script, and Dick Hyman's musical settings of opera and other music were perfectly matched. Hard to imagine how they maintained the precise atmosphere during the long film production. The comedy is (mostly) subtle and the camera work reflects every little emotional twist of the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know most of all through his Frank Lorenzo role in All in the Family until I saw him in this movie in the '80s and then Broadway). The luckless loser is just the tip of the game Eisbergs, when it comes to giving this huge cast a big praise. Has Jewison ever written about this movie? <br /> <br /> Would like to read it. It's hard to figure out why the average rating here at IMDb is so low ...
