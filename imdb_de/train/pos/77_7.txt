The movie begins with Vincent Price about to perform as a sorcerer. Halfway through the very successful show, the police come and close it. It seems his old boss had cheated on him of the tricks Price had made - even the ones he had made at home. As a result, Price is rightly killing the bad guy. The problem is that while the audience knew why Price was killed and most likely thought that was a good thing because Price was a bit crazy, he just could not stop at one (like I was Lay's Potato Eating chips) <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a giant circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great storyline changes and exciting action. What you can not say about this movie is that it is boring. It's anything but subtle, but it's fun everywhere and worth a look. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX, I would probably have much preferred THE MAD MAGICIAN and scored an 8 or 9. That's because THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie but he is strongly reminiscent of the previous film (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was taken up again in the conclusion film. Both were created in 3D, both have an action where Price has every reason to kill, but he can not stop once he's done the first, and both are great fun to watch. The biggest differences, and there are few, are that HOUSE OF WAXS was in color and more of a horror movie and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a puzzle. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie AND WAXHOUSE (price only). They are both terrific horror movies of the fifties.
