This is a movie I saw when it first came out, and I've seen it several times in the last few years. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> One thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it spins both work and capitalists alike. Only Sid seems to be out of the ordinary fight, though he is responsible. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning: Do not read on if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, albeit quite plausible. Ask yourself: Could someone carry most of his or her weight in a single fabric chain? It would break almost any support. <br /> <br /> When Sid is cornered in an alley, Sid uses a trash can covered like a knight's shield. Sweet symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day I will get this on DVD.
