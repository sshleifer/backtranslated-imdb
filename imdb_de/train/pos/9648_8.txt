I really liked this movie. The story jumps back and forth and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story and you will wonder what really happened. Since I like this kind of movie, I liked it. I especially like the "dating" scenes between the guys and I got involved in their lives. And of course every movie with a naked Staphane Rideau gets some extra points. ;-)
