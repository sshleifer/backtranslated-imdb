The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa, is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but although Nausicaa was an SF epic, it's more of an action comedy adventure with a rather weak SF premise. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the movie, I thought I would love it. Once again, you marvel at Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to conjure an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation is still not in the league of later Ghibli movies, but slightly better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that a character is drawn in a "Lupinesque" anime style. There are quite a few of them here: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the movie, though I'm not sure why it needs a comic element. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better for him. Still. However, Dola, the pirate leader, is by far the most memorable character in the film (even if it's essentially a female Long John Silver.) Do not be surprised if you're sometimes reminded of "Treasure Planet" and be good at Cloris Leachman voiced in the American dub. <br /> <br /> The English cast is actually good for the most part. Somewhat at half-time, however, something pear-shaped began to be in this film for me. I think the best way I could describe is that the characters are swallowed up in the big story. I will come back to this later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and obviously so many people love it that I feel almost mean to them if I only give it 8 out of 10, but for that the operative word is " admire". It was more impressive than personal influence, and it began to drag over two hours. <br /> <br /> The bottom line for me was this: I really found that none of the characters was important to me. Disney would have gone for the character development so that you really fall in love with it, rather than seeing it as relatively two-dimensional parts that you can move as you stare at the amazing views in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there had been a hard SF in the story to make up for it, but basically there was a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magical crystals. That's where Laputa comes from in my view, and that prevents him from being a potential 10 out of 10 movies. However, one has to admit that Miyazaki was generally Disney in 1986 in front of Disney, considering that her same-year film was the rather grim "Great Mouse Detective". <br /> <br /> Laputa is A good movie is in some ways an amazing movie, and you should definitely see it, but I think it's overrated. I definitely prefer the earlier "Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind". By the way, if you manage to see them in chronological order, watch out for the fox squirrel from Nausicaa that pops up briefly in Laputa.
