I just saw it last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Laemlee, Beverly. This movie received the most applause this evening. Considering that two music videos were opened first, I did not know what to expect as they were very fast and attention grabbing. I was not sure if I would be ready for a short while. But to my surprise, I liked that very much. I thought the lead actor demon guy was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade type. Since then he has become really good! Either that or he got lousy roles or had been urged by the director really hard for this short film. The girl did a good job. I think it's hard, since it was her first performance and was so young. The dad did it well too. There was a lot of really good cg work for a short movie, both for this one and for the short game next to "Mexican Hat" which was nice, but I enjoyed it the most because it had the deepest depth and emotion and I really enjoyed the sign. The other was a very simple story. The story was very illustrative and dark! These were real themes with a more imaginative approach to interest ADD people like me. We do not even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just wish I had seen more of the demon character and started a little less of it, so I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought that the credits were a bit slow. Otherwise, it was neatly told, directed and edited. The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast editing of MTV that's been done on everything today. There will be more of this director and the actor in the future. I'll think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor now, not the Witchblade guy.
