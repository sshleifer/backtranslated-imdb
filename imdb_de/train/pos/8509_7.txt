I hate reading reviews that say, "Do not waste your time, this movie stinks of ice." It still does this reviewer for me, it may have a naive charm. If you like the other "Whistler" movies, you can see them. If you like 40s Noirish movies, you will see them here. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good in my opinion as it was in all previous series entries where Richard Dix was the protagonist. It is much slower and the plot is banal. They have seen the same narrative device used in many other films, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the spectacle is good, as well as the lighting and the dialogue. There is a lack of energy, and you will probably find out exactly what is going on and how it will end up not more than a quarter of the way out. <br /> <br /> The 'Whistler' series is semi-noir, and character, mood, lighting, camera movement and perspective are more important than the story itself. But this film is no noir. It's too easy for that and Hollywood is innocent. Neither Richard Dix's character nor those of his ladies in the previous films had to end well. You did not know it until the end. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend it for at least a single viewing. I've seen it myself at least twice, and enjoyed both times reasonably.
