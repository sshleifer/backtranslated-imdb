This film is definitely one of my favorite movies of its kind. The interplay between respectable and morally incorruptible characters is an ode to chivalry and the code of honor between thieves and policemen. It deals with topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like no other film, and unfortunately none that I can remember since the death of the political in the late 1970s. The sequence is delicious to the essentials. She lives off nothing and leads the viewer into a masterful plot, right and wrong, with no eye-catching eye-catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller genres to keep the audience awake. There are no such scenes available or required. The argument is fluent and honest to the viewer, which is an important advantage in a genre where the tension is often achieved through the audience. No, that can not be ignored. Marble ... Congratulations to the music is to watch a movie and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
