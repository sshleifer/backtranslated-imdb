I expected this movie to be a normal 1930s romance. Boy meets girls, they fall in love, boy loses girls, boy wins them back in the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays the artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrows. He hides from the cops as he breaks into Ruby's (Jean Harlow's) apartment to find her bathed in bubbles. Instant chemistry. It's hard to come by, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is obvious and there are scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls," she is unhappy and begins to believe that Eddie, thanks to her ragged roommate, will never get her Eddie. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast-talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! It is a particularly moving scene in which she plays "her song" on the piano and plays it perfectly. I cried every time for the last fifteen minutes. A really sweet romance.
