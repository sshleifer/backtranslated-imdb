This is one of those rare films, it is charming and captivating, dignified and quirky, a true gift. I think it's a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or a holiday because it reminds you to open up to a broader experience (yup, find the magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrence as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead actor and supporting actor is flawless in this movie. In addition, the costumes, if you are interested in fashion and costumes, made exceptionally well. I just wish they would release it on DVD because I'm wearing my band version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, make sure you look at it without interruptions.
