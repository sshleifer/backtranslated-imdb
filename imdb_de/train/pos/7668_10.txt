I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful. Play the role of the modern wizard until it stops. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped me to inspire a role-playing game that I like very much, Mage: The Awakening. I have shown it at various LARP after-parties and it is always a great success. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff Squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is fast and moves in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, though nothing special, was not all that bad and cheesy in the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
