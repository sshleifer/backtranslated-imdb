This is at the top of my list of the hysterically funniest shows I have ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This shows Izzard as the brilliantly talented comedian he is. What I really like is that he never seems to "stink" the material for his audience. Its timing is impeccable and the routine is connected as a performance piece and not just as a series of gags. Thumbs up.
