It's cheesy, it's scary, it's rough, but that's so much fun. It's beyond the melodramatic moments that are just ridiculous. This movie is fun. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around three female news anchors, for a while in front of mobile phones. They go to a small town to discuss a festival, but they can not get a room for the night. And then they meet Ernest Keller. He's scary on a kind of psycho. And he offers to let her stay at home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as amazing as "The Unseen" that he really wears this movie. The movie is mostly boring, though it's interesting to find out the truth of Ernst's family. <br /> <br /> If you see this cast in these scenes, take a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.
