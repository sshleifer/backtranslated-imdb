I like movies like this for their mind, no pun intended. It's a decent, clean movie about a baseball team falling behind, and a young fan wishing them to win as his fool dad said it was the only way to come back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a fun cast featuring Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as well as the heavenly Herald Al, who takes on the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It makes you smile and really puts you in the sport. <br /> <br /> This is my complaint. The one thing that annoys me somehow are these sports movies that make you an unexpected fan of the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just think it's strange that I should get out of the movie and think that the angels are a strong, cool team, even though my actual base loyalty, as it is, is with the Toronto Blue Jays. It is really interesting. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, it's okay.
