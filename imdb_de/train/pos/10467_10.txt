Unfortunately, this will certainly not happen because of legal issues. Transcripts of Joe Bob's commentary on the films he has aired in Commander B are available on the Internet, but they do not really capture his writhing mission, which was a real shout. Today, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) limits himself to describing the added features of classics like "I Spit On Your Grave" (which some Exploitation fans call the biggest gang rape ever) and Jason X, one of the most cursed Friday the 13th continuation of all time (the series was never the same when she left Paramount). All I could think when they were canceled was, "Damn, where else do I get my abundance of meat, blond jokes, and horror trivia every Saturday night? Do I have to have a life now?" Unfortunately, it does. But in my scary-hungry heart, there is always a place for "monster vision." Long live the drive-in!
