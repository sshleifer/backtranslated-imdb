I remember seeing American Gothic when it aired for the first time. I recently came to mind. All I could remember was the same guy who showed up in Midnight Caller. This is Gary Cole I bought the Complete Series on DVD this week and is still as good as ever. This is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. The reason why I do not watch TV is that it's just garbage, except Derren Brown. All reality TV or soaps like Grease, Big Brother, etc., I'm sick of it, I have the Complete Series of American Gothic for 16 To get Â£ 97 from the Asda website, this is the cheapest one I can find.
