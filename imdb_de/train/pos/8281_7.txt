From the first scene I was very excited. "I can say that will be great!" I thought. Acting was so good, I felt I overheard these people's lives. The music was also extremely disturbing. The conspiracy started with a sudden event and then went on to an irrevocable fate. The build was slow, but I personally love this kind of stuff, as long as the quiet suspense remains on track and is not derailed before it pays off. <br /> <br /> So everything is going well and then the fireworks starts, and before you know it, the credits roll. "WHAT?!!!" Everything that I and my companion could say in the movie night. If you understand the intentions of the director, the blunt end makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the movie, check out the very intriguing and funny interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not say differently was not deducted quite right. <br /> <br /> That could probably have been resolved ten minutes before the climax. In any case, it is too bad. These ten minutes could have made the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write movies or make movies, you should know that creating a story arc with the right timing is a HUGE pain in the butt, and I certainly do not make this review from any kind of pedestal! ) <br /> <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece to me that was abandoned before completion. But hay, every day I would take a jaded masterpiece about overproduced dog feces overcompensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br/> <br /> One more comment. Some of the monster scenes confused me, whether I was scared or laughing. I do not know how to explain it, but Monty Python had an unmistakable feeling about this monster in its more obvious "monster" forms. Although this sounds like a terrible review for a horror movie - I do not know, it somehow went awry for me. I'll never look at antlers like that again! :)
