I saw the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India. I have to say, the movie was really well done and really sent a shiver down my spine. The basic story makes me think about what makes certain addicts go on Go on while others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> But I had the feeling that Diane Keaton was in her best shape ... the scene where she craves and begins to search her home for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is .... That Screenplay is well done, as well as the cinematography and the direction .. and the casting. <br /> <br /> A must see movie ..... for all
