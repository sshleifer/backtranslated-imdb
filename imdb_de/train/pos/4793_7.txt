After seeing this movie, I know that I only know a little bit more about the US. David Lynch is synonymous with shock and weirdness for the sake of weirdness, and indeed, these elements are not missing in The Straight Story. It is, however, in a light that I have not seen before from Lynch. We start with a simple family that lives a quiet life, but ends up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with a depth in their lives that their introduction does not reveal. Particularly moving was the bar scene, in which two veterans of the Second World War informed themselves about the events fifty years ago and their impact on their current life and their emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
