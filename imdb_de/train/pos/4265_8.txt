If you have not seen this obscure little charmer, you should look for him. It is the story of a sad Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) of wartime who is listed with 4-F each time he tries to join a branch of the military. He finds a magical lamp that, of course, contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more than MacMurray and sends him through time to serve in all the wrong times and places, rather than the one he wants. It's sweet, happy, and pure fluff, and you can not help but like it. The actions are similar to a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) in the 50s and 60s turned numerous Disney films, but not together. Needless to say, it ends well for everyone, and the viewer walks away and feels pretty good.
