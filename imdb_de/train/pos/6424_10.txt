As a kid, I remember being nine or ten years old and loving this movie. It was the Bollywood action / comedy movie. It's obviously an imitation of Bad Boys! The whole swapping of identities, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out the window and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes of the film are not revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The movie is really funny and was the great comeback of Amitabh Bachan. Govinda is as always a gem and this is probably his best work so far. It shines as the side kick and the best comedy scenes in Indian cinema delivers. The songs ... The songs are both funny and catchy ............. laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very funny and will make you feel like bathing Make Miah laugh ... his accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki naab re daal" is the best song ........ ...... Hilarious.
