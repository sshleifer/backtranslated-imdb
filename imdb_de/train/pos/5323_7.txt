There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not so important, because what happened to whom and when is still controversial. The blatant freedom in the facts that I believe is when they play with Bruno Koschmidder Kaiserkeller, when they actually played in the Indra and later moved to the Kaiserkeller. I agree with Semprinni20 that the movie War was biased towards Pete Best's version, but if he's the story consultant, then I guess he'll make the decision. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings Pete Best plays say the last word on why he got fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as elaborate a production as the later film "Backbeat", I prefer this film because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterizations. <br /> <br /> There's a lot in the film that's quite extensive - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact he was "queer-bashed" just to find out that the band knew that he was gay the whole time. Little things like the band that goes to a caf√© and orders "cornflakes with milk". My favorite scene, which actually has a few bogies, is where Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar at an audition but can not play it, so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries to fake it but gets caught. That's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth it to see it.
