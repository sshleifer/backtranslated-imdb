The first international success of Peter Weir, THE LAST WAVE, is a mostly effective cooler with a fascinating backstory based on the myth of the Aborigines. Richard Chamberlain performs well as a defense lawyer whose life is increasingly freed from reality while being more deeply involved in a homicide case involving Native Aboriginal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to lead Chamberlin through "Dreamtime," an alternate reality / timeline central to Australian history and tribal habits. The atmosphere is heavy and the plan is deliberately ambiguous. The movie becomes a disquieting finale, somewhat lessened by bad effects, possibly due to budget constraints. Nevertheless, a fascinating film whose overall impression of mystery and fear just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
