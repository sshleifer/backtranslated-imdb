I thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese and his love for the movies. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist working in the cinema today, and I can not recommend it. I was fascinated by the whole thing and you will be too. Just relax and let him take you through his world, you will love it.
