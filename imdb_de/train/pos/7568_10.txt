I saw this last day at the festival and was glad to be in those extra few days. Poetic, moving and, above all, surprisingly funny, in his own strange way. It's so rare that directors work in this style, who can find real strangeness and humor in a hyperrealistic world without being precious or disturbing the balance. Manifested both improvised and fully controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and have found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in that tradition (David Gordon Greene ), You will be really happy. This is a wonderful movie and I hope more people will see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
