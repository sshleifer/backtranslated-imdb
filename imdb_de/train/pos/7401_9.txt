I found it very interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and that of the authors, d. It becomes a story about values ​​and causes the observer to re-evaluate his or her own decisions in life and loyalty to institutions. Surprisingly enough, this was achieved in a gentle, slightly humorous way, which only poses a threat to the status quo in retrospect. I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if I could.
