Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie. I have seen this movie 6 times and still am not getting enough of it. This movie is similar in some ways to Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all Dutch films by Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the biggest directors. I've seen all his movies except showgirls. My mother does not like him so much, but I do not agree. I think all his movies are a ride, especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has made several of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
