Bettie Page was an icon of the oppressed fifties when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol excellently portrays the scandalous Bettie, a little girl from the city with acting ambitions and a great figure. Her acting career went nowhere, but her body brought her to the culmination of fame in an admittedly edge area. Photographed in black and white with color interludes when she left the world of exploitation in New York, this TV movie (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very credible supporting role. The problem is, it's emotionally flat. It is difficult to form a bond with the character, since Bettie is portrayed as rather shallow and naïve in the light of the business in which she worked. The government's government investigations are getting a lot of screen time, slowing the movie down towards the end. But it is definitely worth paying attention to the history of the times, and to the severe repression of the government, which was characteristic of the fifties. 10.7
