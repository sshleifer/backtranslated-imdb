"Show People" is an absolutely adorable silent game by King Vidor and Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems are both in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it to the big screen. Although she is a success in the comedy, she wants to do "art" and then moves to the high arts studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for friends of her friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many dumb-era stars have found cameos in Show People, including Davies herself, with no curly hair and makeup. I'm sure when people saw the movie in 1928, they recognized everyone who performed in the lavish lunch scene. Unfortunately, this is not the case today, even for movie fans. In one part of the film, however, she meets Charlie Chaplin; In another, the author Elinor Glyn is made aware of this, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars appearing in "Show People" include John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was adorable and a lively comedian. It's a shame that William Haines left the movies - he was sweet and full of energy, rightly a huge star in the past. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story told in a funny way. It's also a review of an exciting time in Hollywood's history and includes performances by two wonderful stars.
