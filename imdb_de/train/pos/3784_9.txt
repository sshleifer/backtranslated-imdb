One of the most underrated films I've seen in a long time. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure by Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this movie: First, you'll see a dumb dialogue, a far-fetched plot, a youthful idea. OR .. You see brilliantly downplayed idiots who are back in a situation too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this action and it will be a great blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted go down in history with the same sincerity, only Bill and Ted. This is a tough fence to balance, but if you do not see the movie as a disposable screwball comedy, but as an adventure with two guys who have no business in an adventure, it gets so much more.
