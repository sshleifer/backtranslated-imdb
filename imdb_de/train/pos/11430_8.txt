His subtle themes of affiliation, identity, race relations, and above all, how colonialism harms all parties, transcend the obvious dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of the Protaganist childhood, and the exoticism of their relationship with their "house boy" of their parents, a true human being. she knows.

I urge you to be as brave, strong and aware as La P'tite.
