I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. I highly recommend :) :) I love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real events. I'm really sad that the soap is over, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot, and how things turned out for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long life love. I can not wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you like it all too.
