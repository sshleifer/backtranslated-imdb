Guard à Vue has to be seen several times to understand the negotiation involved. If you are not accustomed to making French films based on conversation and struggle of the mind rather than action, do not try to look at it. You just get bored and confident that French films are not for you. Garde à Vue is a verbal film based mainly on dialogues (and incidentally written by Audiard) and cruelly cuts the veil of apparitions. <br /> <br /> Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be wrongfully accused of being a child murderer instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder, he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he has an eight-year sexual relationship. His wife knows that she is jealous and prefers to be executed (in 1980 there was still a death sentence in France) instead of revealing the "pure and innocent" aspect of his miserable life.
