I recently discovered (May 2008) that this childhood favorite was available on DVD. Although I've seen a lot of high-quality movies since then (late 1970's (1978 I was ten years old)), this three-episode low-budget thing is still strong. <br /> <br /> What's fun is that I've seen it now with my 10-year-old daughter, and she's experiencing exactly what I remember from back then: The scary music (she had to hold my hand, though she did with LotR and Resident Evil), change the eternal theories of who the perpetrator is, and also complain about the theater voices of a time before Norway discovered the difference between stage acting and film acting. <br /> <br /> This is the only good sci-fi movie (or series) made in Norway. And it's still worth watching.
