Okay, the recent story of Star Trek was not good. The next generation faded in the last few seasons, the DS9 remained bold where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started off very badly and did not live up to its promise. When I announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But overall, it was solid trek stuff and a good trump. <br /> <br /> I'll clear the nits out first. The initial topic is boring and I'm not looking forward to reading it regularly, but it does include remote controls. What was really bad was the completely unfounded scene in which my wife was just drifting out of the room. You have to cut that nonsense out. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and moving well. The characters, though still new, seem well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are presented differently than before, with a somewhat threatening theme. I particularly liked the linguist who, as the first Star Trek character, can not be proud of death, but has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to be faithful to the Trek tradition, something that was a significant problem in previous series, though they have plenty of time to teach us things like Shield Shooting, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable Full of time travel stories. Everyone wants to start a pool, how long before the Borg appear? <br /> <br /> All in all, the series has enormous potential. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have a chance to see how things became as they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How did the Federation form and who blamed Earth for it? Why is the Prime Directive so important? If you look at these things instead of spewing out time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "Where no man was before" (not "nobody")
