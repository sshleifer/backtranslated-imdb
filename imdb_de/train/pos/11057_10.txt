I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. By far it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just great ... I just order the DVD (15 episodes). They had no superpowers. They only had superior human capabilities (strength, hearing, vision). The 3 actors were very good in their roles, very credible. There was a good story in every episode. At the time, there were not special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was good and the characters were great. There was no fancy stuff like in other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good stuff.
