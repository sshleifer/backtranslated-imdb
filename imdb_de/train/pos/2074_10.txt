Another great Channel 4 channel, long before that happens. Captivating spectacle of Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember seeing it then, and even then, when I asked around, no one had really heard of it. But it's even harder to find someone who can remember it. Channel 4 may not do its job well enough to drum up the required enthusiasm. Either that or the general public is interested in the TV-vomited Big Brother. I suspect the latter. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of this series. Let's hope the same thing can happen with North Square.
