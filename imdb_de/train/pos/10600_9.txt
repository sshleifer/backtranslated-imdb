This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London, which finds out by unusual circumstances that they are not English, but an extension of the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> Film Features Comedian Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY) and a number of other classic comic actors of the time. <br /> <br /> The story apparently was based on a message at that time, when the Canadian government officially gave "an official European member" a hotel room. The idea actually reminded me of the real case of the Hutt River Province of Western Australia, where a landowner "split up" with the Australian government over a quarrel over wool quota. (The Western Australian or Australian government has never recognized it.) <br /> <br /> This is a great script that plays on many political and economic topics, more like the television program Yes Minister; as well as a great little eccentric character piece.
