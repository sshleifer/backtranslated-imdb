The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too short career in the ARTHUR of 1981, a rough-funny and alternate touching story that generates warm smiles, big tummy chuckles and occasional tears in the right mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "races, plays tennis, caresses women, but he has weekends and he is his own boss." Arthur will inherit $ 750 million when he marries a contaminated society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the spoiled daughter of a covert gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), an waitress / actress from Queens stealing ties for her father's birthday. Moore illuminates the screen in one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his flawless turn as Artur's acid butler and best friend Hobson. There are other fun contributions from Barney Martin than Linda's dad. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthirn's denied grandmother. The film was shot with a keen eye for the comedy by a first-time director named Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died the following year. There was also an unforgettable sequel a few years later, but this instant classic is unmistakable.
