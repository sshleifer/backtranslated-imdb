Did you know that the father of Anthony Kiedis (singer of Red Hot Chili Peppers) plays in this movie? Blackie Dammit, is the father of Anthony.

I thought, "Well, the guy looks kinda like the guy from the movie I saw in the eighties, then I read more and it was said that his dad was an actor who had some small roles. After looking through this page and searching the web, I realized that it really is his dad in the movie, it's funny, because nowhere in the book is it mentioned that he's in this movie, maybe his son was ashamed for his dad's acting work in this film, but he has to, I think his father, Blackie, did a great job on the show.
