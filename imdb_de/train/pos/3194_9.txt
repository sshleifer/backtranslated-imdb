There has never been anything like it, that's for sure. This episodic, seemingly superfluous trilogy actually only makes sense as a whole, so it's not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, Utah's cross-dressing sensation. It's very self-confident a movie about how the filmmaker responds to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an extended and spectacular distortion of guilt and remorse. He tries to atone for his sins - yes, Gary made suicide attempts after the first document was aired - through corrections, comments, and conventions, using such Hollywood narrative standby as the best friend and the defiant happy ending (two different, with (in the Glover version) a meaningful adaptation), which she uses for his own personal purposes. Though thematically a film about gender and difference, the structure ensures it's also a MOVIES movie - but at an unprecedented level of complexity. It's just so busy; By telling and telling this story again, Harris is in the right place three times in a row at the right time and does not miss the opportunity to make something out of it. Immeasurably moving and as deep as the camp always is.
