If only ALL animations were so great. This film is classic because it has two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt for all characters, and the relationship between humans and animals in the movie works perfectly. The nice animation and 3D computer animation did not work better in any other movie. This is a great movie for kids and adults who want the journey of a classic hero. 8 out of 10.
