I admit I have a weakness for alternate stories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY until 12:01. Among these sizes is this little gem. It is quite difficult to get through MR. DESTINY without acknowledging every cast member, from kind-hearted James Belushi to murderous Courtney Cox. This film lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great movie, but it's a nice cheer on a rainy afternoon. It is also a great rental for a good date.
