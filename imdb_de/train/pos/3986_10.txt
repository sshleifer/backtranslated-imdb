I'm a high school sophomore, and I need help and comments from anyone who knows anything about mothers in the movie about the mother. Whether you've been through something similar or just want to comment and help me learn more about this movie, every comment would be very happy. The comments will be used for examination purposes only and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I can use them safely and you could help me get an A! I also study 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole'. So if you have seen these films, I would be happy if you could leave comments on this page. Many Thanks.
