I read a lot of negative reviews about this movie and finally got the chance to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It's a decent thriller, shown from different angles, from an eccentric cast of often-drunk potential killers / suspects, including the late porn king John Holmes. Please read the action summary for the exact details of the plot of the movie. I want to contribute more to a meeting than to a summary. Many reviewers have given this film the lowest value due to violence I really do not see it. MANY Modern Movies Were Worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this film, which often relies on implicit bloodstains rather than brutal killings (the killers featured in this film were eventually carried out with lead pipes). <br /> <br I was intrigued by both halves of the film - the first one showed John Holmes as a hopeless, hungry drug addict and the second half showed his side as a little conspirator in a pointless bloodbath. The film has an excellent acting, even if Dylan McDemorant looks inappropriate in his biker-like personia and the goatbeard personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a fantastic mix of 70s B-side rock and obscure pop spread over a couple of hours in the right places like boogie nights.
