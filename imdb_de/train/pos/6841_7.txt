This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this movie is an upsurge on Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife thinking of an affair. After her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, has rejected an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and sleeps with him. After this point, you better not know what's going on, but there's a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who sees the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective in the case who really does not trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not one of De Palma's best.
