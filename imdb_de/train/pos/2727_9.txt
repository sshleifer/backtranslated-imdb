One of the best True Crime movies ever made, and very true to the book by Truman Capote, who invented the genre "True Crime Novel". Haunting Quincy Jones music score and terrific drama by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson did not become a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and the cut in this film are first class. Rebuilding the killings is frightening, and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, it's even more frightening than having shown the shotgun. The film was shot in the actual Clutter House, which had been sold after the murders to another person. The film is very documentary - in addition to the scenes in the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at gas stations and shops in which the murderers were actually. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a big turnaround as a prosecutor in the short trial bar scene, which is filmed not only in the courtroom, but also some of the real clutter murder jurors who portray themselves as the film's jury. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie that is scary every time you see it.
