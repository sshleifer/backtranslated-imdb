I have not seen the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions that came out of it really stopped me and made me think of another angle with the boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and chic. And the actor is really hot. I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the Rocky movies, really smart. I thought that the chosen theme - overcoming adversity and childhood trauma - is timeless and God knows that many people need it. Bring it on.
