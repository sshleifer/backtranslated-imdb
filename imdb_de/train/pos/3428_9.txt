I saw this movie tonight in New York at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read much about it because I knew I would definitely see it. All in all it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war statements," which in my opinion excluded politics. Above all, the soldiers talked about being aware of toxicity training at the training camp and how difficult it was to return to civilian life. It was really nice to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell how difficult it is not only to survive the war, but to refuse the order to return if it was against personal customs. Do not make mistakes - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it is has not seen it or does not live with the scars of war on its soul.
