Why did I like the show until the last episode? Because of the true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her colleagues had demonstrated that whit, comedy, lighthearted humor, and deep thought could actually co-exist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I could come home from a hard day's work and keep a smile ... I loved it ... and why? It was an inspiration to see how this magical person was so happy to help others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a heroine in my opinion ... even though she was vulnerable in a way that is not so different from our own ... too different; It had powers, wishes, and commands that could be used for good or bad, that could only exist in many of our minds. Most of what we see, have, know, own or even want, can be used for good or ill, and how we define that defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled around the world and in other areas, with these constant and unwavering ideas to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She always learned how to improve her skills to benefit everyone around her. She made mistakes as she lived life and went through various growth directions, while she demonstrated well, her aunts and Salem (the underrated but imperfect hero) to show that you yourself can be noble and gifted by mistake wonderfully. <br /> <br /> On her way she also showed many unselfish, learning and loving actions. If this is not reason enough for 10 stars in this war-torn world, where people are so hostile to each other and do not realize that differences are the spice of life and not a cause for killing ... then I do not know , What is . This show was undoubtedly a journey into a better world and an inspiration to improve ourselves, and a gift that would make us smile ... I've heard from a doctor everything I've mentioned above leads to a healthy "stag" ... and does not we all need that? :)
