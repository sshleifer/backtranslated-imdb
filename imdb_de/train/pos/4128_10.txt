With all the violence on television and in the local news, having a show that has neither violence nor language for adults is entertaining. My children are looking forward to watching us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judge. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We like to learn about the background of the main ingredient, the unique vegetables and the spices. We play at home to guess who the winner will be. <br /> <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment and information. The best part of everything in our busy lives is an hour the family spends together.
