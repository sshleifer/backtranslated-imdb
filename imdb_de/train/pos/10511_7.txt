"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but to paint, to go back and forth with her friends in her carriage, to say hello to the people in the city and everything she does knows, welcome. I think there were no movies, no TV, and the girls had nothing to do but clap. I wish she had read something more. I like Gwyneth and think she is a pretty young woman. She is talented, and in "Emma" one has the privilege of hearing Gwyneth sing. I'm looking forward to seeing "Duets" where to sing. She is brave enough to speak British English to all the native British, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dance in Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film release as she is the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony is laureate Blythe Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). It will hopefully be there for a long time. We happy! I liked Emma and recommend it too. It's one of those old stories that are still true these days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute a puzzle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a mystery, Mr. Knightley, I thought you were overqualified." Miss Bates: "It has left us speechless, quite speechless, I tell you, and we have not stopped talking about it ever since."
