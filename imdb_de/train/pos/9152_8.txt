This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel the end banished this movie from a higher reputation. <br /> <br /> The film is being shot naively. This is clearly done to give the film a cooling sensation - a sense of isolation is made noticeable by this film technique very quickly. <br /> <br /> The cruel characters are very well played and present above all the 'nut box' called Joe. However, the healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my liking - they may seem pathetic, but this is a bit OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the na√Øve camera work smells like "B" movie, and quite normal, but you soon sense the upcoming brutality that is looming.) This is one of the "twisted" movies in After the abrupt and incredibly lazy ending, I was disappointed, I would have given the film a 9 if the ending would match the rest of the movie, but the way it is, it gets so, because of the "weirdness" and the biting scenes earlier in the movie only a 7. <BR> <br /> Give a watch and apologize for the end!
