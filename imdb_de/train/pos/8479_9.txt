Seeing it as a child several times was quite the experience 15 years ago, and now that I've found it again, it still has a movie experience like no other. If risky, this is a great illustration of morale and life education recommended for families with small children. Although still an adult, I was fortunate enough to have learned from it many years ago. Trying to find it today is hard enough. , , But believe me, it's worth it, no matter what your age. Especially for anime fans, this is a good introduction to the filmography of Masami Hata. With stunning artwork and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" is a rewarding experience. While some of the lyrical songs in English are not so spicy, the score is still captivating. But even the voice output is much better than published today. Unfortunately, the RCA Columbia Home Video is out of print in the mid-eighties and to my knowledge has not released a new format, at least in the US. Look hard for it and you will be very satisfied! It's an artful, intense, entertaining and important milestone in Japanese animation.
