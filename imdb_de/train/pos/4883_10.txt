We as a family were so excited about 'The Last of the Blonde Bombshells' that we bought a copy for our home video store. <br /> <br /> The acting is A1 and the cast includes many favorite actors and singers. The topic is unusual and the script well written. The music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. Sketching the story here will spoil the plot, because it's really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. Full marks for this enjoyable and uplifting production, and we sincerely recommend them Who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music.
