Reading the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers either saw no episodes of the show either wholly or by their own volition. The thing with Kerching! is that it's a children's show, so obviously for CHILDREN, as it gets older, it'll be cheesy, forced and probably stupid. I even found a person who said the sets were stupid, but I remember asking myself as an eight-year-old why Taj had Ikea ice cube mold on the wall, and I also wondered if my parents were looking at me let my glue (they had none). Yes, it can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair, but as a children's show, I rate them 10/10. Compared to the stuff that they air in their place today, well, I just want to say, I wish it was sent again. DVD release, anyone?
