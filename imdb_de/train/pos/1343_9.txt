This is not a single Scorsese movie I would put on a list of my favorite movies. But that's the best thing I've been running through my DVD player for about five years. Scorsese's patient explanation of the film's favorite moments and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 DVD pages material. It would have to be a British production because everything about American corporate culture would have trampled on the quiet, methodical, straightforward, content-centric approach. And an American production would have required that he only liked movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone had taken a side of his love for movies. You should love the films you make for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just "me too" votes for "The Godfather", etc. People have no idea what ideas are explored in their favorite movies. If that were the case, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese DOES knows what ideas are explored and that makes him a compelling, dedicated speaker on the subject. I greatly appreciate his articulated, generous interviews during the last decade. On the negative side, Scorsese is best when he's excited to show you an obscure movie, not when he teaches you some didactic about film history. And I wish he picked those three hairs from the bridge of his nose. It is very distracting.
