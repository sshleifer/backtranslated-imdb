There are other reviews here, so I do not have to say how great this is or what it's all about ... My point is: I heard of this movie years ago before it was shown. I can not even remember how, all I know is that it was over the internet. The distributors went under before they were ever hit! I've been making moped for months and complaining. Please note that there is a link to buy this movie on this page. The only highlighted area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista Babelfish for translation. I know it's the PAL format and they did not change the text on the screen to German, and at the beginning there is a little bit of narration synced to German. But as funny and daring as this movie is, it just makes it funnier! If you want to see this movie and have a nearby location that does conversions, it's worth it! It took about twenty dollars to get from Germany to the United States. Trust me, it may mean a lot to you to spend on a movie, but if you're into crazy B-flicks, you'll be spiking money and conversions on the right for your friends!
