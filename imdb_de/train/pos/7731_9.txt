<br /> <br /> "After dark, honey" is a strange mixture of sensuality and stupidity. The movie is slow, very slow, but it needs a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man does a great job), and Rachel Ward is anything but sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the psychological heat, the traces of the past ... The flashback scenes, the humor of Patric's character, become a sexy mystery. I recommend this one reason because it's the sexy boring movie I've ever seen. Check the love scene, it's especially sexy.
