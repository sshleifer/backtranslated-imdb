What a great movie. The idea that nations fight each other with gigantic robots is tricky. The ending is not only fitting, but inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm fascinated by the characters. It is a pity that we have never developed the relationship between Achilles and Athena, apart from a few kisses and Athena's fear of Achille's safety. Her romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
