Despite its inconspicuous release in this country and its obvious disregard in other countries (the "R" rating in the States may not have helped - frankly, just because HBC uses the C word!), This is actually a fine work. The sentimentality occasionally threatens to stifle, but is overcome by playing the two leads. <br /> <br /> It's easy to gossip just because you're a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) and Helena Bonham-Carter like the physical deterioration of MND not quite catch it, but their vocal stretching and reckless emotional drive completely compensate for this. In fact, their performance is almost channeled through their eyes (and which eyes!). This is an intelligent twist on an actress who quickly picks up her reputation as an English rose and acts as a character of some size. The prices must certainly follow, if not, unfortunately for this good performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, it seems, has never done his best in the movie (except possibly "Hamlet") and there his game was watered down the big cast). Here, however, he surpasses his other appearances. He plays a self-abhorrent, unstable, ultimately loveable guy with a subtlety he has not always shown, showing both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him just as much as we can not believe him as Frankenstein as a priest in "The Proposition", as a lawyer in "The Gingerbread Man", as Andrew in "Peter's Friends". This is certainly his best performance so far - why should not he produce the product earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars, it probably would not be enough. But it was a pleasure to see this couple playing their socks that way, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them (though not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
