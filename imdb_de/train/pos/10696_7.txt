Every time I see Nicole, I like her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just will not give up, but she always breaks your heart. The first film I remembered was Of Human Bondage, the Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The cattle over the correctness of the Russian, which is spoken in this film, are petty, it was good enough to deceive me or anyone else who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss the point. The no-goodnik Russian guys were also well-staffed. Finally, I have to give my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else has noticed. He plays a sap with great dignity, and between him and Nicole was definitely some heat. To think guys get PAID for it, mind blowing.
