When it first aired in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our very first VHS recorder. I still have this aging band that I try to watch every year. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back happy memories of happy times, many of which spent hours playing this movie in the background. I finally collapsed this year and ordered a DVD that prompted me to briefly write down this brief reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens is recorded here in an outstanding way. George C. Scott is absolutely incredible and absolutely credible as a Scrooge. The side occupation is just as spectacular. This is a perfect production in my opinion. Small details contribute a lot to the enjoyment. The game "similes" Scrooge's nephew and wife playing with their party guests are a decent item. (I've recreated it since then with my high school English students as a short break from teaching!) Honestly, I can only imagine a few ways to talk about the holidays that I enjoy more than this CBS Originally sponsored by IBM. (By the way, it's fun to see the old band with the original IBM commercials ... showing how much computers have evolved in 21 years, amazing how things have changed!) Conclusion: It's a Christmas carol a timeless story The rendering is a timeless classic. Have fun ... and God bless us all!
