The very name of this movie made me see exactly what it was about, so I recorded this movie in the early hours of the AM. If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through in the early days, and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine breaks down among the men. This film wants to show clearly that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to the French miners much to the disbelief of the French citizens. The actors were all outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a little boy working in the mine. There is an old retired miner who has to go down the mine with a ladder when the lift breaks. If you're a real movie fan, you should not miss this movie.
