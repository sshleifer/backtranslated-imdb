"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story about the young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who escapes her crushing roots to become herself. Although the title character is artfully played by the great Ashley Judd - probably in her first movie role to be quite proud of - the focus is not on becoming "someone," the next Madonna (whether Jesus' mother) or the obtrusive one , attention-seeking singers). <br /> <br /> Instead, it is emphasized that one follows one's own instincts and is thoughtful enough to develop into an ideal, adult self. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! When writing in her journal, a spoken narrative (by Ms. Judd) is occasionally used - and alas, I've just lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful movie that tells us that you can discover bliss - oh, I do not know how he wears water and chops wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / Director / Writer Todd Field, Nick played Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut," co-stars like Ruby Lee's noble love interest, one that helps her heal her notion of relationships were implanted from childhood. <br /> <br /> But even his character is not the answer for Ruby Lee: there is no outer hero forced upon her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / staged "Ulee's Gold," did an amazing job demonstrating that a young woman grew in herself, facing centuries of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> The minor cast is also outstanding, and the music used, especially the samples of Sam Phillips (the wife of T. Bone Burnett), is all about - especially "Trying to be on Earth "When I hear the first chords of this song now, tears come to my eyes, Pavlovian and unbidden - not sure if it's the music or the indelible link to the movie's quiet, charming message. <br /> <This movie is recommended for every young person trying to find their way. For every woman of all ages it is a must! The disadvantage: It is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish. (We've learned, however, that it's legal to make a copy of a VHS version that's easy to find online.) My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and got a DVD copy for me.) Although this sweetheart a movie appears occasionally on air? usually on an indie channel? You can not count on it when you need it the most to relieve the pressure of the world. So, buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a big reissue, and it would be if I was Queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
