This is a cute and sad little story about cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese girl who fled to California to escape a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American worker striving for rock-and-roll aspirations but with little concrete potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken in order to stay in the US permanently, with the understanding that they will live together until she gets a "green card", but the marriage only exists in her name. It soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As an immigration lawyer, I've seen such "arrangements" have their own lives, and I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
