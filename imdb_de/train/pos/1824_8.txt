All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I've always liked. When I was a kid, I looked at it every two days. It is underestimated if you look at the IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie, as many say it is a very good movie. That's good and your children will probably like it. Although classified as G, some parents find it somewhat violent. It's actually a pretty dark story in which the dogs resemble the gangsters involved in gambling, blackmail, and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who fled the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but returns to earth. Many younger children watching this movie may feel like watching a big children's movie. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that could scare little children, but I'm sure they'll do well. Every time I see this movie, it reminds me of my childhood. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds him of when he was younger. This is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last movie featuring a little girl named Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a pity because she had so much potential and did nothing. It deserves what happened. Now that I know her story, I can not watch this movie in the same way because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this film is great, the language work is great and the story is good, but it's a little different from many other children's films. This was very popular at the time of its release, but was overshadowed by Disney's mega-popular The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that is not well understood by adults, but if you're a kid or if you grew up with this movie as a kid, you'll enjoy it.
