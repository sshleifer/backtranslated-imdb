I had to be eleven years old when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must for the whole family, I believe in Sun. Nights Repeated gags were when Rob opened his locker (he had to use a scale or a pointer to gauge the right spot on another locker and do some other things, finally kicking the spot, whereupon his door opened), and needles from a new shirt (at the beginning of an episode he opened a package with a new shirt and for the rest of the show he found one pin after the other, which he missed unpacking the shirt.) The timing was everything and the pins laughed a lot .) I remember an aunt who ran a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted Sonny to say something scientific. He thought about it and came up with "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis, which caused her to say how brilliant he was. (They had to have been there). Every time she was on the screen, Marion Lorne stole the show. Why they did not continue the series out of their POV when Wally left off (he was worried that he was typed, but until then it was way too late), I'll never know. I've seen somewhere that the first TV wedding (big big anyway) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Horsecocky It was Rob and Nancy (I've never had the shit for them), and I remember it made the cover of TV Guide and put all the newspapers and important magazines under pressure. A trip to the New York City Broadcasting Museum a few years ago was disappointing as it had very few episodes at the time and may have disappeared. I still remember as wonderful and wish I had been a bit older.
