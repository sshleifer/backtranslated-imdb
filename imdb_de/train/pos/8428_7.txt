If this had happened earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's good enough, like most of them, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is unusually fascinating: the peasants in the province have two champions, a benevolent chief (by way of exception) and a philosopher samurai who sets up a kind of grange; both are in conflict with the usual local gangsters who want the harvest to fail because they increase their gambling revenue and have a chance of grabbing land; Their supreme or mighty ally is an apparent Puritan, who dies of alcohol and gambling but surrenders secretly to his own perverse appetite. (He also resembles Dracula, as the villains in later Zatoichi movies increasingly tend to do so.) These characters have enough meaning that they deserve to be juxtaposed with Zatoichi, as he was originally drawn but now has he lost many nuances and the changes in some characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man who has killed Zatoichi, need more time than the film must give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes were missing , Apart from that, the film shows the virtues of most others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, creating a vivid, believable and clearly recognizable landscape (their absence in the occasional episode in which the director just misses it) and a technical quality that disguises itself in its nature: the imaginative use of limited quantities, so that their limitations do not seem to exist. And, of course, there's the lead actor, whose presence as well as his performance make everything work. This must be one of the best-preserved series in film history.
