My Tutor Friend is a well-scripted romance comedy that has something similar to My Sassy Girl. There are no kiss / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always necessary in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is of carefree tone, with occasional cartoon CG scenes being inserted into the film. I like the role when Ji-Hoon nearly kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon beat Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and will soon become a father. As he became father, showed up in the next scene, which makes the audience smile. Mao points: 8/10
