This is one of those unfortunate films that had to endure a sadder, unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film in revival form in a local art cinema shortly after being danced in mainstream movie theaters. It certainly deserves a second time (or even a third time). Sandra B. puts it to the limit through the spoken word and accepting well-known songs in this piece (her version of Hank Williams 'I'm so lonely, I could cry' could easily make you cry). Maybe one day the audience will be ready to take this movie a bit more seriously (but not without good-humored laughter). The film moves at a brisk pace (thanks to the beautiful editing), so some viewers do not find it bland and boring. Maybe a revival is currently in preparation.
