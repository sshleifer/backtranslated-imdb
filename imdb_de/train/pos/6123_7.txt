Before commenting on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I was expecting the typical crap, horror and B-movie and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one who not only delivers, but is actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost. I think he has a future as a psychopath in big movies, if he has the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman by a stupid random mix of ridiculous elements. Once this snowman starts to move and kill people, it will be hard not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely retarded, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast is totally over-contributing only adds to the stupidity of the film, but stupidity is the genius. The scene in which the snowman is with the teenager is a true classic in the B-movie, the horror movie fashion. I really hope there's a sequel, and I'm right there to see it on every cable channel. Of course it's just fun to see the first few times and it's not exactly a good movie work, but I just like it when snowmen kill people. I gave him 7 out of 10 points, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
