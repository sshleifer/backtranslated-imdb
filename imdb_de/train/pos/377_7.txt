A distinguished, quietly spoken drama by Steven Spielberg was his first true entry into the genre. Breaking away from his normal adventure / fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> Based on the award winning Pulitzer Prize novel by Alice Walder, it is an arranged marriage of a young girl's need for a brutal, angry farmer and her painful break from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse, and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, she loses herself through continuity and Menno Meyje's confusing script. "The Color Purple" is sometimes hard to follow and tends to be somewhat unpredictable on one or more occasions in the time frame. This gap in the script has cost the viewer the depth and details that are evident in Miss Walker's novel. It's a shame that Maestro Spielberg could not pick and fix these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his ability as a director. <br /> <br /> The performances are consistently strong and Whoopi Goldberg makes a debut - which she has never achieved in terms of acting performance - when the heart broke Celie, who just wants to be loved. Danny Glover gives solid support, although his "Moses" in "Places in the Heart" was a superior turn for him. The outstanding show comes from the unannounced Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the open-minded, struggling black woman whose mind is crushed by a terrible incident with a defiant white upper-class woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a beautiful melodic result and delivered some original blues sounds as well. Michael Kahn's work is solid, as always, while the director of photography, Allen Daviau, shows an outstanding talent for capturing a magnificent southern landscape. <br /> <br /> This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye. Unfortunately, so many unanswered questions remain. Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
