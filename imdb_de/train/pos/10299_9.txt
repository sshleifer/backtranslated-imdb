I'm a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed at my ass during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious films, especially in the Truman Show. This is a cross between his VERY funny and his serious side. He is of course very funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious and he manages to do so with ease. He is really a multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was satisfied with Jennifer Aniston's acting. I think she is more than just a few nice tits and horny ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool god. As far as Steven Carell is concerned, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have to rate this at 9 a very good movie.
