The New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and fades fast; When the movie starts, the last piece of Mr. Caine flopped on Broadway. Caine is fun for TV reporters, and he gets drunk. At the passage of the Long Island Railroad Caine lands in Montauk and not in East Hampton. Finally home, Caine is comforted by the severely dressed woman Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunate heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap," written by young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), a former student of Caine. The couple believes that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit to revive Caines career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set? <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's longtime Broadway hit is not too far from its stage origin, and the cast is fun and twists One thing that did not work (for me) was the end of the curtain, it certainly worked better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a funny movie you can see again over - but in retrospect, the welcome given to Reeve Caine at East Hampton Station should be simplified into a smiling "hello." The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar, and the much-lessened love scene but it was so good, "even a gifted director could not ruin it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19 / 82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
