Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly matched as a middle-class couple who wants to build the house of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, which are torn apart by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many great laughs (though the story is a bit thin) to entertain fans of the stars or the Hollywood comedy style of the late 1940s. A definite highlight is when a contractor goes through all the issues that must have been quite over the top for a 1948 public. Upon leaving, he assures the customer (Grant) that he may be able to achieve a $ 100.00 reduction from the total amount ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
