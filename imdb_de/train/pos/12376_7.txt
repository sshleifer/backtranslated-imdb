With an all-star cast that's so impressive it almost looks like the "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of horror images, "The Sentinel" (1977) is still a pretty scary movie that deals with the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines is busy. In this she plays a model, Alison Parker, who moves into a Brooklyn Heights Brownstone, which (and I do not think I betray too much at this late stage) is very close to the Gate of Hell. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers under much worse conditions than leaking water pipes and occasionally water cartridges, to say the least! In fact, the scene in which Alison encounters her noisy neighbor upstairs is truly scary, and ice water should certainly run down the stream of most viewers. Despite critics' criticisms of Raine's acting ability, I thought it was good to be in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon, and Eli Wallach. The picture builds on a really sinister conclusion, and although some action points are inexplicable, I was more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" puts it, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in jerseys can not be all bad!" By the way, yesterday I went to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to watch the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although it is cut off from its heavy ivy cloak and lacks the blind priest / nun on the roof of the top floor, it looks exactly like this picture. If this house really sits on the entrance to hell, I suppose hell is the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known this for some time!
