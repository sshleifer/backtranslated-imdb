Of the elements that make the best of it, I have to say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene is poisoned and her reaction is really great. I imagine Christine, as a poster implied, tried to hold back the laughter in this scene, but it actually made her even more delicious, as if she was smiling at Shemp's dying person, which highlights the Goon. His look was a great mix of horrible and comedic plaything. Hardly a figure I would meet in a dark alley or anywhere else. I would have liked a bit of a whodunit puzzle, but hey, if a short is so good, who will complain. Not me.
