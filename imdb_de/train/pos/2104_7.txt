Who does not know Largo Winch in the trio France-Belgium-Luxembourg (the three countries in which the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? Eighteen years after the release of the first comic, which itself is an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. After a first - and failed - attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that's what most fans did not get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to customize the comic series. Some essential parts, characters and acts of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of the first class of the comic, I must confess that I was very surprised. The actors are good, as is the scenario, even if it seems too fast. So I recommend this movie to anyone interested in financial / political thrillers, but it's obviously not an alternative to James Bond or the Jason Bourne series as I read them on the internet.
