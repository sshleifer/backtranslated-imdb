Pinjar of Mr Dwivedi is a great movie. It is definitely the most beautiful and beautiful of 2003. There are very good performances. Dwivedi knows what he can gain from Mast Urmila. She is like you have never seen. a really great performance. Along with her is a good actor Manoj Bajpai who has shown Bollywood what he's up to with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in Pakistan before the division. She comes from a Punjabi family living in a small town. She was abducted by a Muslim man as part of a year-long struggle with the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns, since the agreed marriage of urmila is due in a few days. This movie is really a very good movie. The story is solid and offers a fantastic script. All appearances like Lillete Dubey, Isha Koppikar (you will not believe, but she can also perform alongside Jus Dancin on Khallas), Kulbhushan Kharbanda and many more. These sets with pre-arrangement, costumes, cinematography, sound and background notes contribute to the positive points. from the beginning to the end, you keep wondering what's next? This movie is not only worth a look, but deserves to be part of your movie collection. The ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest all of these no-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-chewing-gum-and-no-dil-to-pagal-shark-audiences to see this amazing movie. my rating: 10/10.
