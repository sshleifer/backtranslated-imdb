I chose 10 out of 10 points just because it's the best animated story I've seen in a while. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind every landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting to non-standard artistry. I was surprised. They move beyond the beauty of the screen and immerse themselves in an action that is both timeless and fresh at the same time. Character development is brief, but these toughening moments are exactly what is needed to make the viewer aware of what and why, and how the character came to where he stands. I am impressed with the whole affair and I think that this is a must for the whole family.
