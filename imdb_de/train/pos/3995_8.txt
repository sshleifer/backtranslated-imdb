Kureishi was not blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. The latest adapted travesty, such as Intimacy, has ruined writing. But the mother surpasses all previous incarnations and even surpasses My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes the widow by having a very carnal relationship with the friend of her emotionally frail daughter. The fact that you believe all this is the recognition of the quality of the action and the finite gift of Scripture. And in Daniel Craig, we have a raw, rugged and rugged anti-hero who asks the audience why a young stallion would consider a limp grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film only fails in the weak portrayal of the peripheral characters, but as a study of unimaginable lust he is a winner.
