Together with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my new favorite dramas in fall 2006. <br /> <br /> Great cast all around, but the work of Campbell Scott (the comeback photog) and Hope Davis (recently widow a journalist killed in Iraq). Apart from acting, the writing was fresh and the acting excellent. The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not in the Warner Bros. or any other backlot scene in a studio, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "survivor" and other garbage. Too bad it did not last.
