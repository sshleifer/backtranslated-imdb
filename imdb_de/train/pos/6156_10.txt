This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 21.11.01 I saw the 30th Aniversie of this movie DVD. WOW, I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great, she has an extra 30 min that the original did not have. I did not know that when I started to watch. The movie has done so much more since then. The music they cut out should be left over. You did not see this movie until you saw the full 131-minute version. Many people say that the music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie by heart, every song has its own charm and comes together as a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had stuck the song "Eglantine" in my head for days. As well as "Briny Sea" (the song was intended for marrying poppens, but was cut from the movie). the 10 it really is.
