Given the bad reviews - or car crashes - I feel obsessed with setting up a gear and making a broadcast to earn merit where it is needed and providing a service. I'm not sure people have a license to say it was that bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie has SUSPENSE. This film sustained the tension for me, despite any shortcomings. How many movies can say that? Not even many big ones. Because of the simple premise, you do not know if people will overcome the life-threatening situation that survives the movie. Yes, the suspension was tight, and with some bumps, the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie, it's an action movie. There is no point at which it stops, dissolves, or becomes talkative. It would be hard to make such a movie, always on the move. I only remember duel or speed. The best thing about them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> Trading is not bad: the judge is as good as ever and the others. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. However, the jury is not sure if it is sometimes a bit strange or shining. What seems unrealistic does not have to be that way. Her first judgments are not always correct, but I think the lead actor was right in this film. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly great, especially for a TV movie. Their only failure can be the apparent and apparent slow speed. But we all know what deceptively slow Grand Prix cars can look like. <br /> <br /> I liked that THE BEGINNING said, "inspired by a true story". So you will not go how much is true? They only know that the base is. The usual "based on a true story" makes me think that it should be mostly true. But maybe that's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE: Good idea for the appraiser to propose a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. Only a few inches would be enough. A stunt driver could do this at 100 km / h. Strange that they have not called an auto expert - or car electrician or mechanic - to see if there is a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has turned upside down that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help him to become a resounding success. <br /> <br /> Pic quality is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been knocked out after the baby, but strangely The idea of ​​saving lives was cleverly treated in a joking conversation to hide them. I think we know why. End of the movie The suspension of unbelief went out of the upper window with the baby.
