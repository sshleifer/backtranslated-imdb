For me, some low budget sci-fi is so appealing and nostalgic. As a kid in the 50s that was all. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" with my father in a cinema. It had Marshall Thompson in the lead role and another poor Slob who got the title role. It is also about a failed space mission, in which the astronaut becomes a grizzly murderer. Fear of the good and a lot right out of me. The memory of these heebie jeebies is still alive in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost just a reissue in full, gorgeous color ... the scenes were well lit. I just have to love it the way it is ... a little more than an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that weird music. Bravo!
