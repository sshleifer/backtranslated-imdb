Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, a little hood from Cuba that has become a rich and powerful crime prince in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he has in the world, his balls and his word, and he breaks Not. em for nobody. Begins as a job for the great Cuban trader Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and, together with his longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer), quickly heads up the organization. Soon he has an eye for the sexy wife of the boss Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony in his position, he tries to kill Tony, but without luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. The film has a great supporting role, among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumping gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked policewoman trying to shake Tony and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Thanks to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long promotion and relegation career. You can see that this guy is very talented. The movie looks great. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: the scene in the chic restaurant ("Tell the bad the good night"). the other is the last firefight where Tony shows he still knows how to kick his ass and kill about 20 killers who have invaded his house. This is certainly one of the most impressive finishes of a movie I've ever seen. It's a must for fans of Al Pacino and crime thrillers. For the rest of you it is highly recommended. 10/10
