The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites by Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, which also became a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a sweet, charming masterpiece by Disney. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; That's what I like in a movie, a very good soundtrack, and I love the songs too; My favorite song is the romantic "So This is Love". I love the mice from the movie too, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the story, the little birds have tried in the morning to wake up Cinderella; I love it, too, when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and the birds) dress Cinderella's mother so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia have torn him to pieces.
