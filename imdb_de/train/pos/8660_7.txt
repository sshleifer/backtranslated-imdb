This is a racist film, but to study and enjoy. For the first time, it's a natural inclination to focus on heritage and dad. They have a relaxed, peaceful affair, with her still at home just before graduation, and he retired, waiting for inspiration to do something. The second time you realize how terrible the sister's husband will be of her friends in the Hillbilly Blues Bar. He takes it, it's the right thing these days, and the critical moment passes as if they're talking about the weather. In the same scene, the sister's blues song is a real jerk if you are least sensitive and like this kind of music. Your performance feels like the pinnacle of the story; a blues story in which the good guys are in their element in backwoods, SC. In the meantime, all the white people in the movie are living a seemingly flat, meaningless life that is only suitable for making babies. That's cool as long as you recognize it as fiction.
