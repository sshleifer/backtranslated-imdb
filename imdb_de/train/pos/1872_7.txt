I had not seen the movie in the original release of the theater, and I was happily surprised when the DVD came, as this movie did not have the popularity it deserved. Denzel Washington's directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more seasoned directors. The movie looks very professional. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He brings a different perspective on this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things the movie has is undoubtedly Derek Luke's good performance. He is an actor who will undoubtedly go far with the right guidance. His attitude towards the disturbed young man who has spoken at this point in his life, in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life, is true. His answer is a beautiful portrait of a man in pain, who is basically very good and has so much to give, but no one seems to see that side of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst of his despair Davenport sent, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, if somewhat subdued way. Due to fears in Antwone, he misses the opportunity to open up to this man who wants to help, but because of the limitations in his office, you only have three sessions and then have to lay off his patient. <br /> <Things work as Antwone persuades the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse that Ms. Tate, his foster mother, suffers, is, to say the least, brutal. The attempt of an elderly woman in the household of the Tate to be sexually harassed gives Antwone a bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life, as he has a scar from the shame he carries with him finally love to Cheryl, who is patient enough to let him see through the love that she and the support she gives him to another world. <br /> <br /> The main services are indeed very good. Denzel Washington's dr. Davenport also has its own problems. He is not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can not help himself or his relationship with a worshiping woman. <br /> <br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a good Cheryl. Novella Nelson, an excellent actress, is superbly suited as Mrs. Tate, the abusive foster-mother. The reunion of Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sweet and sentimental, but of course, if one believes that Fisher is finally happy, then one has to accept that part of the movie as well.
