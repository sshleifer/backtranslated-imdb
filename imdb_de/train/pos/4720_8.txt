A nice movie, especially if you like horses, World War II films and the austere Hungarian Plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. Equestrianism is as spectacular as the horse of the main characters in his own training. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. A good "Family Nite" movie. Although there were some violent scenes, it was the National Socialist occupation of Hungary. The indigenous people were very interesting in the way they asserted themselves in the face of the certain death of a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons to hunt Brady. A hauntingly beautiful movie.
