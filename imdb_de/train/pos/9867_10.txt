I saw Ice Age for the first time in the Subiaco movie theaters when it came out back in '02. I was only 13 years old then, but even then I liked it. It had a kind of warmth. <br /> <br /> We've been on video for several years and no matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. This is due to the one element that distinguishes it from any other 3D animations made at that time. The characters do not have a specific home to leave. They are nomads, and that is really refreshing and uplifting to see. <br /> <br /> Also, every single character on the surface seems to be just plain, but they are all really good friends. In addition, all characters have their own charm (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is adorable in his annoying, overly affectionate and naive way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, withdrawn character and so on. <br /> <br /> Another big point of the movie is the beauty of the animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled from clay, giving the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that enhances the feeling of the movie is that gender means little. There are hardly any female characters, but you only notice that when you look at it a couple of times, and even then it has little impact on the way you watch the movie. For that reason, there is no talk of a nuclear family that would be pathetic in an environment like the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and proof of how much effort there was in 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
