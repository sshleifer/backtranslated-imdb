THE ITALIAN is an amazingly successful movie for its time. Amazingly recorded and with lighting effects that are truly sublime. This is an early gem, the REGINALD BARKER pioneering equality of D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince exercised on production is hard to know, but this film still has an extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant fighting for his family in New York is very moving. The topics of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely topical today. The use of close-ups is excellent and the power plant performance of GEORGE BEBAN is electrifying. What we need now is a really good print that has been transferred to DVD so we really appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.
