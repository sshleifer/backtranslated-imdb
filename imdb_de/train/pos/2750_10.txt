This film is not made by the USA. That's why people rent foreign films. It's a great story of how a person, even if left behind, can bring a person to reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with intellectual disabilities suffer in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). As a classic in foreign films, this film has a bittersweet ending, but that just makes it a better movie.
