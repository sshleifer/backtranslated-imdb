This film is about two guys who tried out a sport on-site trying to get 2 the hot chick. BASEketball is becoming a sport nationwide. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the popular captain, but is hated if he loses the NBA to another rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams, Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. When I saw this movie for the first time, I wet my pants, it was so funny. An absolute must for all comedy fans. If you love South Park, you will love it! Maybe not taking care with children, it is a bit inappropriate for little guys. some duds give him 6 1/2 out of ten, I give 11 out of ten. I like Coop, he rocks, I have to go bye. Thank you for reading this
