This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries. Plotting could disappoint the fans of the book (but how many modern readers have read Bleak House without first seeing a movie version? I only know a few). <br /> <br /> I find it rather frightening to see critical reviews of the series clearly written by people who have no idea about the story - did you actually see the show or just have a BBC production? because Gillian Anderson was in the newer version? <br /> <br /> The series captures the mood, tempo, characters and plot drivers (the Dickensian flourishes that are not needed), the history of Turveydrop, the dynamics of the Smallweed family and the extra ones Lawyers - Tangle, Vholes, etc. are very cut-off The only omission I would have liked was the Jellyby incident, but since the first episode is already a bit slow (after the first episode, the tempo is perfect), I can Seeing that she had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jos's death could have been more faithfully done, I can see that Woodcourt was virtually canonized, and he's a bit more human because he does not have that scene, but I think Jos's death is one of the worst parts of the book, and I've missed it, though it always makes me cry. <br /> Theowinthrop actually saw the show HOW he thought that Esther from her T ante and was raised by UNCLE? Who is this uncle? I think someone who might mistake the name DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond is not really a connoisseur of English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also believe that he is misrepresenting the treatment of the law. Yes, the law is very poorly drawn in Bleak House. It is failing the descendants of Jarndyce, whose valuable legacy is being consumed by litigation costs, the late Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and those who believe in the lawsuit are failing. Miss Flyte fails. In a sense, Captain Hawdon fails, too, driven to death by the monotony of the writer's work. Yes, it feeds the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to move beyond their position in life. Although Dickens would not have been friendly to social status climbers, he would have preferred that they would not be stuck in the ward where they were born (Jo and the bricklayer families, trying to free Charley Neckett from poverty). <br /> <br /> Although the law is being abused by Tulkinghorn and the Chancery vultures, it is actually the source of security for the districts of Court Ada and Richard and for Esther, who is simply Jarndyce's station. Her safety was guaranteed by the law she supplies to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can not see that anyone could have trouble following the story - remember that you should not realize that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock's beginning. They should not immediately "get" all connections. Instant gratification just does not happen in Dickens. <br /> <br /> In order to be "clear" through the fog, Gillian Anderson had such a rigorous treatment that I found it impossible to follow him, and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely awesome (overreacting and drama do not make good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they're trying out the Gillian Anderson version). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick is not "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell subplot.
