It's hard for me to attribute the "fair" number of stars to this film, but I chose 8 because of its high production values ​​and the 1968 innovative approach to war film. Also remember that I have not seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Days's Dying must be one of the liveliest anti-war movies ever made. This is achieved simply by portraying in a very realistic manner the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe between 1944 and 1945. No film before this film showed the war on the infantry unit with so many brutal details and all in a cold, dispassionate way that makes the actions speak for themselves. There are no sermons, no sentimentality, no funny reliefs, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters appear as flat, well-known stereotypes. The movie does not make it as "entertainment," though it was obviously not intended to "entertain." It was intended to take you by surprise with the misery and horror of World War II and the modern war in general. This was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, both of whom are far more "observable" films. Here, the shallow and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of actual action and the realistically unpleasant images (including the first vomit on the screen in cinematic history) make the film difficult to sustain, though it lasts only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it's over, a bonus star who has his heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl Foreman's underrated movie "The Victors," an equally condescending but interesting and thought provoking film, The Long Days Dying does not seem to be released on DVD. Why not? Both films have been on the cable several times.
