Best Stephen King movie next to IT, although it's more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This one has everything: <br /> <br /> -a great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a funny cameo by King himself; <br /> <br /> - well dosed horror in an amusing act; <br /> <br /> Great use of music, especially Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk"; nowhere village; <br /> <br /> -lots humor. You can not really be scared, because it is too much fun and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> -sold, but really nice make-up effects that they can not do anymore! A rating of 4.5: I do not really understand it. When was a horror movie the last time as much fun as this one?
