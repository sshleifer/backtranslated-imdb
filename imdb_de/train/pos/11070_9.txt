I have just watched this movie and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating at 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Guy bring together an ab-list movie (ish) and make them such glorious characters, he has given us a movie with a fantastic movie, varied story with a lot of leftover fantasy. <br /> <br /> Far too many people want movies with an action that can be understood and handed out on a plate ... but these are the films that get poor ratings because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
