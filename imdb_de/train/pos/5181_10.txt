Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much, but four things are really remarkable: Sam Raimi's perfect comic timing and the perfect performance as a camp practitioner (?), Alan Arkin's wonderful characterization of the camp owner and above all the camera. The beautiful golden tones of the outdoor scenes draw me into the movie as a sunset on the lake shore draws me into my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and the mood feel very natural and believable. Some critics criticize the lack of a "deeper" script. For me, it's this lack that makes this movie work. The characters and their problems are real and that's why I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the pieces come together to create a whole that feels right.
