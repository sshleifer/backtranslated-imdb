Without even saying a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom"? Even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... my father did not want to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought that Dawn of the Dead was good. It's a bit like Airplane meets (Meat?) Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom. <br /> <br /> And do not forget my headgear <br /> <br /> and Fido in an aloha shirt is just cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, the social commentary is just too much to comment on at all. <br /> <br /> You have to say it really works!
