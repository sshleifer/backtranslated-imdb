Whether it's three boys in their tight white boys knocking on a knotted guy, or a girl saying, "What's up, dog?" For a piece of roadkill there is something for everyone in Knuckleface Jones. It's weird and surreal and overall not a completely traceable yarn. Nevertheless, it never loses you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed ill. And every night I would come home and look at it again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... This is the movie that made me fall in love with Piper Perabo. See it ... before it's too late!
