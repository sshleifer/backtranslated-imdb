This last Dutch-language film by Verhooven made me laugh. As a film fan looking for small details and cross referencing, etc. in any movie, I can assure everyone who is interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses. I have not read a book by Gerard Reves on which the film is based, but I still believe that we get an open image of a somewhat self-styled poet / writer who (in a sense - will not be a havoc here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters with ambiguous intentions like him. In an excellently packed cinematography, Paul Verhopven succeeds in transforming the otherwise rather cute Dutch "sociable (?)" Locations into an exciting film noir environment, an impressive work!
