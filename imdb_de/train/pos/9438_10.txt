This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is an eternal classic. The character played by Ned Beatty goes through one of the largest screen transformations ever seen. He is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance agent. He is proud of his ignorance, and yet he judges the "backward turns" as the ignorant. If he compliments the old man and the old man answers, "You know nothing," the tone is set. This is true. He "really knows nothing". But a rape behind the rape, the man is practically a warrior. His shallow, false courage becomes serious determination. The old self is forever dead, in distant forests, soon under hundreds of feet of water. And what about Lewis, our intrepid leader? Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior, and he's just crazy. Burt Reynolds turned out in 1972 in this film as an actor and devoted himself to this wonderful role. Who would not want to have a friend like Lewis if you were to venture into the dangers of a forgotten / soon to be abandoned world where our hapless travelers are. The story feels real. It works as a complete action / adventure, with wonderful cinematography and targeted grinding movement. It seems like a horror movie, with the danger and almost surrealistic encounter with the common rednecks objectifying their "sow" Ned Beatty. But it also works as an art film that uses incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to the core. I have seen this movie at least fifty times, and every time it appears, I have to watch it. You have to watch it a few times to even grasp it. This is a deep movie. This is a well working movie. And that's a damn story. I gave him 10 out of 10 points and put it in my 10 biggest films ever, including Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver and Sling Blade. Movies that make you think. Movies you need beyond thinking. Movies that use a story without trying to preach. If you think you know liberation, you might, but you might not. It's really that good.
