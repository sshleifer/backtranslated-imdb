All Dogs Go To Heaven plays on the underworld of dogs. The film is a joy for children with a funny and dark, but satisfying and happy ending plot with a lot of singing and dancing. It is the expelled Charlie, a dog criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him, and through this relationship he recognizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I loved as a child through my eyes. I would highly recommend this movie to children. I'm not sure how adults would react. (I tried to watch it on VHS a couple of years ago, but these recordings do not take long, right?)
