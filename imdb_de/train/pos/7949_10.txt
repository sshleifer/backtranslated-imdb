SPOILER'S ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The incredible journey is an important movie from my life, because it's the first movie I saw in my hometown movie theater as a four-year scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel and is one reason why it is not possible to copy it off as a mindless Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The Basic Story: Two dogs and a cat live happily in the Seaver family, when the mother's new husband of the three children gets a job in the city and they temporarily have to move to San Francisco while the animals are be sent to a ranch to live there for a few months. The bonds between the animals and the kids they watch are particularly strong, and Shadow, the Golden Retriever and Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat, are heartbroken as the kids, though the young happy American Bulldog known as Chance a little less worried and somewhat cynical (partly due to his voice declaring that he was abandoned as a puppy, taken into a shelter and bought by the family), though his figure growth throughout history has been a big one Part of the important storytelling. <br /> <br /> The three escorts escape the ranch and enter the vast and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness environment), which is driven by Shadow's sense of direction. They face several dangers along the way, hoping to get them home while the ranch's family and hosts are suddenly concerned about the disappearance of the animals. There are funny moments, a great dialogue between the three animals and funny lines (see - memorable quotes) and a touching camaraderie that grows between the main characters as they narrate, interrupted by moments of sadness (z If Sassy's arrogance crosses a river Without getting wet, causing her to fall into the river and down a waterfall, she leaves a moment of loss that is profoundly experienced by the onlookers. I do not understand what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wild Somehow it seems a bit unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The end boosts the stakes when the shadow falls into a pit at a train station and turns Leg has injured, it is difficult for him to come out and give up, exhausted, followed by chance to climb with him, to climb him to climb to tell him how important he is to him and how he has pushed them so far that he should not throw it away so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (shining) is not completed leaves an ambiguity that continues in the final scene when Chance and Sassy come home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then, when everything seemed lost, he appears slowly and is reunited with the family. The conclusion of Chance at the end speaks of the camaraderie that developed between him and his fellow travelers on the journey, and the realization of what Homeland really is from his long journey until then leaves a beautiful epilogue to show how much his character has grown. but also how the other two are doing. Wait a minute, I think I'll cry ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I did not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I'm not pretending to know where the differences between book and film are Lie. But this is a movie that the whole family can see, and while the little ones will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot better (as I found it when I saw the movie again after several years, without them to see). This movie is a masterpiece in the cinema, and I suggest you go out and get it if you have not seen it yet! <br /> <br /> And please avoid the sequel (see my review on Homeward Bound II!)
