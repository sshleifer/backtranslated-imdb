They filmed this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. There seems to be a party scene where everyone drinks beer (they tell me it's colored water, tasted disgusting and was very hard to swallow over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Nevertheless, none of us heard that the film was released anywhere in any form. It has (obviously) never been released and, as far as I knew, it was never released as a video, and I'm sure it was not released on DVD. However, it looks like it was seen by some people, though it's probably very few. So it has to be something. I would very much like to buy it for my brother, but I can not find it anywhere else. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how this movie can be bought? And what format would that be?
