Okay, there's a front view of a Checker cab, probably a model of the late 1930s. It has the big triangular headlights. There's also a DeSoto cab in this black and white, character-driven, almost musical love story. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is a look at the interior design and fashion of the 1940s and hotel lifts. The hairstyles, male and female, are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she could have made it big. There is an artist loft that every Andy Warhol would-be would envy. <br /> <br /> If you expect this with a great Casablanca act or a Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. In this movie, there is a nice little story under the runway model approach. <br /> <br /> My DVD copy with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was cute, but not Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. This was an RKO movie, but he did not have the beautiful aircraft logo RKO used. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C., as well as Sampson and Delilah and especially on Violent Saturday. See if you can find that. He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers, called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. Richard Carlson made "I Carried Three Lives" on television in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was offered the role of Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. He was allegedly asked if he had any problems playing the role of the father since he was known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I'll play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
