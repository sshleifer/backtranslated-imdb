I was busy tilting the cable channels late at night and hit the movie about 10 minutes after takeoff - every time I thought I'd go to bed. Something told me again and again, I should continue to look at it, even if it was far ahead of me bedtime. <br /> <br /> This film could have been another easy anti-gun movie, but instead they decided to investigate the aftermath of the shooting. And even better, the movie stuck to the real life - just when you get the impression that they are taking the simple and obviously fictitious way, a twist comes and changes the overall perspective of the movie. Not only does this film not follow the formula, it also shows how other events often lead to or influence the later events. <br /> <br /> I just wish the filmmakers had studied the problems around antidepressants more - the children of Columnbine who made the shootings were there for years, and it was scary to watch the way how Deanna saw her every time the nightmares started. Until recently, they have been selling things like sweets and only now are they starting to understand the long term effects of the drugs. It was very refreshing to see that the psychological aspect of the disease made a lot of film. A relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the film was mentally ill in every way. Bravo to the director and writer who has obviously done his homework. And for those who think that certain things could not happen in a hospital (I do not want to give any details), you're totally wrong with that - I was there. The script was so real that it was great. <br /> <br /> Go BUY and show it to your teenagers before it's too late. One day they will thank you for that.
