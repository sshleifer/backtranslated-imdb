I come in. The only reason I ever heard about this DVD was that Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading the few reviews, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an insomniac who is often plagued by conditions that make him doubt the reality and everything in his head. I'm not going to reveal what's going on, but I'll tell you that the film's realism can sometimes be frightening. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic and focuses on the essence of the story, without it to let lose any entertainment or food for thought. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this great movie 9 out of 10, as it goes well beyond what I could think of as a short film.
