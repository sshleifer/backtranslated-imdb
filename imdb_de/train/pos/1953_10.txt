Since this film was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very wealthy, it was just scary how real it really was! The play is what helped make the movie big. Diane Keaton portrayed the main character Patsy McCartle, who had two sons she loved. Their performance is what brought the real story to life on a TV screen. It was very hard to see some scenes because they were so real what happens when you become drug addicted. <br /> <br /> It's just hard to not caring for this very loving mom from cute to sweet but so true. I met people who went through the withdrawal, and it was very similar to what I remember in this movie. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. But it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I can warmly recommend it to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or just wants to know what can happen to you if you become dependent on them.
