Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie that should be watched closely. Some of the funny pieces are done on the side and do not have the usual attention. Keep in mind, for example, how Michael Keaton used the prize-issue weapon in the pet shop ... and also the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of the scene. It's one of those rare movies where humor meets you unexpectedly, even though you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really shrewd here - if you enjoyed her more well-known films (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacations, etc) you should take a look at this movie. > Michael Keaton is very sympathetic in the title role and the minor cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is outstanding. Highly recommended.
