The film begins something like a less hyperkinetic, rather pasty Dead and Alive: Underground activities are performed while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, a Tatsuhito becomes involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> An earlier work by Miike's Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his habits customary in eastern ultraviolet and sadistic sex acts, though it's not one of his more eclectic or extravagant pieces. It's rather a well-made piece of pulp than Tatsuhito digs through the subway, a labyrinth that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells Taiwan's body organs illegally and an almost-young brothel with little boys (one) holds in particular the character who kills the policeman at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother engages himself in the said society, forcing Tatsuhito himself to become a filthy cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to invade this filthy realm is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his nemesis Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China. Later he moved back to Japan and alienated him. Wang is a Chinese man who felt alienated in China, so he killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, which is strange enough, much less than that you actually feel sorry for him when his ultimate showdown comes with Tatsuhito. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when confronted with his inability to control his brother. It would be rude to say that Miike's films are mostly successful with their shock value, but it is true that it is sometimes easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, dispassionate characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
