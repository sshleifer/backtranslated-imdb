Not so many movies have really taken advantage of the fear of visiting a dentist. Those who work in this profession have really intimidating tools. Give shock to the writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch for deriving the maximum shock value in their place. Corbin Bernsen is Alan Feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early. He is an unbalanced forced laborer and begins to deal with thoughts of decay, he can even imagine where there are none, and he equates the decay with corruption of society in general. When he witnessed his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) being with her pool boy, he decides to punish her. At the same time he is under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. Agent (Earl Boen, best known as Dr. Silberman from the "Terminator" franchise) to do a favor when the agent keeps silent about Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to see everyone around him in one way or another, and he goes for a kill-squad as police officer Gibbs (the ever-welcome Ken Foree) grabs his trail. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna klar has a lot of fun with the script. It allows for some really nasty and remarkably entertaining Gore scenes that are as well caring for the victims that they thrill the audience. The script gives the Feinstone character some fine lines of dialogue, and overall is quite crafty and amusing, with big cans of jet-black humor (like Feinstone ordering a victim to "clear his tongue out!"). Brooke and the I.R.S. Agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The make-up effects are pretty good for the most part. And the film does a great job of sustaining its forward thrust as Feinstone, with his relentless pursuit of perfection in record time, switches from a respected pro to a blatant killer. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and worth watching, is more likely to be wasted in a standard detective role, but it's a bit of a joke to watch Boen play his slender baseball part to the limit. Hoffman and Christa Sauls offer very appealing eye candy. Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But that's all very much Bernsen's show, as he inserts his teeth (please excuse me for using that term) into his leading part of the plum with absolute conviction. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is considered one of the more original and interesting horror movies from the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
