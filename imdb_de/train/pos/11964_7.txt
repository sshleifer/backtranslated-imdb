I went to the cinema this afternoon, expecting me to be challenged by Scoop. Fortunately, the movie exceeded expectations at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - and nowhere as good as a number of true Allen masterpieces - but it's also fun as a light, bantering comedy. It's something simple and sweet about it. "Sweet" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they walked out of the house after the show. It does not feel like Allen wanted to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he wants to do a little comedy and enjoy it. Compared to almost everything that Hollywood produces, Allen's stuff tends to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. Nowadays, it is refreshing to go to a movie of a real person.
