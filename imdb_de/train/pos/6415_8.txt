Tllllman Jr.'s drama about the first African-American marine master-diver (Gooding Jr.), who defies all contradictions and achieves his goals despite stern fierce coaches. The script is not bad, sometimes a bit extreme, but the direction and drama are top-notch, and this movie is inspirational and achieves what it's supposed to do. I liked DeNiro in the lead role, although he is not comparable to his masterful work (taxi driver, godfather and all the others). He is as good as his other good achievements like King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. IMDb rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
