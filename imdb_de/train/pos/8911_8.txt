I have seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion films of the 1950s. A strange meteor is landing just outside a small town, and an elderly man is leaving to investigate. A strange jelly-like substance then clings to one of his arms and a young couple, having seen the meteor land in time, take him to the doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the earth. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the crowd is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young couple and accuse them of catching up. After all, they believe them when the mass, which is now huge in the city's cinema, all runs screaming into the street. Then he ties in with the young couple and some others inside a diner. The blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers on it and it freezes, which is its weakness. Then it is transported by air to the frozen waste of the Arctic and disposed of there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This film has a typical frame for its era: teens and a small town. The Blob has a good rock and roll style song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout. <br /> <br /> The sequel, Attention! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988, but this is the best of the blob movies. The cast is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I do not know any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The blob is a must for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
