Eddie Izzard is a genius with his uninterrupted sense of humor. I could listen all day. His unique attitude to life is quite logical. His sense of discovery (like the Heimlich maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laughed so much at someone's indecisive thoughts.
