There are some spectacular, stunningly beautiful photographs from a range of landscapes and animals, from the Arctic to the tropics and everything in between. The camera techniques are diverse and accurate from close-ups to aerial work. The editing is enormous and the commentary is just right, with just the right tone and some dramatic and insightful facts about our world. Where the film falls off a bit is an attempt to capture and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter-hunting interactions in different environments. Eventually everything will be a bit snappy and incoherent. Overall, very worth seeing, especially given the topics covered, but do not expect Oscar material.
