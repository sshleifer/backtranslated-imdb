Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been confused in recent years, from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a television series and a series of games. But virtually none of this has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually disconnected, the TV series was more of a spin-off, and the less said about Verhoeven's movie, the better. However, most do not know that an animated adaptation has already been made in Japan, which was published in the year of Heinlein's death. Believe it or not, despite these differences, this 6-part animated series, in terms of plot, is the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic, the exoskeletal with powered armor that we were robbed of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space, though each of them sees a fair amount. While the events are different than in the book, the feeling of the book's action is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, which is touched only slightly more than in the book. Some believe that dialogue and character interaction are somewhat inferior to the book (it will be a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it is far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political views, unlike the film in which they are reversed, are only cut out. However, the biggest win of the series is the Klendathu Clash between the Soldiers and the Beetles / Aliens, which has the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have liked to see in a movie version. > <br /> Overall, I liked this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein's. And I think they did a pretty good job. If you can find this series, take a look.
