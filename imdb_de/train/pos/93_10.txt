My first child was born in the year this program came out, and I played the albums album for the boys every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives when they start a family ... it becomes invariably their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (probably made on DVD-R of videotapes) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was an excellent copy and it was great to see the show after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and the DVD remain as the best Christmas entertainment in our library.
