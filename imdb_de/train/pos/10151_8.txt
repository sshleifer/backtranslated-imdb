A beautiful postcard from New York. What I liked most was that I could look at it with my whole family and not have to flinch until a stupid toilet joke emerged. That never did. My teens liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I said we could not remember the last time we were able to sit with the kids and enjoy ALL. This movie told a story that felt comfortable, but not old or finished. The end came with a twist that we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and willing to make a story unfold, then this is for you. As a guy, it takes a lot to arouse my interest in romantic films, and he has done so. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
