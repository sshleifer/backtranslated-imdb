I looked at it on an 8-hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and altitude) I actually found it mildly entertaining (emphasis on "mild"). The real idea behind the film was brilliant: one woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with another, she chooses to make sure they do not get together, but eventually she lets it happen. Unfortunately, the actual movie was not so good. OK, there were a few laughs and the actors worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay but not gay friend, part of the story could have worked much better. The talking parrot was a nice idea, but to be honest, it was not really funny. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the movie was more interesting than staring at the square in front of me, but it was close call.
