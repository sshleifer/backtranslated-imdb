I have seen the freebird movie and think it's great! It's a laidback fun as the British movie industry broke something entertaining with time !! It's good, as the guy who met her at the gas station, is mentioned in the news agencies, nice touch. The acting convinced (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some good times that I had in the bike scene. It was nice to see the director get into acting, well done, Jon! In the end, a new harvest is mentioned, in Ireland, this is the foundation for a second film? hope, let her come. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
