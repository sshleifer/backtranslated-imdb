This movie is a great conversation you can see with your wife or girlfriend. There is a lot of laughter and some very interesting little nudist stories. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth seeing in their natural beauty. The beach life of Maslin is full of different nudists and personality types. The Australian coastal landscape is just great to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it could become my sanctuary. I really enjoy this movie and every time I see it I have more fun. I would like to see more of these characters and always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is a bit soft, this movie is of course a great excuse to simply sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin Beach with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
