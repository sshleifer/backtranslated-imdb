Scientists desperately seeking seclusion find a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All of the (pseudo-) science and groundbreaking technology talks of the 1930s are in full swing, including the notion that radioactivity can cure any disease if used properly. When he brings together his rivals who have driven him out of the scientific community and mocked him as a witness to his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course they steal much from Dr. Rukh's original discovery, which gave him only residual credits. In addition, a female weakling, acting as the supporting comedy actor from the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton), literally steals Rukh's young trophy wife (Drake) plunging headlong into this human rage. To have horns like a stag, Dr. Rukh (Karloff) is kinder, so he undertakes a covert revenge mission ... and kills 2 of his enemies and the friendly Dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally succumbed to the deadly radiance that allowed him to avenge himself first, but (to my great dissatisfaction) to spare the adulteress and this poor apology for a human being had married. The acting is mostly good, Karloff & Lugosi are very good. Look at the hysterical chambermaid scene ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, similar to ALL old universal horrors ...
