I have seen this film without knowing it, and found it thematically similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a problematic father-son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father through the mines and dreams of a better life away from home. Both sons are mocked by their classmates and both have a strong female role model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found between the movies was that October Sky was an infinitely interesting and touching movie. Laura Dern plays a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well, as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, which was very different from his other directing talents like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
