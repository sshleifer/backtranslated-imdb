In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, in which the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and strict landlord Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) set strict rules of conduct and Trekovsky feels assaulted by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone in the hospital and makes friends with her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and neighbors are planning a plan that will force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and scary story of paranoia and deception. The story and the process of insanity and loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky are slowly developing in a nightmarish atmosphere due to the cruel situation of his apartment, and what actually happens is completely unpredictable. The performances are fantastic and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
