Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the sympathetic William Haines). The young Peggy arrives in Hollywood in search of fame. Cameo performances show "all the stars in the skies of MGM" in the famous commissariat scene and many details of vintage filmmaking for the scholar. Pic also captures Davies' famous, maliciously sarcastic imitations of the top stars of the day for posterity (her Swanson is a beauty!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy" even catches herself as she meets famous star Marian at tennis, sniffs her nose and says, "Oh, I do not like her!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. Story, directing, authentic charm and a must for all quiet Afficinados.
