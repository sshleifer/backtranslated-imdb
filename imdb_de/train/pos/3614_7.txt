Girlfight is like cooking your grandmother: the same old recipe you've tried a million times, but somehow turned into something fresh and new. Try to explain the story to people who have not yet seen it: A young woman from the wrong side of the racetrack tries to improve her situation by engaging in boxing while dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and their growing vulnerability to a male rival. Watch as they roll their eyes at the series of clichés, and they're right: it's a cliché. However, I was mesmerized by how well this film works, due to the often excellent acting and dialogue and the sensitive orientation that makes it "new". I avoided this in the cinema because it looked like a crap but did not make the same mistake I made. Definitely worth a look.
