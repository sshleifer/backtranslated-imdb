I have to say, this film has given me a double personality. I was told again and again to stop like a normal person. But it's very hard ... no, not the Wang. Was that disgusting and disrespectful? Well, tune in to much more. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show your grandparents, but you should show it to a teenager or an immature man in your workplace. Anyway, back to the voice habits. Fortunately, this site has a Ladies Man (has anyone in the studio noticed that there should be an apostrophe (?) Between the e and s?) So you can always say a fine little word to your boss or the cops. I have a sheet in my wallet.
