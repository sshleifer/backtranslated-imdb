In contrast to the opinions of the other review, this movie was actually surprisingly good! I reluctantly looked at it, expecting it to get boring with clich√©s, obvious jokes, and excessive play, which the trailer had promised. <br /> <br /> After 5 minutes, however, I laughed sincerely and laughed, enjoying the refreshment of acting. With just a 'toilet humor' gag, Over Her Dead Body actually creates realistic, fun scenarios and, without spoiling anything, some of the moments when animals are involved are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The main ingredients of a good movie are all there; Screenwriter, director and actor and compared to some other attempts of romantic comedy, this movie stands tall. Sure, you will not learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you are with an openness, you will probably have a good time!
