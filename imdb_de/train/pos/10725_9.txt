Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time being. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released at the time of the Shuttle disaster, and that was really a hindrance to how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, so ... on a TV ... it just looks average. I remember this scene in the theater. You felt like you were really up there. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie you can see on IMAX, but I'm sure that will never happen.
