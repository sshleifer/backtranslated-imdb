A delightful, gentle comedian, until the last five minutes, degenerating into the mill of the British TV farce. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my rating. Despite this great action and style error, it is worthwhile to look at the role of the actor and the unique Cornwall environment. Many fine little things to enjoy, such as tense eternity that we all go through in order to wait for the bank approval after the clerk stole the credit card ... become piquant if we do not - quite - are sure that the Card is not full.
