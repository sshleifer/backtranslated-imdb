I got into this great program in the fourth season and since then I have seen that all episodes have received all episodes on DVD and are getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. It can not come now over Richard Dean Anderson The addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black has given the show even after 10 seasons even more power and original. Unfortunately, the sci-fi channel has now unleashed this incredible show without hope for a season of 11 seasons. There are two movies that are made directly to DVD movies and hopefully more. Atlantis is still strong in its fourth season. And there's a third spin-off in the works, the Stargate franchise is far from dead. This TV show is a must-have for all science-fiction fans and genres as it offers a wide range of services for all ages and all kinds of people. Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
