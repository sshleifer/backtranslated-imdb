I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was that I'm a big fan of Gackt and a * big * fan of Hyde. I was expecting a good movie with many shots that would please the female eye, but a bit cheesy story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded out there. And now that I've just seen it, I feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heartbreaking performances, and my eyes were still hot from the weeping that lasted in the last half of the movie. They are drawn into the story and in the end really feel the characters. The element of vampirism - which I love, but it's very easy to exaggerate or ruin a movie - is subtly blended into the plot to make it more exotic, normal to that setting, than a random addition to the story , I first ranked 9 out of 10 ... and then I went back and thought about why I did not give the last point. Did not come up with anything. So ten out of ten are. After all - I'm not a big critic - the fact that I write a review at all means that I either really hate the movie or really love it. You can see which side I'm in with Moon Child.
