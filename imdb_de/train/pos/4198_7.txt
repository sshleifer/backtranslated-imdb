From the opening scene in a crowded train stealing a reckless pickpocket (RICHARD WIDMARK) from a lady's handbag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is tirelessly to look at. This is partly because acting is as strong as the rest of the cast, black-and-white photography is crisp and contributes to the virginity of the story and the characters, and because Samuel Fuller's directing him into the same league with the greats as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE ) Huston spiked. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston movie because of a raid that goes awry - but the gain is not quite as strong. JEAN PETERS is excellent, like the hard-edged girl Widmark describes as "a lot of battering." She gives her role of the not-too-smart woman who carries a microfilm in her purse for her boyfriend, RICHARD KILEY, a lot of raw energy and sex appeal, which the FBI already knows. They are on their trail when the theft happens. THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman named "Moe" who buys and sells everything in order to make a profit and ultimately pays for life with her. She is especially touching in her last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This will guarantee your attention by its running time of one hour and twenty minutes. Good Noir from Fox and notable for the achievements of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
