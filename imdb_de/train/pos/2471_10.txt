I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before, but I had a Shakespearean book with me and was able to pursue the dialogue through it. My view of the film may be partially biased, as I had never read the piece before, but I was taken into the grip of this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who ever lived, and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now for the movie ... <br /> <br /> I've found that all the actors in the film have a clear sense for what they said, and therefore formulate it quite well could. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the king. What I liked about it was that it worked very well as a "movie" and not as a theater piece that you are currently studying. You do not have to be wealthy with Shakespeare to relate to whatever the hamlet of Misery has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a broad audience. <br /> <br /> These are my two cents.
