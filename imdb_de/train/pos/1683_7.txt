I saw this movie because it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned Video Nasty 'Blood Rites'. Since Blood Rites was absolutely terrible, I really did not expect much from this movie. But in fact, it seems that garbage director Andy Milligan has surpassed this time, as "Seeds of Sin" trumps Blood Rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of diseased sex slaves in the 60's. The plot is actually quite similar to Blood Rites because we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course; It's about a legacy. The film was shot in black and white and the look and feel reminded me a lot of the trash classic "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is barely a crush, and the director seems to be more focused on sex, with issues such as incest and hatred seeping through. Acting is usually trashy, but most women eventually look nude and despite their bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for these kinds of things, as many of the sequences in this movie are actually pretty beautiful. The chart is paper thin and most of the film is filler. But the music is catchy and the director does surprisingly good work with the sex scenes too, as most are a bit erotic. Overall, this is not a great movie; However, this may appeal to the cult fan and receives a much higher recommendation than the better known and worse 'Blood Rites'.
