This is an old-fashioned, wonderfully entertaining children's movie that is surely the most attractive beginner of all time. Unlike many modern stories that seem to revel in dark witchcraft, it's simply a magical story of hocus-pocus that's cute, carefree and charming of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney kids, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins to be evacuated from the danger of air raids of the city from World War II. They are mistakenly sent to Eglantine Price, a distance education student, to become an apprentice. Eglantine and the children trio use a magic bed button to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's Correspondence School of Witchcraft. Miss Price deals with the processing of spells that are supposed to bring lifeless objects to life. In the meantime, they also have to deal with a dodgy character named Bookman and his partner Swinburne. Angela Lansbury is of course wonderful as an eccentric witch in training, Miss Price, popular. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, the headmaster of the deceased witchcraft school, who has now become a street magician. This actor was previously cast as the father of children in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this movie is a story reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful children's fantasy stories. Maybe this movie does not have such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it does have some nice little tunes. Some were critical, but the movie has great special effects. All in all, the story is charming family entertainment. It is a pity when modern children are too demanding for this beautiful and enchanting story that should appeal to the child in all of us.
