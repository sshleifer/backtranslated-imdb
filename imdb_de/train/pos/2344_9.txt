I'm one of those people who normally watch programs and keep my feelings private about a show. Pushing daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials broadcast, which provided insights into the premise of the show. I was skeptical at first, especially after the final of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Now we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all other episodes. Impressive! At first, I thought it was death and presented in a way that was tasty without being morbid. The characters were captivating and I like the idea that Ned's main character was unable to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her death. Most characters have a longing for things they can not have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive is longing for Ned. Lily and Vivian yearn for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always yearning for the financial rewards of the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and believable. I like how Emerson, who is black, plays the rest of the characters since he plays African American. I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery fans. I just wish the writers would get back to work so the show could evolve.
