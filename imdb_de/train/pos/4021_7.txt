A complex story against the background of the division of Bharat. An honest Muslim kidnapping an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu burning a harvest of a Muslim man - but in the end, you both like it. The story is powerful, but the script and the flow are hesitant. Background music and the songs are outstanding. Next comes a memorable play by veteran Urmila Matondkar. The photograph captures the time, violence and taste of rural Punjab very well. Other actors either did not do well or had no chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. Not crisp, unlike "Earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a trail. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different ends - and all could have been equally good.
