This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie. It was my Friday evening movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this movie for the first time with my aunt Brend and my sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I was in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I've read a lot of comments about why Bud has left Sissy and how Sissy is "learning to trade" married. But let's go back and look at it for a moment: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film, not when I was eight years old, is about Bud & Sissy's relationship, which turns away for the worst because she smiles at Gilley's fool Bull. They get into a big fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then believes that two bugs will have a right, and Wes asks her if she needs help. They're all on the dance floor and behaving like idiots when Bud Pam asks, "When are you going to take me home and rape me?" Pam answers, "Whenever you're ready Cowboy". Bud then goes home with Pam to their home in downtown Houston. What daddy did he buy with his oil money and "all that means". Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he comes home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. Then it's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he's a real "cowboy" and win her back. Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has theirs, I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I got myself a REAL cowboy! I love him too! :)
