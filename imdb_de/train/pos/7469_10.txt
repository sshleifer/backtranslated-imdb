This movie was just awesome. It really got me thinking. I was totally confused throughout the movie. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so twisted and weird that it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenomenal, and nobody could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... it deserves an ocean.
