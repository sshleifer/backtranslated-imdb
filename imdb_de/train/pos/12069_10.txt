Yes, it is flawed - especially if you are interested in Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a purely entertaining or fantasy story, or a plot, and you can not really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films are Insignificance is a perfect example for intelligent film goers. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are brilliant, the story is excellent, but like all of Nic Roeg's films, at every level, you will be able to see aspects of A reality that you have never noticed before. His films always leave you thinking, and I personally like that in a movie. So do not expect to watch this movie and feel happy and happy because you will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
