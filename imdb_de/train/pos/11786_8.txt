That's almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this movie a bit unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. However, I believe that Lynch purposely does so to convey a greater sense of realism, increasing the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical lynch motifs, such as: hovering camera work; haunting music; long (tormenting) breaks; hanging curtains; dark lights that darken at a slow (almost undetectable) speed; extreme close-ups; Issues of women in trouble; exaggerated, impartial, all knowing characters who deal with characters who are desperate, temporarily unperceived, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are great and the short circuit is stimulating. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered, and this ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I just hope he does some short films, more like his Sony Playstation 2 ad. They were inspired.
