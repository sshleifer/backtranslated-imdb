This movie is awful, but that's why you have to see it. I'm not here to discuss the entire movie, just the grandest chase scene ever. As Eddie Tim milk, he is tracked down the hall. Eddie brings obstacles into the Jocksweg with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player, buy the DVD and watch slowly) The best obstacle is a knocked-over mop bucket that jumps over a bridge but slides out a door on the floor. But when it slides, it absorbs speed and resists physics (mainly friction); But what lies behind the door is the highest. The steepest stair case of all schools, which makes this Scot in the air clear. In fact, he would probably die from a broken neck. It not only resists all concepts of reality, but also makes the funniest sound ever made in this situation. Go and buy these. Trust me, this scene is worth your $ 6.
