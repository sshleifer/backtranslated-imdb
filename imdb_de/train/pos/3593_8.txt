Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with an outrageous look and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father, who pays for her brother's boxing lessons. Diana decides that boxing is a good way to put her anger in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch as their feelings about each other are shaped by the square circle.
