Excellent. A grainy and true portrayal of the pioneering life of the ranch in the western plains with a focus on the role and place of the woman. A moving movie, lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget, independent film; never earned money. Certainly not the romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of Pioneer Life.
