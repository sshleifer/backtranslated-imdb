A great movie and a great example of how scary a movie can be without showing the viewer something. There are four stories all about the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various cruel and terrible fates, all linked to an all-round story about a Scotland Yard inspector looking for a missing horror movie star. It begins with a story about a mystery writer whose protagonist becomes a bit too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals obsessed with a waxwork in the museum, then a story about a sweet, angelic little kid that's all other than, and concluding, the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he does to the inspector. It's a beautiful print that really praises the work of director Duffell and what he could achieve on a very low budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee, and you have a movie that you can enjoy again and again. Just do not answer the phone when someone calls from Stoker Real Estate to offer you a bargain on a beautiful home in the English countryside?
