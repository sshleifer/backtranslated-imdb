A thin story with many fine settings. Eye catchers here are the three ladies of the D.R.E.A.M. Team. To a lesser extent, the companion. Traci Lords convincingly plays the female half of a nasty business couple who wants to poison the world with antrax. The original in this film is the Bra bomb, which a detained member of the D.R.E.A.M. team sets up. Of course, she is rescued by a co-member three seconds before the explosion. Although clearly borrowed from James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "They Only Live Twice", such a climax always works well. All in all a nice watch, James Bond was replaced by three Charlie's Angels here.
