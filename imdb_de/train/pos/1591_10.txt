My mother and I are addicted to this show recently and laugh at our butt! I have only seen about 10 episodes and am disappointed that I did not pay attention to this funny series before it was canceled! The story is very funny, the characters have really great personalities (or not great, but they are still funny!). I TiVO every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth as well as all actors never let me look boring! There are some inappropriate languages ​​for children and some sexual content, but with a parent guide nearby you should not have too many problems. There is a kind of "friendship" that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
