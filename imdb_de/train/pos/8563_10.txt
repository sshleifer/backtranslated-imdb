The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (which could be translated as "the most popular among the people"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel similar to the Bible or the story of Hamlet, who is very popular and hard to come by because of her satirical content about the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual humanist, the humanist, in a "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear and sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the biggest Romanian films despite its psychological burden (after all, it is a European film).
