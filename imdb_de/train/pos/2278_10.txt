Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and when I saw that, I expected a big disappointment. Instead, I got a film that perfectly reflects the irony, humor, ranking, and above all, the overwhelming sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly Nolte's best performance so far. He consistently records the defeat and self-confidence of Howard Cambell Jr. from the subtle intonations of his speech to the restrained tears behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely funny as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is stretched in her distance from reality as a young lover of Cambell. John Goodman is unobtrusive and more than effective as Cambell's Blue Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> This Pinnocioesque story, in which Cambell tries to be his own ideal hero and unintentionally become his ideal tragic villager, is a mature and vivid look at what we humans are apart from that it is one the deeply romantic films I've ever encountered. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And with the films that come to a close, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, as his Blue Fairy godmother fulfills his wish. And he realizes that ... well, look at the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother Night is without doubt one of the best movies I have ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep into our emotions and is absolutely true to its original author.
