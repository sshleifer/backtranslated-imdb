The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. It expressed human emotions and was an inspirational story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand, perfect for kids) and was sometimes enjoyable and humorous. There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no experimental feeling that many cinematographers have made today (which, frankly, is a small warning). It was just filmed, but had a nice soft quality. Although the editing could have been better, I thought it would be a nice movie for a family. And the organization of information was just thrown on you, which I did not like, but overall it was a good movie.
