Can I be as simple and primitive in my reviews as simply say "I liked it"? It's pretty funny, it has great stars and it's beautiful to look at. The songs (there are about two that are then repeated) are forgotten, but they receive a healthy, ironic treatment (like the terribly pretty Mr. Fairbanks, who has just entered the raging Wagnerian version of the delicate ballad that Miss Grable has just made , explodes); Not much is danced with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable, and the comedy may be a bit cumbersome, but the result is still very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots that are exciting) is amazing and plays with different nuances of lush, heavy gold. Miss Grable is a bit over her best and on the clumsy side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "old world" comedy. With Rita Hayworth, it's pretty much down to earth, and many do not like it. I think several people would think "That Lady in Hermione" outdated and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale, and they tend to move around a certain paste. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the funny script and all that else this movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released in Germany on DVD with German and English soundtrack.
