After watching this movie months ago, it keeps jumping into my mind, and I feel like I have to buy it or at least see it again, even though I saw it at least 3 times when I rented it at that time /> I fell in love with Hal Hartley's direction many years ago - I've found these films can make me laugh in a place that's rarely entertained. It's a strange feeling and I assume that most people out there just do not understand, or they feel confused and a little uncomfortable - I guess I really understand - it's as if these films were made for me , <br /> <br /> Although I can not remember if I actually laughed out loud in this movie, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. If you do not see the humor of the grocery bag that Fay brings from the street into a church, into her publisher's office, to her son's director's office, you may not have the intelligence to be impressed by this movie. The bag is a silent figure carried around as an icon of motherhood, which the usually brazen Parker Posey must wear before the international intrigue of the rest of the film infests her. <br /> <br /> I think, "Henry Fool" my most unpopular of Hartley's films. I honestly can not remember it well - I think the character himself was so despicable that I found her boring. Hartley's strength seems to be a female character development. Apart from Posey's glamor, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. Her extravagant naivety is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make indignation banal makes his style a deliciously chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film breaks into a highly relevant, international intrigue story that explains the political situations in Afganistan. This is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unique. <br /> <br /> This is the epitome of a "stand-alone" episode. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more secrets are swirling around him, the less you expect his appearance towards the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain smoking device that casts insults on his Islamic terrorist guard, who somehow seems to respect him. It's like finding out Santa is actually a twelve-year-old schoolyard tyrant. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and content with Hartley's other recent films "The Girl of Monday" and "No Such Thing," Fay Grim "goes far beyond what I expected, with humor and originality No Oscar winner would ever dare.
