Three NCOs stationed in India are dispatched to stop the uprising of a tribe of murderers known as Thuggees. One of the NCOs, Cutter, leads the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the water boy of the regiment, returns to the camp for help. The other two NCOs go after him, but are also captured. Now the Major sends a detailed detail to the three, but does not realize that they are running into a trap set up by the Thugees. But it is Gunga Din who saves the day. Well-made Buddy movie, even if it is not politically correct today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe in the title role and Cianelli as Guru very scary. Rating - 10 out of 10.
