I waited a long time for this movie and finally I saw it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I expected too much from this movie and was a bit disappointed. Although I was not the best movie from Korea, it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The theme was nice and the movie keeps you looking without getting bored, even though it's long. However, there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. The acting of Jeon Do-Yeon, however, is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early cinematic history and I think the movie would not be so nice if it was not in the lead role.
