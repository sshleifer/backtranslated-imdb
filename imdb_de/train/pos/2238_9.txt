Since this film is entirely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I had a chance to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (like Scary Movie, lots of scifi spoofs etc.), but this is the best one I've seen so far. I give a 9 out of 10 points. The only reason I can not give a 10 is that there are some little things that could have been done better, and because they did not provide subtitles in any language of the DVD to non-Swiss people.
