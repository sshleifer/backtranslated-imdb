As one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the film without knowing the story before did not affect the movie in any way. The characters have so many complexities that everyone can connect with them in their own way. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions on the lives of the characters, rather than expressing an opinion. You can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
