Well, here's another romantic comedy ... but unlike any other movie in the genre, this is by far the best I've seen in a long time. First, I wanted to see this movie because of Megan Fox and a little bit about Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> If you've seen a fair amount of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Alison would be on and in the movie together, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... Okay, now this movie is just for Simon Pegg. I can not see another actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a much weaker movie if Pegg's great performance were not. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great jokes and jokes in this movie that really made me laugh, courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is fine she does not argue for more than an average act, but she was really good at it), then there's Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox, who plays the naughty, evil star Sophie Maes ... a great one Role for you ... All in all, although I do not usually agree with the ratings on IMDb, I totally agree with them this time. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie, it's really carefree and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My Rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
