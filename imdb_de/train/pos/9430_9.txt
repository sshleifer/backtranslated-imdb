I am a member of a canoe club and can tell you the truth that liberation is in harmony with the peace and quiet of the experience. When we put our boats in the water, banjos sound in the back of the mind. This film is timeless because it philosophically enhances the role of man in nature and the effect of technology on man's relation to nature. We see it in bow fishing. We see it in the homemade tent. There is also the contempt of the urban man and the sense of superiority over the "forest lover". The fact that the banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" should bring him on a par with the lumberjacks who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle for life and death replaces the quotations of the "civilized man" over "The Law." This canoe trip ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately not soon enough for the characters.
