For me, filming and acting is about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a profound tragedy that can be perceived by anyone who reads and understands the biblical accounts. In this movie, I thought the narration of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was best. The story of David and his journey to become, know and understand King of Israel made this story all the more compelling. One sensed his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man, who in his time was greater than life. Susan Hayward's fear, her reluctance, but the obedience to his authority as king, was beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel David's fear when Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in the battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. The sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable. All in all, I think this was one of the best movies of its kind. I rated it at ten.
