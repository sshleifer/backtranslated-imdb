I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, that would definitely be Oliver. This movie is so well done, the characters are well represented, the costumes are pinpoint and the songs are good are great, my favorite is 'Reviewing The Situation' by Ron Moody, which is a brilliant depiction of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he came out in the late '60s, but my sisters spent weeks trying to get along with them singing the bloody songs. Usually, it was like, "Who's going to buy my wonderful roses? I already knew all the songs before I saw the movie, you definitely can not make a new timeless musical." stands for itself. It does not exactly match the book and I do not think it would have worked so well if it had been. I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed when he wrote Oliver to portray poverty in London. the orphanages, the workhouses, and what the poor had to resort to to survive and the film portrays is also very good. Another good reason to watch this movie is Bullseye, the old English Bull Terrier. Notice his long, thin legs. This was bred many years ago from the breed. You must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like this, and it's exactly what an English bull terrier would have looked like in Victorian times. Notice that he has scars on his face. Bill Sykes had probably used it for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of killings in a rat pit. He is definitely a beautiful dog and notices that he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy. Obviously, he does not have his standards by the bit Bill Sykes thought was great musical to watch, if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it in some way, there's something for everyone in this movie.
