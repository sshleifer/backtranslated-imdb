It's just funny, look at it !!! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines, so this is a spoof of werewolf movies of the 50s / 70s. Many satires, some political. Feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less baton. If you like the Naked Guns movies you will like them too (again less slapstick in this one). <br /> <br /> Actually, the humor ranges from mild sexual allusions (inevitable in a teen comedy) to truly poignant socio-political satire. The transformation of the Moon High School from the 50s to the 70s is really funny. The sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe not brilliant, but funny. There are a lot of (histological) tears, starting with the paranoia of the Cold War of the 50s and the inflation of the late 70s.
