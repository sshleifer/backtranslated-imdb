I've always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this movie was available on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra is here one of the most unusual achievements of his career. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Frank in the film's title role, he's the brother of a notorious revolver hunter who's out of town right now. The brother is terrified in the heart of the city, and Frank takes full advantage of it to bully the citizens in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of shop owner Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other armed men arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother and he comes to his city to take power. They humiliate Sinatra and lead him out of the city. Kirk follows him. Sinatra transforms from punk to coward overnight and becomes a man looking for a kind of backbone. It's a well performed performance, almost as good as his Oscar nomination for The Man With a Golden Arm. Too bad for some reason that this has not been seen for years. Two other performances include Keenan Wynn, a former preacher who is a former gunman, who helps Sinatra find what he needs to defend himself against Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad, whom I believe was his career on the screen. He is a villain of unbelievable viciousness, pure evil, incarnate walking and talking on the screen. <br /> <br /> But what I like about Johnny Concho is the highlight of an unforgettable highlight that Conrad and Dark deal with. Let's just say, I think Johnny Concho was MGM's answer to High Noon and a prerequisite for what you do when evil breaks down all laws and order.
