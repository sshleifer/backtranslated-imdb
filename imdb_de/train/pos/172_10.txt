I've seen this movie on Comedy Central a few times. This movie was pretty good. It is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is supposed to marry the King of Ohtar, so that the US can get there an army base to balance the power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also loved the end theme. It gave me great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
