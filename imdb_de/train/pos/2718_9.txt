Last year we were treated to two films about Truman Capote, who wrote the book that made this movie - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that such a movie is made in 1967 cool brutal drama; The status of a movie classic has been enhanced by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Pro, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this movie, has been in so much trouble lately that it may be related to his portrayal of a murderer in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
