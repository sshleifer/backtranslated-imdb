I like ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I have seen many of them. As special efx films are getting more and more under control, you sometimes have to go back in time when the writers and directors really had to create really good ghost stories with their heads to find a real gem. Well, this very rare pilot episode of the Ghost Story television series titled "The New House" was one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Once upon a time in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but have not even been compared since. With all the remake in Hollywood, someone should make this "as is" without special Efx as the original. This episode was really scary. I'm happy to finally find it on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other two ghost stories that came even closer were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". I wish someone would make more ghost stories like this.
