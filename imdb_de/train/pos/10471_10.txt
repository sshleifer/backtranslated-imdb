I enjoyed this movie and still hated because I wanted to help this guy! I'm fifty and have a lot of friends in the music industry ... who are still trying to grow up ... no fans, groupies, money etc ... and they find it hard to adapt to a normal life. .. when they see the new bands etc are in the limelight ... it's almost as if they have to start over ... This movie is a testament to what many of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s do now through ... and there I find the movie sad and depressing. But it shows the life of an old rock star - abandoned and credibly lost. The young girl who arrives in his rundown home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is a woman in a movie you will cheer on. This film is a must for people in their fifties who have seen the rise and fall of bands, people who have known the members and seen them hurt, as old age sneaks and popularity wanes. This is an almost perfect movie ... .sad but in a positive way ... because of the whales. SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SEEN!
