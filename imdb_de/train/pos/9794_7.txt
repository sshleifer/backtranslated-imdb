I thought the movie might be a bit more psychologically psychological, but the action and voice acting was first-rate. The animation was in many scenes strong CG, but very good. This is one of Batman Returns / Forever's films that contain romance and the conflicts of Wayne and Motive for dating. Fans of 007 would love that, and so would the women, a great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and the Penquin was back in its true form, this time without mutated genes! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit of an indigo kid or a future ghost. <br /> <br /> The cast consisted of a soap opera stars, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the speakers. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate that under Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman Vs. Dracula, but I liked the smarter script better than Subzero. 10.7
