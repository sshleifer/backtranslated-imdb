A few years ago, the Navy stayed away from producing "Men of Honor," a film based on the experience of the first black Master Chief diver of service to overcome virulent racism. Always endeavoring to support films that show the best side of the US Navy. Nimitz and two helicopter attack aircraft with supporting land installations completed this gripping story of a young sailor fight with uncontrollable rage. Part of the film was aboard the U.S.S. turned. Belleau wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington's directorial debut, playing as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher, effectively and deeply played by Derek Luke. Fisher is an obviously smart man assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a helicopter platform for front-line attacks. Fisher does not seem to be able to avoid his own attacks being carried out with minimal provocation by his peers. Sent to the MD as part of a potential pre-separation process, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of great neglect and shattering brutality. <br /> <br /> The story evolves cautiously but increasingly as Fisher confides his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, a dedicated sailor named Cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. Fisher reluctantly contradicts the doctor by asking long-paced questions, but he soon realizes that the answers, painful as they may be, seek to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> Although all the main characters are black, this story transcends the race as it ceaselessly displays the evils of exalted religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster care. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a series of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality, but nothing compared to foster-mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), in short but sizzling scenes - if any - that would earn Oscar for brutal brutality. <br /> <br /> Films about the interaction between patients and therapists follow some predictability (all these transference and countertransference matters), but the seriousness of Fisher and his physician / mentor is realistic. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> In the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" in no way plays a service story like "Men of Honor," an excellent movie about racialism against a real person. It's not really a movie about black people either. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to announce in adulthood that the victim is still "standing." Persecutors are growing in size and importance as a brave and strong young man, with the help of a caring physician, asserts his right to a decent life. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that Washington is a Lieutenant Commander, but is addressed as a commander Since all support staff of the Navy were listed in the credits, someone would have told Washington director that his character, like all naval officers under the rank of a commander, as "Mister" is addressed. No big criticism, right? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is in so few cinemas. It deserves a wide distribution. Derek Luke could get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
