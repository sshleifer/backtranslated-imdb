I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who makes extreme efforts to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes that she is on her own. When one day at home alone the stranger enters her house and attacks her again. Since she is not about to call the police or bring him out, she has to spray him in the eye and be locked up in the country. They are too easy for these criminals. It's time for tougher penalties.
