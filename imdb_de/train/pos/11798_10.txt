I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely full of entertainment !!! Powers Boothe offers an outstanding performance. As a fan of actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought that an actor could capture the "intensity" of Shatner and Liebmann in these roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones saw ! As for me, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie shows its best performance !!!
