I saw this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. This was before the days of television, so a movie of this size could send a boy into orbit. It impressed me so much that I saw this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at that time were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as was Rex Ingram as a genius. After the movie left the city, I sang for months, "I want to be a sailor". I would recommend this movie to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as vicious as you ever wanted. Even June Duprez was never more beautiful than in this picture. The color was excellent. Give this movie an AAA!
