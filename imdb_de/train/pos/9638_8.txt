This movie was more of a masculinity passage for a gay man and how he has to deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister hurts, his older sister accepts something. The relationship looks good with his friend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try to live with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy turns around and says it really does not mean anything. Our young gay man goes into the corner and lands in the dustbin, finally leaves, drops his new lover and starts over. We stay with him, start from the beginning and watch, do not participate in happiness. Maybe it will work better for him in the future. The end was a bit of a downer, but the whole movie was totally realistic and so I'll forget this real end with a high rating.
