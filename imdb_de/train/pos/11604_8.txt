With the seemingly endless pursuit of well-made, well-made horror movies, finding a movie that even comes to a point where it's almost approaching is all too rare. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled on "Burned at the Stake" in a US cable network while mirroring the channels. The premise is pretty simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the loudest witness against alleged witches and makes unfounded allegations against anyone who deserves their displeasure. Reverend Parris (Peters), who manipulates them for his own purposes, also serves as the leader of the court in matters of witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (from 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift), begins unusual visions shortly before her visit to the Salem Witch Museum. A stranger in the 17th century robes tries to approach her and the building. He continues to pursue them, while strange phenomena increasingly involve them. Soon it seems she's obsessed with the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the rest of the description is somewhat involved and would betray too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and is likely to be of interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the 17th-century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very compelling. Production values ​​are solid except for possible special effects. The film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Spectators who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, yet restrained horror movie will appreciate this. The author / director, Bert Gordon, has a long career in horror and sci-fi filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and related works years ago.
