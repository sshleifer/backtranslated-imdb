I only hear how bad the animation is. It may not be comparable to what everyone expects, but look at it that way. Would you expect perfection in hell? I think the animation was deliberately dry and grainy. It was great to see her character change in this movie, as he will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get. I hope for a sequel very soon. If we want live action, I think we might be better off with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think that Lady Death would be well translated to film. But anyway, it's my personal belief that all the naysayers in this movie are absolutely wrong. No pun intended.
