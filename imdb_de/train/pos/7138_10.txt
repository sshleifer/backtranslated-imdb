If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or "The Sweeney" and other productions, he would have been remembered for this memorable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> This adaptation of the charming novel by Michelle Magorian is an outstanding monument to his art, which is superbly supported by an equally great performance by his co-star (the young Nick Robinson in his first role) and an unobtrusive one Occupation. <br /> <br /> When I read this story about an old widowed Norfolk compatriot who had to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the flash, I found a rather obvious time flaw in it, and the creators of this film have to apologize for that error. They also need to be applauded for not over-sentimentalizing the story and preventing something from easily turning into a messy mess. <br /> <br /> If you keep a CD or video library, it feels good Made for TV movie is an absolute must.
