Like many people here, I started testing my patience with this movie. In the end, I actually shed some tears. <br /> <br /> It seems to be in the nature of most old movies to stretch 7/8 and then catch fire right at the end. Older moviegoers have learned to lay their time patiently through the slow parts, reassured in the knowledge that the big reward is on the way. That is not quite true. For past listeners, see what the "slow parts" were for us the main part of the story. They observed and found there an anecdotal and thematic interest. The modern public, after Spielberg, is constantly waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when older films are seen. It is the inflation problem of modern films. Well, that will not happen. It is not necessary to apologize for these films. It's just that you have to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you look at them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is like the difference between Euripides and a wandering production of Rent. Think about it for a minute or two. Not to burden the obvious, but Euripides still deserves a hearing. <br /> <br /> The "exciting part" for most modern audiences starts with the IRA tribal scene and escalates to the last few minutes, when you are on board or even paying attention, you will have the heart tear. It is not a universal abstract plea for forgiveness; It is a request from a fool and those who are sorry for the big Lummos, for a little mercy. It's so personal and this embarrassingly naked appeal. Because, after being angry at Gypo, upset with him and thinking that this is the dumbest character of all time, you finally find the scene where Gypo's former girlfriend implores another woman who wants to persuade her husband to give him something To do good. <br /> <br /> The film may be sentimental, but the sentimentality is not cheap as some have been charged here. There is a question of life and death going on out here, and as long as you take a customer's life seriously, it is the sentimentality that is taken out of the gravest. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. And the mistake, because it's not 10 out of 10, is up to you, and to some degree, when you read this. We have all demanded more, more and more, faster, faster and faster, until in 1935 - actually only yesterday - we could not sit down as easily as we should.
