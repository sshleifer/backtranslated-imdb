An excellent document feeder. Personally, I remember growing up in NYC in the early '80s. This movie is for everyone who was not there during this time. This shows that the African American Gay Underclass was true only for her and her love and camadry. The people are real and unfortunately only a few live as this is written. The balls are still held, but not as they were in the 1980s. This time is over forever. This is a good "Homo Thug" movie. When Queens were really proud to be extroverted. Goodbye to Storyville, this is another era, but all the hail movies are documented!
