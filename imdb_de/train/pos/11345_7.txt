That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This horrible movie (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 70s. <br /> <br /> A boy travels on a magical journey to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon who looks to me more like a newt with conjunctivitis, and a magical speaking flute are being attacked by a witch. <br /> <br /> The flute is found on an "interesting" witch convention, with the witches having a gay old time. The boy then dresses as a "fairy" to regain the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
