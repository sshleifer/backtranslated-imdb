Now and then the conversation becomes "favorite movies". I will mention Titanic, and at least a few people will giggle. I do not care because I know that five years ago the same people were moved to tears by this movie. And now they are too embarrassed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I watched the Titanic again for the first time in a long time. I expect to be able to enjoy the story again, and I was surprised to learn that the movie has lost none of its power in those five years. I cried again .... in all places. It brought me back to the year 1997, when I can remember that a movie that nobody thought would break was even the most popular movie of all time. A movie that has broken into public consciousness (yes, even more than Star Wars) like no other movie I can remember. And today, many people do not even admit that they enjoyed it. Guys, let's clarify something - you do not look cool if you make this movie bad. You look like a cynic without touch. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this one has some bugs. Part of the dialogue falls flat and part of the plot that surrounds the two lovers gets a bit too neat. None of this, however, is so distracting that it ruins the movie. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him just a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie was really her and she held him together beautifully. James Cameron did what many thought was impossible by modeling a fully believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were terrible, just like that night. How anyone can say that the effects were bad, does not exceed me. I was completely fixated. <br /> <br /> This movie is a memorable scene after another. Titanic leaves the harbor in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, straight ahead!" The screws are incredibly hanging out of the ocean. The cries of the condemned after she had gone down. And this end that brought tears to even the lost man in the theater. <br /> <br /> The music, which also fell victim to the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner was just perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad that the pop song version of Celine Dion had to destroy so many this great piece of music for so many. I admit, I'm a Titanic fan. So I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship as we never saw it - in all its beauty. Maybe it has affected me more than a few, because I was so interested in the ship. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic fans. I welcome Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never lessened the tragedy. The movie was filmed with such a humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it was better than I ever could: open your heart to the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
