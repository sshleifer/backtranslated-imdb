The playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had after a big hit a series of flop games. He receives a piece written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he'll kill for it. He will? <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinking man. It was originally a play ... and it shows. It's mostly on a set and everyone talks, but I was never bored. It is very well written with many twists and a good cast that works with full power. Like Br√ºhl, Caine is just great - another of his great achievements. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I've never thought much of him as an actor, but he's really good at that role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a signed role as Bruhl's wife. Irene Worth is also good (and pretty funny) as Helga ten Drop, a clairvoyant. But her accent got on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet is very good with his one-set. The camera is constantly moving and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths, and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses I've ever seen - but these are mild complaints. <br /> <br /> Very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and seem to have completely disappeared since the 1982 premiere. That's too bad - it deserves more.
