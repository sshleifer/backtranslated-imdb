I love Paul McCartney. He is the greatest of all times, in my opinion. However, I could not afford a ticket to his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the USA tour. I was upset, to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I will enjoy it for many more years. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I would like to hear everyone from Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Paul is not dead either. <br /> <br /> The biggest single DVD of all time. *** out *****.
