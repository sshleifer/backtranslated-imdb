Impressive! this is a good movie! Acting was not good at all, but if you look at a few moments in the movie, rewind and look at it again, it's awesome! The man at the beginning of the film goes with his suitcase against a three. WOW! I never expected that. Then he puts the Coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet the smoking guy against those three was one of his colleagues who later sold the drugs. And the genius quotes: '' beautiful sunglasses, I need a pair '' '' '...' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' ' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' ''. And the fights are the best I've seen in a long time. Look at the second man he shelters after beating the first man's head against the table. What a hit! And in the middle of the movie, a man in a car that was once shot, 3 men fall, he can really aim well. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walked up and down the stairs for 5 minutes and Jason Peters shot his deflections. Jason Peters falls down and turns around once he's dead! I can not say in more words how great this movie is!
