Just kidding. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is looking for greener pastures in New York City. He's the young Optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions, and very soon Joe is the target of both the New Yorker's cold and the disadvantages of his mugger. Because of his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and later moves into his wreck of his apartment, and the two literally fight for survival. <br /> <br /> During the Midnight Comedy is called a drama, it is best described in my opinion as a tragic comedy or comedic tragedy. It is, above all, a beautiful film that stylishly captures the contemporary hippie flair of the late 1960s with its compulsory dizzying Warhol party films and juxtaposes it with urban New York City. The film stops cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, highlighting his position outside the field. We feel that his fight is adjusting, but also to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. Midnight Cowboy has brought tears to my eyes because it is also rich in substance and produces a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired Forest Gump with his pure heart as well as the inappropriate main character and, to some extent, the Crocodile Dundee films, since it is almost the same humor - a contrast between cowboys and sleek New York cosmopolitans. Very convincing and sensationally creative film, which I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
