Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", Sergio Leone's remake of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (proposed by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This is strictly a B-movie; In that sense it is quite pleasant. The direction is crisp, the spectacle full of verve, the limitations of the "direct-on-video" photography are well processed. <br /> <br /> The film's weakness lies in the catastrophic decision to marry the "Faust" / 'yojimbo' plot to a signing by Leones 'Once upon a time in the West'. Although Leone directed both "Fistful" and "West," his motivations for the two films could no longer be different. The 'man without a name' (Eastwood) is a social border path with a soft spot for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters did not have much to do with each other. To bring them together, 'Gun Crazy' has to twist and complicate its action until we lose track of which story we are actually following. <br /> <br /> But that's a B-movie. and filled with action and stupidity; It's entertaining at this level, just do not expect anything more.
