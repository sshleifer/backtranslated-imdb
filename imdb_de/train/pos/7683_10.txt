I loved good times with the rest of you. I love to read SMART and INSIGHTFUL comments. The authors of this show were fantastic and the actors were more than just TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the best commentary on the other superior and positive comments) ... What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a truck accident or a car crash) and it was the saddest episode (When it first aired and I was a tiny thing ... it was so sad for me ...). <br /> <br /> Florida and the kids are actually coming out of the projects and will also be neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the very last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL children have reached their dreams and found an opportunity in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for her and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in her fate. I hope that this kind of ending is indeed true for many. <br /> <br /> This was followed by a great show and many other great shows, including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was a great time for African American television and the best writers at the time were great. TV LAND is awesome for the memories and I just LOVE it because I can not stand the garbage we see today. SOMEONE ... bring you back in the 70s and 80s ... your intelligent viewers are dying here and we need better material. Liebe, a TV LAND original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... those were the days ......
