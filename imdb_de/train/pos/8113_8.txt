This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors slaughtered it after its opening in 1936. Visually, it's a miracle, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. We always make a lot of high-minded messages. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, act like a fanatic. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomaniac. The prediction of World War II was very scary, considering that the world was the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I am sure that the war did not develop as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning montage sequences that bridge the time jumps between the various episodes of the movie. Although not as entertaining as I had hoped, this movie will remain in your memory for a long time after you've seen it.
