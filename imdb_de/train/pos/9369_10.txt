This film is proof that Film Noire is a persevering style worth living. For me it's the best example of Film Noire since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it will never receive the recognition it deserves. It was never advertised properly when it was first released, and it had to build its cadre circle through venues like Vanguard Cinema and word of mouth rentals Entertainment rented this movie and delved into its intricate plot.
