Los Angeles TV reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (the appealingly spooky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young, who is not only killed first but Also.) (in a delicious, nude bathing scene) is worth a visit to Solvang, California to hold an annual Danish festival. With all the hotels in the area well booked, the three pretty ladies have to dine in an elegant, but fearsome, secluded mansion that plays the down-the-wall Ernest Keller (delicious to geeky perfection of the late, grand Sydney Lassick) and his meek space and food looking for sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a very evil and deadly dark family secret that resides in his dank cellar: a portly, pathetic, incestuous man-child mongoloid named Junior (an alternately touching and frightening account of Stephen Furst's "Flounder in Animal House") Danny Steinmann, director of Danny Steinmann, with consistently fine acting, a convincingly perverse plot, excellent make-up by Craig Reardon, a pleasantly spooky atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow but steady Crotch, sympathetic, well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heart-rending closing statue (the incest subplot is struck with an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), this unjustly overlooked psycho-sleeper of the early '80s is worth a review.
