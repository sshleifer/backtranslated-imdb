It was such a treat when this show ran because it was so fresh, innovative and original. That makes every show I've ever seen boring. The moment the first episode aired, I was intrigued and connected to all the characters so easily (which usually never happens because I always hate some characters). It's a shame that this show does not have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen and that does not exaggerate my feelings for the show. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies ever, because what could ABC find to replace this show? This is by far the best show on TV. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and stayed because I fell in love with the entire show.
