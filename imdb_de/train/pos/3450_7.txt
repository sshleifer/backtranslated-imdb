I have never heard of this movie until I saw the rental DVD I somewhat skeptical. In the past there have been many films with good ensemble performers that can not do anything bad and in some cases do not seem to harm care. <br /> <br /> After watching it, there was no reason not to release this movie as a theatrical release, it's good. The story, like most in the genre, may seem a bit forced at times, but here too there seems to be a lot of realism that carries the momentum. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake has done with such a big role here. OK, he's not an Oscar-material yet, but he will learn with every role and shows a lot of promise for the future. Dylan McDermott was also amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, just give it a try. You will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, I think you will be more than satisfied with the end result.
