I have to admit that I was basically lost in the first half hour of this movie. There was a slightly amusing sense of humor, but at best a plunder of the barebones and a general sense of futility that was about to happen that I thought I was wasting my time. Then, for no apparent reason, I suddenly realized I enjoyed it. There was no dazzling moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that seized me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens throughout the movie. It was as if I suddenly understood that the film was to be largely pointless - and that it made its charm in its futility. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman played as an unnamed actor, a small project, "to advance his career. He will be playing a supermarket manager and spending the day in a neighborhood supermarket to explore the role. There he meets Scarlet (played by Paz Vega), a cashier who wants more from life. He helps her prepare for a job interview, as if she's auditioning for a role as she introduces him to real life. It's really funny to see "him" (that's how the character is identified in the credits) when he was overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. Freeman and Vega were great, with a strange but perfect credible kind of romance, but father-daughter chemistry. If you feel lost in the beginning, stick with it. In the end, it's a delightfully charming movie. 10.7
