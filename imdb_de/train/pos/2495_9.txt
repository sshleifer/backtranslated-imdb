A funny, funny and wonderful depiction of family life! The author Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny, foresighted and occasionally frightening! Yes, do not be fooled by the happy melodies and bubbly characters of 2point4 children. The show has a dark side and can be quite cool sometimes. And that's so good at the show, it's not just a simplified sitcom in which every character is a 2D comic device (the case at My Family). Instead, the characters are fully rounded individuals, showing the full roller coaster of human emotions. The occasional dark moments, such as Bill, who is allegedly pursued by a curse, and Ben, who wakes up in a bizarre village, are two examples of a surreal, dark twist that adds some depth to the scene. Of course, the show is also incredibly funny and will definitely make you smile. It is a pity that Eureka Video did not release this funny gold on DVD anymore. Veoh.com is your last hope to grab episodes that are not available in stores.
