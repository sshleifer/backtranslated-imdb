I'm really wondering how this show plays in the UK and the rest of Europe. It's so strange to be an American (especially white Americans). That could be a big reason for the poison and vitriol that is expressed here in this forum. I love the show, but there are some reservations, and I feel like it came out with Spoiler Spoiler easily: <br /> <br /> Second season demolition. Julie slammed the door to revive the show, unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, raunchy and occasionally scary show.
