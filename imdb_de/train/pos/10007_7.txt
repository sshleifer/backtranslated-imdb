THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (R: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcockian Susenser gives Williams an outstanding, restrained performance. <br /> <br /> What are celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia you associate with the other, and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the latest fan scenario, based on true events, Williams is referred to as a talk radio personality named Gabriel Nobody, who reads stories he wrote about the airwaves and accumulates an interesting fan The form of a boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who has submitted a manuscript about the troubles of his troubled youth to No one editor Ashe (Morton), who gives it to anyone who can read it himself. No one is naturally troubled, but in the end he is intrigued that Pete was abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette with Outstanding Achievement), but her correspondence with no one reveals that Pete AIDS dies. Of course, no one wants to hit the fans, but is suddenly in doubt about his potentially devious backgrounds when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale), whose sudden exit from her New York City home has nobody in an emotional tailspin just now growing up into a teacup storm when he decides to conduct research into the background of Donna and Pete to discover some truths he did not expect. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script) with his former lover Terry Anderson and film novice director Stettner) and based on a true story about a joke from a fan who found out He has some Hitchcock moments that run like any good old pot kettle at full speed. It helps that Williams offers a standout, restrained performance as the conflicting, kind-hearted personality who really wants to believe his number one fan is truly genuine and loves him (the only thing that has escaped his own reality). and has some disquieting, terrible moments with the spooky Collette, whose physical trait I will not mention, but she underlines the desperation of her character, which can rattle you to the marrow. <br /> <br /> However, the film runs out of gas and eventually, despite Stinkner's directed piece by Stinkner, becomes a bit repetitive and predictable, it's worth listening to your own inner voice: be careful with that, what you hope.
