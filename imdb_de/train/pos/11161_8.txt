This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it will translate well into other languages ​​or not. However, I believe that men around the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some degree! These thoughts are extremely entertaining, and women will certainly enjoy this movie. I am sure! <br /> <br /> All performers perform well, and this movie could have been a great success around the world if produced in England or the US. But for those of you lucky enough to understand Swedish, you'll be looking forward to something! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
