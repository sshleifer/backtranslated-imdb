In general it was a good movie with an ideal ending. The acting was spectacular and the characters did not depend on their characters. I really liked the plot, even though you knew what would happen, there were still surprises throughout the movie. However, I think that it could take a bit longer (maybe extended) until the end - for me it seemed like it was a bit rushed; as if the writer wanted to take the sheets out of the linen before the rain. For example: What happened to Tristan's brother Hayden? As far as we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he built the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Could be? If there is .. I can not wait to see it.
