I've just seen Hot Millions on TCM and completely forgot about this gem. Ustinov designs a clever and split action that cleverly turns him from a two-man cheater into a genius ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a bumbling secretary / neighbor, who has a hard time getting a job, but has a warm and vibrant personality that shows through in this image. She creates a beautiful portrayal of a warm, witty and real person who in the long run ... well ... Molden and Newhart as a top manager accepts the challenge of doing something that could be trivial roles and make them one of their own comic life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see, and I know, at least in Romero's case, that Ustinov supports the work. <br /> <br /> This movie is a review of the emerging computer age and its problems for the average cheater or man, but in fact the characters are so intriguing and it's so much fun to see that. The computer deal is almost lost ... I almost say. <br /> <br /> Lower your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and the friendly, forgiving and profound action in this image.
