The peaceful rancher Robert Sterling, with his ruthless neighbors, is on the losing side of a Range War, that is, until the notorious outlaw Robert Preston emerges out of the blue to level the playing field. Soon he begins to go too far and feeds in Sterling a growing sense of unrest, especially when his son begins to worship the crafty criminal. The sundowners are a taut, sombre and surprisingly tough little girl picture with a great performance from Preston. Here he acts like a nasty version of Shane until the true nature of the rancher and the relationship of the Outlaw are revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise! <br /> <br /> The cast is rounded off by Chill Wills, Jack Elam and the debut of John Drew Barrymore, who became more famous than his acting through his offspring.
