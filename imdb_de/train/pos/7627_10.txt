I remember seeing this movie some time ago, and after having seen 3000 miles to Graceland, everything was flooding back. Why was there no video or DVD release yet? It is blasphemous that this majesty of filmmaking was never published while other wastes have taken place. In fact, this is the film by John Carpenter, which was not published. I have not seen it on TV since the day I saw it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role for which he was born. John Zimmermann's break from the horror brought this gem that I would like to play the TV again. It is well played and well played, as far as the vocals are concerned. Most of Elvis' biggest hits are defeated with enthusiasm. I think this was also the film that established the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which made them make a number of great films (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Problem in Little China and Escape from LA Someone Give it out before anyone makes a remake or a separate version of his life, which in my opinion would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the spell he has here, if we do not, we will be in the heartbreak hotel.
