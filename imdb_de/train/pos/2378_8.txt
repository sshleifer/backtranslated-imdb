This movie is much better than the Asylum Version, mainly the War of the Worlds. The tripods look pretty cool, but their walking and their deaths could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Go for a walk Go for a walk !!! Oh my god, stop running, or I'll kill myself. The Thunder Kid scene was my favorite sequence, mainly because a ship had rammed a lot of tripods. Good movie that I recommend for people who have read the book. The music is great and the cut of the directors looks pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Professionals. 99% good soundtrack for the book Cool Violence Tripods and manipulators are cool to look at. some badly behaved cheesy-looking London
