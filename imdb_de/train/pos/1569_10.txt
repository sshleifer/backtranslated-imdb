I love this program! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are so different cats, but they collectively refer to themselves as "brothers". I often try to imitate the tired, sighing accent of her butler Hovis or even the Scottish district of Gordon. There should be more episodes about Human Kimberly. The episode about the cats dressing up as teenage girls to be admitted to Human Kimberly's slumber party to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can not drink Rootbeer in our house without making the Catscratch voices or the Hanson brothers from the movie 'Slap Shot'. Future classic Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
