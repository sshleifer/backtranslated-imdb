It is well known that anthology films do not perform well with American audiences (I think they prefer a standard plotline). New York, I Love You, is the second phase in a series of anthology films dealing with cities and people who live and love them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really liked. The film was made up of several segments, each written and / or directed by another director (most were French, but there is a very funny segment led by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like "Paris," this is also an anthology led by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalia Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), as well as "Paris' deals with New Yorkers" and why they like the city where they live offers a stellar cast including Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and veteran veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories are really flying and others are not (although I think that depends on the individual taste - I will not ruin it for anyone by finding out which worked for me and which did not). It is said that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece is out of the question?). Mainly spoken in English, but has some Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated by the MPAA with 'R' for strong language and sexual content
