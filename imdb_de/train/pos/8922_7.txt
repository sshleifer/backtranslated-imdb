The only thing notable about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first big lead. McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw, but refreshingly honest in this little sci-fi horror piece. Steve portrays himself as the anti-establishment and hot rod car-loving actor who would become a shining icon of the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later McQueen would say he hated this movie and that "he was the blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is sweet, fresh and innocent. It would be that we all stayed that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast and predictable, still a fun hour. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut, before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD some time ago and it's a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
