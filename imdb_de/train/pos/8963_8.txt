The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen in this romantic fantasy of a modern witch who seduces a successful Manhattan publisher with maximum star power. Although James Stewart may get a top-notch, it's Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most seductive witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. Lead-pairing is indeed one of the few weaknesses of the film: the gray-haired Stewart seems to be a bit old for the role, and although it's easy to see why he's having a tough time for Novak, it's a bit harder to understand what she is makes him attractive, since they disagree in temperament and outlook. (It's one of the amusing notions of the story that witches and warlocks are portrayed as beatniks and bohemians from Greenwich Village.) Oddly enough, the Stewart-Novak couple in Vertigo released in the same year as this movie would be much more Creating Warmth Then Vertigo had a thrilling story and the benefits of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the movie are mainly provided by the great performers, including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's sorcerer). , Elsa Lanchester (her gloomy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a confused writer. Hermine Gingold shows up even in a funny cameo as a kind of Grand Witch. There is much to like in this film - wit, romance and a great cast - that is, if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I've watched the movie half a dozen times and never can.
