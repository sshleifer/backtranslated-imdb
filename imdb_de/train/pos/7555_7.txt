Gender Bender does a lot with x files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an end that's missing. Gender Bender is also the debut of X-Files for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man who is being attacked by "The Kindred". You just have to see this episode to see Nic Lea less than a spectacular start. An interesting thing about the "seductiveness" of Kindred. When Marty does it to his victims, they are turned to him. But when Andrew seduces Scully, she is just disoriented and dazed and does not attract Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it was miserable sometimes to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, it's so wet, muddy and mushy that it was not so much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode.
