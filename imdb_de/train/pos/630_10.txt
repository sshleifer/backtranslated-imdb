I did not expect much from this movie. I received a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just left work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the film series, and it seemed as if no cool air would flow through the corridors of the theater complex. As soon as the movie was tired and frustrated in the theater, the film started I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. From the beginning, I was involved with the film and got excited by the minute. I think this movie should be a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were fantastic, the pace was perfect and the ending was magical.
