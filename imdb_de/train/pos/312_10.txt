Based on a true story, this series is a jewel of its kind. The slave who becomes queen by conquering the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond commander - appointed by the King of Portugal - the ultimate authority Growing up in the relative security of his home, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva sees her world threatened as he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in the city. He does not want to acknowledge that a black slave could be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save herself, Xica steals the diamonds the diamond commander has collected for the king to use for the escape. However, the king's army arrives the next day to collect the diamonds. When the loot has disappeared, the commander of the diamonds is taken away in chains, his family expropriated and thrown on the street, only the clothes on his back. Martin, son of the diamond commander, swears revenge. Xica and the other slaves, however, are auctioned and Xica ends up in the house of the sergeant major, an old man who has only bought her to extinguish his lust. However, the new diamond commander, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes, arrives in Tijuco. Immediately struck by Xica's beauty, he manipulates the sergeant major and sells it to him. And so begins a love story full of dangers, intrigue and passion between a willing nobleman and a cunning slave girl who will rise to become a queen. The series is full of detailed details from the epoch of faith, superstition, politics, fashion, etc., etc. And it really manages to attract your attention every minute. Sometimes funny with sarcastic and dark humor, full of tension and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
