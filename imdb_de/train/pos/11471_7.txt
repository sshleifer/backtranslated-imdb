I'm a big fan of the cinema and have seen this movie because I've heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was really interesting. The two main characters are great, the movie is not boring and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the Columbine murders and the murderer's home videos) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes, that really affect the realism of the first hour, and the end makes no sense whatsoever. The shaky camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema that's a matter of course. But I still think that the film is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves credit.
