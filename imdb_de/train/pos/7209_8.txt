I bought certain movies on CD, although the second-rate presentation was not an option. One particular company that I can not identify here has several pan and scan DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80" and these, to name only three!) From films I believe that nobody wants to see them in this compromised format. Some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are only in their theatrical release ratio 1.66: 1. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Deathtrap" was scary and strange enough, amusing image , My only complaint is the Tinny rating (what are those instruments that are usually filmed in 18th-century France?) And Dyan Cannon, who screams regularly. Could not her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed an inhaler when she was stressed? Little complaints, both. The benefits of data storage include fast forwarding to get beyond what you do not like. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a staged version of "Deathtrap" so these roles play a big role in their roles at the time. Before Broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theater was more affordable for the average person. Anyone who pays less than a king's ransom for live entertainment is unlikely to go to a hit show in the big, hyped way. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both big, virile specimens of the '80s at the beginning and that's essential to how we're going to respond to their job and their overall image. They are definitely not literal men who can not fight or come back from an obstacle. The two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate "death trap".
