"Convicts" is a kind of third act. The entire dialogue and interaction between the characters that appear in it comes from the long process of a late southern day. And thus the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago, they worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful," a film that seems almost action-packed compared to this film. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is just this page of adequate. The slow pace leaves plenty of room for the cameraman Toyomichi Kurita, who pervades the film with the right feeling for fragile light and warmth Editing or conductivity, it all depends on the acting. There are no shortcomings for me here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are completely real and are interested in nothing but life. Lukas Haas, a young actor I knew from "Testament" and "Witness," plays a character very similar to his other early roles. He is calm, withdrawn, a little scared and somehow sad. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Maybe a title like "Convicts" is a disadvantage for this movie. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to create a picture of a much higher western image. If you are not particularly interested in slow stage productions, you should share them. Otherwise, this could be exactly the movie you want it to be made more often. <br /> <br /> Have fun.
