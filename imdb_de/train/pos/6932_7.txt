WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with getting back his precious possessions, a repeating rifle from Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stewart persistently sticks to it. This 1950s B & W effort by Anthony Mann is more of a crime film than a traditional western, and the cowboys are more like modern gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue, who goes to a ranch with a man she can marry (Charles Drake). She eventually falls in love with Stewart, but not until she's passed around. Winters is the most complex character in a movie with unusual characters. Watch out for a young Dan Dureyea as a nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A desperately miscarried Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
