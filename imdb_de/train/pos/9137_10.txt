This is the only movie I saw Prince in, but it does not matter. And I thought that he was just great at singing boy, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. That's why in 1984 it won the Academy Award for best music for a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt. Although the cursing with the movie is in the way (make sure no kids or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You really should go and get this movie, your collection is not complete, unless you have this movie in it. What else could I say except for this movie?
