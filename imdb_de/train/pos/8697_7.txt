Often loud, funny games about sex, family and the classes in Beverly Hills milk laugh out of the zip code more than it has ever seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. Plot focuses on two chauffeurs who have bet on which of them can go to bed his employer (both single or soon single-ladies, very sexy - Bisset and Voronov). If Manuel wins, his friend pays his debts to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the lowest man to his friend! <br /> <br /> Lots of slippery dialogue, pretty sick bodily humor etc. But a lot of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual or family member of the family, who takes his sexy, teenage niece on a one-year "mission trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Hilarious fun.
