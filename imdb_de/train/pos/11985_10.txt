I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old. I kept watching it until I was seven. Then I got older and discovered that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. There was also the fact that my younger brother, who had been faithfully watching me for two years, refused to find it girly. <br /> <br /> Then every afternoon at five I realized that it was the 23rd and I became addicted to it again. Full House made me laugh and cry. I realized how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House and a mother. I've heard that people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get hurt. The three men who live with the girls may at times get into quarrels. What is more real than that? <br /> <br /> If anything the show has raised me to, when I'm down, and bring me up even higher than I thought I was at the point of complete satisfaction. I cried like a hyena on the show and am obsessed with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has conquered this place, but they were literally the cutest babies I've ever met, they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)
