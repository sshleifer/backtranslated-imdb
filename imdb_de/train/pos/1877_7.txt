Arthur Bach is extremely unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire and is attracted by followers "under him" in a social position - he paid in the opening scenes a hooker and is then attracted by a shoplifter He also drinks quite a lot and sometimes he drives while drinking which of course is not funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, but behind the comedy is some reality. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on the canvas and creates a figure for eternity. Talk about earning an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but Gielgud as "Hobson" will remember you most.
