The best part about this movie is that it's fun. It's full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the wild, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong), who photographs almost everything he sees in daily life. Other great characters are Pecker's boyfriend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is a sugar addict), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother, who finds life in a Marian atonement in her room. <br /> <br /> The film cautiously makes a point of how everyday life has many treasures to offer and manages to get there without feeling cumbersome. When you make messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people," there is always the danger of getting into a sort of reverse "holier than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps and allows the audience to get the point while allowing enough room for onlookers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie mainly because it's a lot of fun.
