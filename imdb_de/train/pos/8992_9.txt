A really cool movie. A must for every music snob. You do not really need to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from the dandy Warhols. The only thing that is needed is open-mindedness. <br /> <br /> The film is about the Brian Jonestown massacre. The Dandy Warhols play a role as a "rival band" in the movie, but are the second biggest role of the BJM. The Dandy Warhols are not as big a part of the movie as I initially thought, but they also did not have the element of BJM excitement and unpredictability and its very charismatic frontman, Anton Newcombe. By itself, it is a revealing film and a study of the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
