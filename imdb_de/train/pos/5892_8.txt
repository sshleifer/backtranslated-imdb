Thomas Ince has always had a lot to offer when it came to bringing simple homespun stories to life with abundance and flair. "The Italian" is such a movie. Solid drama, especially by George Beban, the father of dumb child actor George Beban Jr., and wonderful sets convey a realistic feel of early immigrant homes in New York. This gives this film of 1915 an authenticity that is unusual in the features of this vintage. The film begins with the modern and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we go into the story with George, who plays the immigrant. He collects enough money to bring his fiancee from Italy to America, marries her and has a son with him. But times are tough and the family is fighting for survival. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her baby and avoid the complications with the dirty formula, but well, even the early Dream Factory pushed politically correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to take revenge on a criminal boss who unintentionally put him in prison, and decides at the last minute against his planned course of action. Well maintained. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" an 8 out of 10 points.
