As another IMDB reviewer has noted, this movie starts a little slowly, but it gets better over time. Yes, it's being published by Roger Corman, and yes, it's about some of the same thematic reasons as with higher-budget predecessors like FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. The juxtaposition of the woman's career as a rising blues singer against the increasing loneliness of the husband and his almost joyous need to fill the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she is away with the skillful use of minimal effects and attitudes nicely done. By using a very small number of locations and characters, as well as using water in almost every scene as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol, this film, while clearly under a tiny budget, reminds me in many ways of what is full Realized and realized is the younger scenario, namely the French movie "SWIMMING POOL", which I think has borrowed some useful ideas from "UP AGAINST AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAIN AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of occasionally relishing pleasurable temptations, but does so as well or better than other films in the genre. The turn of stepfather's abuse of Amanda in the past (again very Freudian) is also unique and interesting in this genre. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic response to Amanda's fate that evokes this aspect of the story. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
