This is an excellent movie. The cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. Essentially, the film is about a well-trained doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and bringing them home. Once the bodies are at home, he removes things (I hate to use such a generic term, but I've forgotten what he's removed) and submit it to his wife to keep their youth. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, examines the situation and begins to find answers to why the brides were dying. She makes a trip to the medical center and the interesting things start to happen. Be sure to check out this vintage, but goodie if you can.
