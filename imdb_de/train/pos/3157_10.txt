"That '70s Show" is definitely the funniest show on TV. I started it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I could say it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a great character when he was there. I really hope he comes back because he is hilarious. It's classic when Fez is "you son of a bitch!" Go, and if Kelso "burns!" Cries, it always makes me laugh. Both are great characters and always have something funny to say. That Jackie is hot is just another reason to see the show. She looked very good, but damn it, somewhere in the 5th through 6th seasons she just got really hot. I've seen most episodes more than once, some ten times, and still weird there. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over again and still laugh the way I saw it the first time. The cast is classic; Almost everyone is funny, where there are only a few funny characters on many shows. I'm going to be sad when this show comes to an end next year, but it's being broadcast as one of the best shows ever.
