So, what is the reason? Is there a kind of vendetta against this great show or someone involved? Why should the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I am addicted. I happened to see this show in the fall and was immediately enthusiastic and watched it every week. Then it went away and I tried it with Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on TV it was refreshing to see something so rounded and developed today. I'm watching Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic correction and House for my intellectual-mysterious correction. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for her "realism," and I hate the show, but it could not be further from reality for me. Far too much drama. Everything that can go wrong does. But for once, there is a drama that is REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes, like a former gangster who went well, a girl running in front of the mob, etc., but these people (especially in New York City) are really out there and I'm referring to everyone single of them. I just can not get enough. I just hope that ABC gets their heads out of their bean counters and continues this show. Get respect for a QUALITY drama. This could be one of the best shows ever. If somebody just allows it.
