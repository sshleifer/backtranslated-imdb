I think the team behind this movie did a great job with the limitations they had. Only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film, and edit the whole thing, which in my opinion is a feat in itself. Although this movie is not for the masses (since a young innocent teenage girl is killed and homo-eroticism is involved in the story), I think this movie is a heartbreaking tragedy and the deeper you get involved in the story, more sadness that you feel. More about Heaton because of the love he feels, but not returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies that I really enjoyed and would see again. I think it is a shame that the movie is not heard well at all.
