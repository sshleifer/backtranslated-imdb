Nothing is more fun to me than a who-dun-it or suspense story that consistently suggests you how the whole thing will end. And that's what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a refreshing play by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> And this is where MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE can do the trick, the Caine and Laurence Olivier prevailed in SLEUTH - with almost as much skill and as many puzzles as in this exceptionally skillful game ever gave. <br /> <br /> But it's meant to scare you, surprise you and let you guess. As far as the bottom line is concerned, it's difficult to write a report on the story. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous dramatist whose latest play has failed miserably. When young, aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that if Caine abandons him as his own, it will solve his problems and get his reputation back. <br /> <br /> From then on, it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story unfolds and trumps Agatha Christie for the number of turns. Caine and Reeve brilliantly play each other, each bringing some dynamic excitement to the storyline, as well as some humorous accents that come from a script that permeates drama with humor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: worth seeing - but not all are satisfied with the end.
