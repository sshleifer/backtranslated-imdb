Rosenstraße is a touching story of courage in distress. Dutch women realize that their Jewish husbands are imprisoned until deportation. An aristocrat, Lena Fischer, who was rejected by her family, finds herself among the crowd, as does the sister of General Gudarian. Rank and privilege, however, deserve no special consideration. <br /> <br /> Also the service as a female prisoner, whose husband is on the Eastern Front, is not taught to the Reich. In one of the film's most awful scenes, the guards take the wedding band given by their soldier. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe that this is a typical German brutality, today in America we have ordered Lady Bush to arrest the Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US military personnel killed in the action), because their presence is offensive. Unfortunately, little has changed in the 60's from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. Fortunately, the eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes the capture. Waiting in the cold at Rosenstraße Lena Fischer initially hesitates to accept Ruth in a way that we consider typically German. Even Lena Fischer's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who knows and rejects Holocost, warns Lena against it. but Lena decides to embrace the idea with an American rebel that even names Ruth, the more Arian-sounding name Helga Lehmann. The siege ends favorably in Rosenstrasse, but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah sets out to find her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena on the pretext of writing a personal story of the war. <br /> <br /> I thought it was interesting that Hannah wanted it so much. Check out the family, but you never looked for the fate of her grandfather who last served on the Eastern Front.
