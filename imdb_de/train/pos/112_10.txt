EUROPE (CENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the creation of narrative film almost a century ago. This movie is really unique and a genius work. The camera work and editing are brilliant, and in conjunction with the narrative alienation tropes used in the film, it creates an eerie and memorable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast is two guilt feelings that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow delivers his great voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> A unique movie! Four stars (highest rating).
