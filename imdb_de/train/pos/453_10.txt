I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie that does not contain dirty words, sex and violence. You could call it "the ultimate chick movie," but I'll bet there are one or two enlightened men who love it too. Do not invite the children. This movie is very restrained. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and the beautiful landscape, together with the gentle manners of the ladies, are reminiscent of the tranquility and beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> So no one thinks that your only really sees a kind of movie, I'll frame a line that I once heard on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies "The Deer Hunter "and" Enchanted April "are.
