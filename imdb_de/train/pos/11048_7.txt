I did not feel like this movie was as smart as it seemed, but it was still fun. <br /> <br /> It's original, though it reminds me a bit of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly because of the color scheme, but also because of the angular quality of the close-ups of the characters. <br /> <br /> Settled in a jail cell, but do not let this put you off, this movie seems to be more than some blockbusters with many locations. good in the foreground and very good characterization, which makes some just too believable! Creepy, with a bit of Gore this is worth a visit.
