I saw this for the first time in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really into the movie, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. This is a great cast of characters, including many big names, some of which were not as well recognized as they are today. I think it would be a great idea if you followed one of these actors or loved him in other films to add him to your watchlist. Some of the scenes actually remind me of the kind of well-done comedy like The Birdcage or even The Clue, a sort of spontaneous comedy with some really professional depictions of these popular actors. The film has done a great job of giving you a glimpse into the culture of a daytime soap, maybe even very realistically.
