Absolutely fantastic garbage ... it has everything: nudity, good fighting scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. It also shows the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga, as the other reviewer noted - though Olga becomes Ingrid Later in the movie ( You need to look at it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I'm not going to deal with the story as it's too long-winded and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the towel steal the scene to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were suddenly quite good and were then spoiled by a really bad gore effects that looked as if they were made by City of the Walking Dead (ie strangely colored blood coming out of the wounds bubbles). <br /> <br /> I would advise fans of low budget trash to look at this If they can locate a specimen - it's pretty rare, and I never saw anyone who took the trouble to see it republished, so it will become rarer in a few years. Anyway, I 'll only recommend it for Belinda Maynes's great nude scenes! This lady is a fox!
