Not only is this a great African American classic comedy, but also one of many great American cult classics. I recently purchased the collection edition of Rudy Ray Moore. They do not make films like this anymore. My whole family is a movie lover, so this site is an extreme help in solving many debates. I'm currently in Iraq. This helps me to stay in touch with the world I know in the States. Thanks a lot IMDb.I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolemite Rules! Do not just take my word for it, look at it yourself. Ten lines are a lot for commenting a movie, I think, but when it clarifies the point, I'm all in favor!
