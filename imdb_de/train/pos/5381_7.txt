It was really good for a low budget movie. I put this far beyond the average action B movie. Sean and Corinne delivered this film, and they did not seem to be camera-shy. Pay attention to the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers would even consider that, but the runners-up earn so much. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more engagement from Sean and Corinne in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very sincere, and the sexy Corinne character was pretty stubborn and punctual. She has been well connected with the course of action and executed with confidence. It was a great idea to use Billy Zane as the smart and witty villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences were not cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie. Of course there were shortcomings, but that comes with the territory. Overall, this was a good movie given the budget and the fact that he was made for television. Sean and Corinne did a good job, considering they are newbies in the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star ensemble will get their chance to be part of the entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: *** / ****
