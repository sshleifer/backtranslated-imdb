Prison is not often talked about in conversation about the best horror films of the eighties, and for a good reason, because it's not one of the best ... but if you skip past the classic films that the decade has to offer, that's for sure the case among the best of the lesser known / smaller films. The film has a connection to blockbusters. First, it is an early directorial work for Renny Harlin; the capable director behind a series of action films, including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and second, we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original, but the plot is interesting. We focus on a prison that reopened after a few years. In this prison, a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after he was framed by the governor of the prison. Of course, the spirit of the dead does not rest in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes revenge. The film is not exactly the Shawshank Redemption, but he's careful to build his different characters. The movie's main point is always the horror, the prison drama behind it is an interesting base. This is also a good job, because apart from the basic requirement, the movie has no real plot, and we rely only on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror of the film is at times grotesque, but never exaggerated. That might be the reason why this film is rarely remembered since it was released in a decade of excess. However, the murders themselves are pretty good and imaginative and offer some important highlights. As the movie continues, we begin to delve more into the backstory of the vengeful convict's mind, and although it's quite interesting, some things make no sense about it and pull the movie down a bit. Still, everything is going to be an exciting climax, and overall I have to say that Prison is a movie that's worth tracking down.
