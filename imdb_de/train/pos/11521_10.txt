Mages are a wonderful ride from start to finish, thanks mainly to the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin has been fantastic in one of his best roles for decades. As with any really fine movie, this is a journey where the theme is salvation and the results of dreaming. I can not believe this movie is so hard to find - I would buy it in a heartbeat on DVD, but have not found a paragraph yet.
