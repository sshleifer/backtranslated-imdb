In this sequel to action comedy classic K-9, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight the crime, but this time they've teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner Doberman named Zues, who does not get along very well with Jerry Lee. Dooley does not do much with his new partner either. It all changes in the course of the movie. The film is intense because he's a guy who really wants to kill Dooley, the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes involving the death of Dooley's wife, who do not really seem to care about the sound of the movie, because the rest of the movie consists of action sequences, dog-jack joke, fart joke and joke about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know it looks like a very weak sense of humor, but some of them are actually very funny. I did not see this movie as jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I'm a big fan of James Belushi and second for the action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than in K-9 and the action sequences are better too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9, but it's still a funny movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
