A really great movie and a true story. Dan Jansen the greatest skater ever. A touching and beautiful movie that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansen's fight against cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. An important promise by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane rightly believed in his talent for speed skating was justified. This picture is worth the time. I wish they would make more films of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and an excellent story. It is a very touching story about a nice family support and a good faith for her children and a special dream for her youngest son and sister.
