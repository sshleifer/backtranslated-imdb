Big splashy movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll dice and organize illegal manure games. Blonde Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him IF he abandons craps. He chooses one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets on big bets, is in town. He tells Sky that he can not get missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go to Havana with him. This may sound like a strange plot summary, but the movie is like that! <br /> <br /> This is a real mix - there are wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible. The actual showstopper is the crap game in the end. Brando is really good here as well - it may seem strange when he sings and dances, but he does. I have to admit that the big, bulky brando, who performed some difficult dance moves, was a lot of fun! Sinatra is pretty good too and Blaine is just wonderful as his boring girlfriend. Your song and dance numbers are definitely highlights here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she has a dark, colorless role and can not do much with it. The movie is far too long at 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag on and should be cut. Most characters also speak very precise English contractions are never used. It may be amusing to come out of the mouths of gangsters, but I found it staggering and it kept throwing me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth it for the songs and dances, but the extra length comes to you after a while. I give a 7.
