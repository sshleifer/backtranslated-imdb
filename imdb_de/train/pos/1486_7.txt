I was very happy to see a Milanese film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who correctly understood the Milanese philosophy in a movie and fortunately printed it in a film. The film tells the story of a typical Milanese couple, from "birth" to death. The birth wedding is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and involves all wedding guests in a flashback story of how the couple collided and fell in love. Life in the "urbe" of Milan is hard, and after the sweetheart of old times became harder and harder, the product finally became: a child that does not further strengthen the couple relationship, but weakens it, because "the selfish effect" today "metropolis "Personality. The advertising environment with all the "creative" under stressful atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot. We are losing the liveability and this is reflected well and deeply in this nice and sharp film by the director of Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well-characterized and a positive surprise, an unexpectedly good Fabio Volo, known for the TV series "Trash": Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
