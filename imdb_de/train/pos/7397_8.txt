"Xizao" is the story of the clash of modern life with ancient traditions and its impact on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) believes that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) has died. He finds out that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, the public bath. The film revolves around the family of Da Ming and how he must learn the importance of his father's work, which he had always considered as an ancient tradition that soon had to die. The film also explores his relationship with Er-Ming, who is spiritually challenged, and the problems of the small community, and how the bathroom is a place where not only their bodies, but also their souls are cleansed. <br /> <br /> The movie's two main themes, the family and the problems of progress, are handled incredibly well, and the movie never loses the point it tries to make. Both topics are very well developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> Director Yang Zhang tells his story in a simple way and lets the characters do the work. It's a very simple approach, but it fits in perfectly with the movie, and I doubt very much that another style would work so well with the movie. Zhang has tremendous potential as he can tell a story without visual stray light or camera ticks. <br /> <br /> The play is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone looks very natural and it almost looks like they were real people being filmed. The three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming steals the show for sure. <br /> <br /> Even if the film could hang on a patronizing "old-time-was-much-better" message, it takes an attitude of balance, as if we say that progress is good, and we have to go on, but we must not forget where we come from and maintain a balance between modern life and ancient traditions. <br /> <br /> and touching movie. 8.10
