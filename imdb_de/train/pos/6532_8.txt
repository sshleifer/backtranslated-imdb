I think part of the reason why this movie was made ... is for us gamers who actually play all Nancy Drew PC games. Lately, there have been a lot of movies based on video games, and I think that's the case in one of them. <br /> <br /> This movie does not follow a book. However, it follows a part of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games have actually won the Parents' Choice Gold Awards. Not only are they fun, but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my stepchildren to see it and they loved it! The 10 year old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game one day before I took her to the movie, and she had so much fun playing the game, I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right ... she not only loved this movie, she could not wait to get home to finish her first game and start a new one. <br /> <br /> My other stepdaughter is only 7 years old and she also loved the movie but is still a little too young to play the games yet but she enjoys watching her sister sometimes just to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> The games are for children over 10 years old. All games are usually rated fairly decent and classified as adventure games. For more information about the games, see HerInterative Nancy Drew Games. I personally thought the movie was pretty good and I will buy it when it appears on DVD.
