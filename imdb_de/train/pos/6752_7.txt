A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for being violent accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and tries to cover him up. The director of Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is watered down when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. It was good for him to dig himself into a big hole, but at the end of the tunnel she was just too light for a noir movie. Gary Merrill is awesome as Scalese, a criminal boss Andrews is obsessed with, and the tension between them gives the movie its energy and drive, especially a scene in a bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand and the night time rendezvous outside Bellevue Hospital, which determines what the end of the film should have been. Good scores for atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill etc. and the general depiction of the underworld, though the love angle and the simple good policemen do not help bad policemen.
