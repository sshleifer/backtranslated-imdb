My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I've always loved spooky movies) and even then I liked it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes in which the camper in the desert is attacked. The rocks actually convince for a low budget strip. Acting is above average for these types of films and the music is scary. This is definitely a gem that was rated by Uuder. I would recommend it to anyone who likes those weird late seventies and early eighties movies like "Alice, Sweet Alice," "Poor Pretty Eddie," "Nightmare," "Hospital Massacre," and "Return of the Aliens, the Deadly spawning ". Definitely a classic !!
