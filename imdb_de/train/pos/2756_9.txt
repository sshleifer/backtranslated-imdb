I chose this movie based on the abstracts and quotes from the critics on the back of the box. I'm not exactly into foreign films and I did not know what to expect. I'm not really interested in subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, lovable quality that makes you feel good in life. I always had to laugh out loud. I would recommend this image to anyone, even those who loathe foreign movies with subtitles. This makes it worth the effort.
