Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this launch of 1984 featured gangster films. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars are Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who gets a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him in a flashback how he owned the pet store. He turned to theft at a young age to give his mother a pancreas operation ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the gangster world. <br /> <br /> There are some funny scenes in this film, and Stapleton is an uprising as Johnny's sullen mother ever has to replace organ in her body. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss is a very funny performance, as is Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who will not "play ball" with the crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is an outstanding representative of Moronie, who torments the English language - but you have to hear him listening instead of reading about it. What makes it funny is that he does everything with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a bit tired in the end, but it's well worth a visit and Keaton is fantastic as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" incredibly enjoyable.
