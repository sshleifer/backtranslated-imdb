This film documents the Harlem Ball circle of the mid-eighties. Much more fun than the Palazzo Volpi, though he is as ill as he is, this movie is a real misery. You can not help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness. The sole purpose of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and shine. Here is the most ingenious garbage extremely well documented and neatly glamorous. The idiosyncrasies of the characters for the idolatry of everything that is glamorous inspires the audience to more admiration for the characters themselves and creates a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" that turns this film into a work of art.
