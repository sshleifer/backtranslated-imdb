"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts movies I've seen. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese peasant boy visiting a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of "Way of the Dragon". Wherever Sammo goes, the trouble starts, so he has to rely on his martial arts to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol Bruce Lee. He even pats his nose with his thumb, just like Bruce Lee, and lets go of his screeching scream. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like seeing a fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the film, there is a great showdown, consisting of foreign fighters. Sammo has to hit each opponent individually. A bit like "The Game of Death", where every fighter has a different martial arts discipline. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that I really enjoyed, and also saw the very first Sammo Hung films I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and many laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie that I warmly recommend to all martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
