Three is the number of flying creatures: the mechanical horse, the genius and the genius and the magic carpet. The genius offers Abu three wishes during his first of three encounters; Three times the genius laughs aloud in the gulches, and three are his reflections on human frailty before he leaves. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of the Dawn (Armed Guards, Giant Spider and Giant Squid).
