This is a strange movie for me, after reviewing a nice movie by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to see and listen to his movie THE CURE check . I usually do not watch movies this way, but heck, I love shorts and could not wait to see another one. Interestingly, I found that I did not like THE CURE, and let Jafri know. Thankfully, he encouraged me to check it anyway - and gave me my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction is concerned, he's extraordinary - especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first movie). The combination of exceptional color, timing and music options that were suitable for the film created a great atmosphere. They are really involved in the film and that is a merit of filmmaking. What I did not love was part of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the end was just too predictable. I would really have loved the end if it had come as a surprise or as an unexpected turn. However, considering that this film is by someone who, due to his experience, should not be able to make such a professional film, this is a good sign of his future. Well done.
