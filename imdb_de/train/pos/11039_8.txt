Well, I would call that a good horror. With occult / supernatural undertones excited this nice, cheap French film already in the first scene my attention. This proves that you do not need wild effects or much gore to create an effective horror movie. The storyline revolves around 4 cellmates in a jail, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more interesting as the film builds suspense until the finale. Most of the action is seen through the eyes of Carrere, who has just gone to jail and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this movie really deserves to be seen wider. However, there are some shortcomings: The FX are not that good, but they are used effectively. The plot leaves some secrets open; and things get very confusing in the end, but Malefique redeems himself when it's over. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
