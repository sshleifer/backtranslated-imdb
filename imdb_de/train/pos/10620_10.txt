At first sighting I found this story at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many others, I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but two things that make the movie, even the vocals, worthwhile. One is the art direction. As with the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated historical piece. Each piece of fabric and jewel (both of which have a major part in the plot of this film) look fresh and new, contrasting with the simple clothes of the farmers. Even during the love song I learn the dress and the hair of the princess, made wonderful. The other thing is the weird timing. Much of the film is cheesy, but the emperor's vanity (and his mocking at the end), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing Nicholas, and the stupid prince, were all pretty funny and seem ridiculous on purpose. And the sequence during the song Weave-O makes up for the songs that were not that good.
