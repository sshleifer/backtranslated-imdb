Plato's Run is an entertaining b-movie starring Gary Busey. It's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw it in a trunk. I thought that looks entertaining, to which I was right. Gary Busey plays Plato Smith, a tough mercenary framed in the assassination of a powerful Cuban criminal who is now on the run, has to survive Plato long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends, by Steve Bauer (Scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). What I liked so much about Plato's Run was the way the movie never got bored. The plot might have been done earlier, but it was still good that the acting was fun and the action was pretty funny. Especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic because he usually plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer as Plato's buddy is good, even Jeff Speaksman does a good job, and he can not even be good enough to finish Plato's Run. It is an enjoyable effort of nu image films, and I give 7 out of 10 points
