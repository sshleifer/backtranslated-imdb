In this movie you can see if you are married or married. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we experience today in the world is awful and this film will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> A must. I hope it will be distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the actors and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and a 10 star rating from me!
