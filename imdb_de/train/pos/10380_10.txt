In 1976 I had just moved to Ceylon. I was 23 years old and married for over three years and started to get lesbian. I saw this film on an old black and white TV, with terrible reception, alone and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of history. I lived in a small house in Tucson, Arizona, and it was summer. Like everyone else here, I've never forgotten the feelings the pictures of this story evoked, and the rest of fragile magic. I would one day see it again. I will continue checking in. I also wish someone would do a film of Shirley Verel's The Other Side of Venus. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent seasoning ...
