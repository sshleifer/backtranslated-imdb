This is the second Animatrix short form, and the first of them could be called "artistic." It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a running time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human" or trying to direct hatred of humans for their "sins against machines". I do not think that's right. It only uses the robots to show us that as humans we are not particularly receptive or open-minded. I would say that it does a good job. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document and tells what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So it contains excerpts from fictitious news and the like. The voice output is very good, if not much of it is available. The animation is beautiful and the use of color despite the normally realistic drawing style makes it more open to the smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has some violent acts of violence and disturbing pictures as well as some nudity. The CD contains a comment that is not in English but subtitled. There is also a well-made and informative making-of based on both parts. So I would advise to see it after the next one. I recommend it to anyone who likes the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8.10
