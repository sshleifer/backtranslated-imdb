A Chinese ghost story plays the late, great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a destitute tax collector who wants to spend the night in an abandoned temple, where he meets and falls into a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who had to seduce victims for a wicked tree spirit who feeds on 'chi' (life force), he decides to free the girl by giving her a rightful burial. With the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling successfully kills the Tree Spirit, but also has to fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, with whom Tsing is married. <br /> <The first Hong Kong movie I saw, which was not a pure martial arts action, opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical realm where beautiful female spirits live, innocent heroes, shabby Heroes, sword Taoist monks, monstrous spirits and dark lords of the underworld; I immediately fell in love with the exuberance, the energy, the humor, the ingenuity and the visual excellence of the film. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this amazing movie is still one of the best examples of its genre I've ever seen? A lush, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. Featuring an outstanding directing by Siu-tung Ching, an outstanding adaptation by David Wu, an impressive cinematography and a whole range of imaginative special effects (including a huge killer tongue, a lot of Tentacled monster and several flying heads!) An absolutely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable one Experience.
