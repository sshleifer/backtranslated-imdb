I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get full! Every aspect of human emotion is magically captured by the drama, script, direction, and general feel of this film. It has been a long time since I saw a movie that made me choke with laughter, reflected in sadness, and felt every intentional feeling that comes through in this excellent work! We need MORE FILMS like that !!! Mike Binder: are you listening ???
