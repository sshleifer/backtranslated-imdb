What's up with you, if you're not into the action-car sequences and hot body of Jessica Simpsons, then you're mostly screwed in the head. Of course, the movie is not a masterpiece, I do not think he wanted to be. It was funny and funny, I never saw the show when I was younger. I have recently seen an episode, and when I saw the movie, I felt it had the same atmosphere. The cinema seats were shaky and the vehicle sequences were good because they did not bore me and as some of the scenes dragged in 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson is just hot, I just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, I had a hell of a lot of time watching it and would soon see it again and will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it, what it is.
