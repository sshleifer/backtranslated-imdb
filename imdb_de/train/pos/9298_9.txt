Just one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of the criminal life, a parody of everything that represents Chicago in 1930. There is no reason to underestimate this movie as the rating is below 5. Anyone who chooses to see it - will regret it, who decides not to see it - will regret it more.
