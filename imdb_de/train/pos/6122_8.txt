This movie is absolutely funny. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer turned into a snowman by a chemical B-movie accident. He then goes to town and begins to terrorize the locals. It's up to the local police chief and a few other characters to stop him. It's done on a small budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows it's garbage. The improvisations of Styrofoam and Styrofoam, which mimic the giant killer snowman, are classic and this is clearly the intention - one of the few films whose budget is considered the main sales target. In addition to comic tackiness, there are other great moments in the comedy: Listen to the voice of a father frightening his children to death and the funniest rape scene ever set for the movie. fantastic sticky fun
