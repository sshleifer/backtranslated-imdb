I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90s when it was first released. Room with a view was also new. The enchanted April had so much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for "normal". At the end of the movie, I felt the same way I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice. I longed for the characters to find what they were looking for, whether isolation, peace, freedom or love. Everywhere you have the feeling that Italy is so far from everything that you have ever known, that it is so decadent to take a risk and leave behind everything that is cumbersome and difficult. But in the heat of spring in April, all people loosen up and loose (in line with the Victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilding to the satisfaction of all. What a little gem of a movie! How come that it is not known?
