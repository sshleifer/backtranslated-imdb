The movie Freddy's Dead Nightmare is just as disgusting and disturbing as any other nightmare on Elm Street, yes, he has comedy essence and all the other movies, but how can anyone say that you would not find Freddy Krueger scary if you had that man in your dreams, you would not find him even more frightening with a weird essence about him because his comedy shows he does not care to kill you, that he finds it extremely funny, and Freddy also plays comic mind games with them, which is very disturbing in his own way, using his comic methods, making the horror movies Nightmare on Ulm Street what they are today. Unlike Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and does not have the mind, his To really scare victims, this movie is about as good as Freddy's joke and I would recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor wise "not falling asleep!".
