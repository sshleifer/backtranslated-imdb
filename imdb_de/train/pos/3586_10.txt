I saw this for the first time when it premiered more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still influenced me a lot. She Fought Alone is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who loves to hurt girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she's being raped, the clique turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). This film tells Caitlin's fight against an entire city. It also includes a high school where athletes can essentially determine the social environment so they can cope with anything they want. Thiessen and Green are the top performers and there is real chemistry between the two throughout the movie. All the actors in this movie, inspired by the actual events, did a great job. She fought alone to understand what it means to be in high school (at least in 1995), and when you have your self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
