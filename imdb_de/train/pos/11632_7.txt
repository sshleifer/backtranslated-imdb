Greetings from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this cute little classic suspense thriller by the famous horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" movies and "A Nightmare on Elm Street "). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What does one do is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes since McAdams interacts with either 4 or 5 people or by phone. She is a natural one. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in a seemingly random situation, the movie experiences a true escape. Watching the two yuppie types flirt while the audience knows something bad is brewing, filming is intriguing! The airplane boarding sequence is fascinating and the more than 30 minutes on board are excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven lets us guess about the involvement of others and whether anyone will come to their rescue. As with many thrillers, there will only be a crash during the climax when the lamb is turned into a superhero. An interesting plot makes us believe that little Rachel has the frustration she needs to get through this, but we can not help but flinch. The most overpriced scenes include angry hotel guests, an annoying passenger, Cillian's injury, and FX in the hotel. The strength of the film lies in the character development and in psychological games between the leads. Unfortunately, the good screen veteran Brian Cox is not sufficiently busy, but overall this is a thriller above average thrilling, which is worth seeing for all but the finale.
