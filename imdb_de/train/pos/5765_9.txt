Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre. As I understand from the commentary and the things I've read, it was made during the mid-west flood in 1993, when half of Missouri was underwater. Buildings were under water. Cars and houses were under water. An article said that zombies and the crew from this film would help to sink the river after firing every day. The fact that this movie was made at all is a miracle. It's like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made by a troma filter. It's a party movie you can enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and dumb characters. And it's fast and energetic and really funny. <br /> <br /> A toxic accident in a nuclear power plant causes people to collapse or become zombies. The local government covers it, demolishes the factory and builds houses over it. Due to some soil changes (?) A cave opening develops, and some new inhabitants find the cave and unleash the undead in the newly built community. From there it just gets crazy and bloody and funny. <br /> <br /> I read these reviews a few times. And it seems to me obvious that the same person has attacked this fun little movie three times as another reviewer with fake names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It is raw. It has something bad acting. So do half of the films. There is much worse than this funny movie. If you hate this movie so much, do not buy it. No personal attacks are required and the crew has to be called "Trailer Trash". And it's obvious you're not from Australia or England. It's just amazing that this great service, the IMDb, is not caught by people who use it just to destroy others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind. I give myself both bad and good reviews. However, it is painfully obvious that a fool would like to use this forum to personally attack the director of this film. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "reviewers" actually sue their "review" just to promote their own films. This film was called Boring - well, love or hate, you can NEVER say that this film is boring. It moves fast and never has a boring spot. Oh and this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? Um - LIAR. They tried to post the same review on Amazon and they tore it there. The same report just said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense has to stop. Love it or hate it - give it a real review or do not enter anything. It's obvious you did not see the movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record I have and although this is not nearly the best I've ever seen, it's far from the worst. And even the worst, I would give a real REVOEW and not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review helps some people to look through the stupidity that goes on here.
