He has glorified himself as a great supporting actor in "Glory", proving that he was not a moderate "Malcolm in the Middle" in "Malcolm X". He showed his fraternal love for "Philadelphia" acting "He Got Game", he did not hit us and made us sway like a hurricane in "The Hurricane", he effectively trained us on Training Day and now he has he demonstrated that he can also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This tears-maker fish story is unrelated to the Miami Dolphins debacle in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the 2002 final game. In contrast to this dolphin tragedy, Antwone Fisher has an emotional joyful conclusion. The film is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem because he was despicable as a foster child. Denzel plays the marine psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his birth mother. Derek Luke's Antwone debut is the best admirable acting I've seen in recent years by a new actor. In fact, I have seen some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's drama, as I saw in Washington's past performances. It was as if Washington would tell Luke: "la la la Luke, I am your deputy father." OK! I'll drop the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a distant galaxy. Speaking of Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting "Master D" himself? "Antwone Fisher" was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he put into the script of his story was "Fisher King" material. Greetings to the boss `Mr. Washington catches the right bait in Antwone Fisher. ***** Excellent
