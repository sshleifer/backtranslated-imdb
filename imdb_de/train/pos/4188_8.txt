Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, especially because he had very uneven politics in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisy and madness of America and "The Big Red One" was a powerful portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrills Marauders" painted the war as necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street "" is about the dangers of communist spies, and all of his films make for a very entertaining reputation, and although Fuller was often put in a drawer as a B-filmmaker, he was as good as any of the great studio entrants. "Pickup on South Street." no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film's style is remarkably ahead of its time - it's also a very fast, tight and occasionally brutal film noir. <br /> <br /> The acting all along the line is fantastic, Richard Widmark is a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is pretty sexy as a girl working for her communist espionage lover, but the show stealer is Thlema Ritter in an absolutely e ntsch√ºckenden performance as a police tool. The angles Fuller uses are great, making the drama sequences all the more exciting and brutal (this is very violent at the time). The camera moves continuously, as does Tarantino and his school forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action thriller. "Shock Corridor" is still my favorite Fuller movie, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
