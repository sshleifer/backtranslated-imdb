I was only born 4 years after the first broadcast of this wonderful show, but luckily I managed to catch the mid-90s repeats, and the rest is history. I was excited. The premise was pretty simple; The two hardened nemesis agents Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) work with an experienced (though not young) physician and biologist (Sharron Macready) to find a dangerous biological agent behind the bamboo curtain through red porcelain , As they flee, their aircraft is hit by a machine-gun fire and crashes in the heart of the Himalayas, where their lives are rescued by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that heals and enriches the trio's senses, creating a setting for many exciting adventures. that will come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 hours and I think it was relatively short-lived, for one season it has made a cult status. <br /> <Monty Berman, the producer, was known to make things as cheap as possible, and sometimes the show suffered from unbelievably cheesy sets - especially in episodes like "Happening" (a studio that represents the Australian Outback ) and the 'snow' phrases from "Operation Deep Freeze" and "The Beginning", but if you can get past it and focus on the characters and storylines, the show was really a lot of fun. It was a great mix of adventure and a lot of dead humor (mainly from some great liners by William Gaunt). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three leads was fantastic - it feels like they really were. It was a lot of fun doing the show, and this is made clear in the 2005 Reunion documentary The three of them reunite after 35 years to remember the show (and laugh at Anthony Nicholl's awful wig !!). They all shared the same screen time and everyone had their moments lit up. I have to say, I've always been a fan of Richard Barrett - I loved his sardonic humor along with this dangerous advantage - he was certainly a man you did not cross and those eyes ... the blueest eyes you would see probably watch on TV. I also followed Bill Gaunt's career with interest. However, Craig Stirling would certainly have had his legion of female fans, and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo also had quite a few male fans who went over them. <br /> <br /> The show also featured a host of guest stars including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. Notable episodes for me were: "Auto Kill," "The Questioning," "The Fanatics," "The Mission," and "The Gilded Cage," but I'm sure everyone has their personal favorites Has. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this show for the first time, or if you want to revisit it after many years, remember to consider it in the context of the time it is in and just sit back and enjoy it - the characters and the chemistry of the three main points make this wonderful show I and I do not think I'll ever get tired. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
