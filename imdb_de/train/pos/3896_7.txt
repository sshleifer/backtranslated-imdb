Some people loved "The Aristocrats" and others hated it when they often went in the middle. The reactions to Eddie Izzard are probably not that extreme - if you're dealing with a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and have a vocabulary that makes the "f" word of his program sufficient, it would be a long beep, though he is shown on the network television. Many fans of Izzard are so devoted that they see no flaws in his performances. On the other hand, I found this show occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest, but also mostly funny and in some places absolutely funny. He has a way to link references from routines at the beginning of the show to his later routines. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joke maker. He is not a frenetic fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, some of which work and some - a routine with the San Francisco Cable Car and Alcatraz for example - are totally out of round. However, he has a way to gently move past the routines and expand those connecting. I gave this performance a 7 and could be persuaded to raise it to an 8. But a 10? Under no circumstance.
