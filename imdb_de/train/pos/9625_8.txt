When you first watch this movie, it's hard to know what happened, but when you look at it, it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was superb in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing, first she wanted to trap Bob, but I really think she loved him, even though she had broken his heart at the time. The performance of Dean Cain was usually excellent. He gets better with every movie. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was up to the viewer to decide
