Only the second time, two years later, did I realize two things in this film: 1) I enjoyed it very much and 2) because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself justifies. I had laughed through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests - talent spokes and loogies and air proximity (even * good * -natural air proximity) just are not inherently funny, especially if they are designed for the length of the movie. However, as the movie fades towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of odd timing that even the awkward scripts (eg Ted (a certain resident not recognizing hell) work as effortlessly as the others (eg the challenge) and the interplay of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the interplay of Bill and Ted (who throughout the movie spend only one scene separately, a disaster, if they are not well matched) completely unrestricted. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found that the first film is only sporadically entertaining - there are seemingly different strange sensations.) I give him one 7.75 Surprisingly much fun.
