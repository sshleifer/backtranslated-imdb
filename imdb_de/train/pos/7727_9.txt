FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema. What makes him a great movie is his sense of wonderment. Once the spaceship lands, the audience travels - through the human crew of ships - through an intelligent and sometimes frightening adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we learn of the former inhabitants of the earth - the krell, which died out overnight. Or do you <br /> <br /> You can say with a nod that the planet was obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops, but that adds to the sense of claustrophobia that I feel and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron Adds More Atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this movie is not in the top 250 IMDB movies.
