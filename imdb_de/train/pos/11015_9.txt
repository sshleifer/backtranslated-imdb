This film is directed by Renny Harlin, the Finnish wonder. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct action films. Stallone needed that role to get back on track. Snowy Mountain is a very good place for action movies, and who can film better where there is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than a Finnish man. Action is good! The music in the movie is spectacular. The villain is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker, The Janine Turner. It is placed in a nice place and it is a very exciting movie. Overall good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special collector's edition, with good extras. Soon in Finland directly to the video.
