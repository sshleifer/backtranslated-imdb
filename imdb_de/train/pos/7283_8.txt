I love to buy these cheap, lousy DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I bought this here. It's the perfect stupid sci-fi movie of the 50s, all playful. It's full of unscientific ALL, little dressed girls and a lot of melodrama. It's an enjoyable movie for anyone who appreciates this stuff. And if you can suppress your disbelief enough, you can actually crawl out - not just by the psychotic head or by hitting the thing in the closet, but towards the end with the character of the "perfect body." , It is so . , , , what is another word for mindf *** ing?
