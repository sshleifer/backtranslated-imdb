I love Tudor Chirila and maybe I liked the movie so much. Two days before the movie premiere I visited his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I had everything in my head ... I was wrong: Instead of a good movie I did a great assist! I felt the film. it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it made LOVE .. i can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so i will not :) i am not a movie critic .. i can 'i describe it in more Words .. My vaguely vague description is all because the game has made me speechless .. Thank goodness for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, Thank you Maria Popistasu, Thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
