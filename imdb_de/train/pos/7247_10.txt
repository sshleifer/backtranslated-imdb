Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini and Alicia Moro (two stars from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD.) Who wants to forget dark shadows, has existed.) There is no music on the opening credits in Thorn's EMI video ... but The music is great as soon as it comes in. In the Italian films, the movies are not so good the music ... my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following the lonely alien through the desert. Alien says, why are you following me? tommy answers, because I feel like that ... alien answers, in which direction are you going tommy? says West, then Alien says alright, I'm going east. After a while of walking, the subject playing alien in the background looks up and sees Tommy sitting on a rock caressing a hamster ... Tommy looks up and says to Alien, what took you so long ... I love this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robotic arm needs a dad and alien is drafted to be Tommy's dad in the desert. , , Oh yes, they also need water. , , not THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2), but a stupid western / post-nuke movie with a robotic arm boy and Alien and Trash and a few other goodies with a horny chick with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL looking like that like Wez in the Road warriors. , On Sunday afternoon on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA) I came home to church and found this. , , frequently . , , too often. Love it. 10/10
