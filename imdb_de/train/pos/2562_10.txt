This is one of the biggest love movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts look outdated, but that does not detract from the movie. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy every art form from the perspective of time. At the Sex in the City standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. But when he judged from the perspective of the America of 1925, he was fantastic. Likewise, Sayonara is a groundbreaking film in its view of mixed race love, American arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It's a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just a social comment, but entertaining and enjoyable, with countless lines that you just can not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even if it is only considered a love story is terrific. Although some Brandos attack accents, it is best in nuance and characteristics. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the minor cast contribute a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the true star, does a great job of feeling the passion for Brando. while she is torn by her sense of commitment and loyalty. Her speech, when she met and talked to Brando for the first time, is a classic and something that is rare in the cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in their locker room in Tokyo at the end of the film is just as good. Of course, it does not have its mouth shut, spit and worse, which is what love in today's films exemplifies, but that makes it all the better. It shows true love and passion and not just "warmth". If this movie does not touch you, you're just too young, too cynical or dead.
