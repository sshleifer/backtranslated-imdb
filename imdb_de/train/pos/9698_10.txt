I have seen this movie several times and I do not understand why some people compare it to BABE. This movie is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can talk secretly. Instead, it's a parrot that learns to speak to help its owner, a serious-stuttering little girl who has overcome her speech weakness, only to be separated from her in a heartbreaking scene. Then the big journey begins. Paulie, the parrot, sets out to find his only great friend Marie. Along the way, he meets some wonderful people and many evil people. He falls in love with a parrot girl and loses her. He is involved in a criminal life and then captured by a nasty scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a compassionate janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his lover Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines as a friendly caretaker who is outgoing and generous and who, despite the risks, wants to help little Paulie. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the parrot AND one of the dodgy characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a small suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most children and even more so if the parents join in the fun and watch too. It's a fun, clever, epic animal adventure story, and ultimately a great love story about a bird and its little girl. The search for Marie ends with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about Parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the wild Green Parrot tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will benefit most from seeing this movie and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children everywhere will see that pets themselves form deep bonds and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to cherish. <br /> <br /> So no BABE here, rather an incredible trip with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear yourself during the sad parts.
