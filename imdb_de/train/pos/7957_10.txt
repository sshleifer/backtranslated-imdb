Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I've been searching for these two films for a long time and can not find them anywhere in my environment. (I am Australian). Could you please help me and tell me where to buy it? In general, Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are suitable for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie, I was 5 years old and still is when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My entire family loves this movie, apart from my younger sister, because I've seen him so many times that she's tired of it. I love this movie and I can not wait to buy it back on DVD. Sally. <br /> <br />
