I usually do not like series. They are all too predictable and tend to get boring and boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> However, these series are well-played, the story goes on in all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still catch you. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed in a hospital, and they continue to lead you to the secrets of dark and ancient secrets that lie just below the surface of the mighty hospital.
