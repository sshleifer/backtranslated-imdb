Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been best friends for ages and after graduation they decide to travel to Thailand. Following an incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to travel with him to Hong Kong. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are confused with drug smuggling heroine and put in jail. Now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. This was a pretty good movie, I've seen it a couple of times and after a while, you realize it's a few holes in the plot, but the movie keeps you entertained anyway. Claire Danes did a great job as always, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
