The original DeMille film was shot in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good movie. Hollywood's love for remakes brings us a pretty interesting movie with Yul Brynner. He was brilliant, of course, as he almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. The film, however, was a bit long in some places. It does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. Nevertheless, it is a funny movie that should be seen at least once.
