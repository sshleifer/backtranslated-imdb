I just want to say that this may be biased as I'm producer of the movie. However, I will maintain a certain sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, performs outstandingly as Jeff Grinderlin, a hypochondriacal nebbish, who is more concerned than alive. He gives his character a certain touch that really allows the audience to connect with him by expressing his mind often and with a sense of hard comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant support beam without which he would crumble himself. His friends also help in Jeff's life and often make decisions for him instead of using his free will ... what he often neglects is there anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is superb and the conversation flows like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie with half as many Ben Affleck Booo-Ho festivals. <br /> <br /> The camera work is a bit modest in some places, and the sound could also use a boost, but the performances shine in the smaller details. Behind the scenes stands a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an extraordinary composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a treat. A rare jewel among many jewels.
