Fabulous costumes by Edith Head, painted at Liz Taylor at its finest! <br /> <br /> The SFX are very good for a movie of their age, and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors, even to the body type, a rarity in films of this vintage. <br /> <br /> A cozy movie with great panoramas - even if it is chopped off for scanning and panning.
