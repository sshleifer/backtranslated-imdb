Just a comment on the accents in New Orleans ... <br /> <br /> A previous reviewer stated, "This movie might have been filmed in New York or another northern city because it talks to us characters, they speak more like "broklynese" than maybe a southern accent that you could hear in this part of the country. "There was also another comment in that direction from an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans actually sound "broklynese". I never found out why. (It's mentioned in John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces.) I'm always happy to see films in New Orleans containing this detail, like this one. Too often, it's just the Hollywood version of the southern standard accent.
