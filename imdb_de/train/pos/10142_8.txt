Maybe it's just that I have a strong fear of hospitals and medical supplies, but it got under my skin (forgive the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to excel and as satisfying as revenge movies. Not only did I feel a great deal of hatred for the screwdriver and a lot of sympathy for the "Screwee", I felt cramped at certain times and had disgusting feelings, what a somewhat blunt horror viewer really is a rare and delightful thing to myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but are more tribute than imitation. It's a heavy piece that does not give the viewer much to think about, but I enjoy being attacked by a movie from time to time. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I really liked that. DO NOT watch while you eat pudding.
