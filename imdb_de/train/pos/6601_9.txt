This movie is absolutely stunning. A new Blade Runner - future Noir in its most difficult form. The vision of Paris is magnificent, both recognizable and visionary, with far-reaching prospects, playful standards and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, with a few surprises, but I do not like that about the movie. It's a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Rendered in 3D and rendered in black and white (with no shades of gray!) with just a short spot of color, it's not as hard on the eyes as it sounds. There are many "arty" camera shots - close-ups and odd points of view - but that adds to the movie's temperament. Overall, one has the impression of a graphic novel in film material form. <br /> <br /> I initially had the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such as the level of animation and the detail of the figure's facial expressions. Unlike "A Scanner Darkly," which suffers from (or even intensifies) inconsistent character definition (pay attention to how some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistently consistent and precise. When the character is in close-up, added details and texture can be seen, but if in the center of the image or farther away, details are omitted, but not to the detriment of the character definition. <br /> <br /> For me: The only downside of the movie is that a comment says it's a one-time project. Such a shame, because I would like to see more of this futuristic film noir story and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is great, too. All in all a great movie and highly recommended.
