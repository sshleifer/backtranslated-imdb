Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it does offer some of the best melee sequences in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh does what many see as his masterpiece. This movie started the careers of the five men who play the poisons. Meng Lo is still playing a bad ass. He would continue to be in super ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, would go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Every chop-socky fan can recognize this. But I still do not find it as good as Super Ninjas (also by Chang Cheh). But all chop socky is good and that's one of the best.
