Unlike many other films that are disruptive either because of their naked discomfort (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah movies), the liberation shakes plausibility. Surely the buggery scene is rather uncomplicated in its inconvenience, but the effect of the movie is much more due to the slow accumulation and the noticeable sense of isolation around the four tracks before and after everything goes awry. The moment when the canoes pass by on the bridge under the child, who does not even acknowledge or even show any human affection for the men with whom he had previously played music, is one of the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily during the canoe tour and persists even after the credits. The end makes the meaning of the agonies of the characters terribly real. The plausibility of the film is greatly supported by the playing of the leads, especially by Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as victims or reluctant heroes. Burt Reynolds has never been better. The cultural influence of the film can be demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to the "banjo territory" - perhaps only Carter has done such an effective job in the tourism industry of a region. I can only imagine a handful of films that have put me into such a severe depression after graduation - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can imagine. Although so much of itself is outstanding, Deliverance is above all a classic because there are not enough benchmarks - it is unique.
