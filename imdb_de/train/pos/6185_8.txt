I watched MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the recently released Universal Pre-Code Set and was amazed at how much I liked the car from start to finish. Most other commentators have reported the story, a murder mystery in a musical, but I wanted to add a few more comments. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively boring compared to most smaller players, and no one really seems to have the right voice for what he sings (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, Brisson is a bit shaky at some of his highs and low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie are playing well and have an excellent timing feel that keeps the ball between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls, but do not forget the great jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" number. Gail Patrick does one of her early gigs and sounds a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would later become the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there's Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe - you'll also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introduces the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet marijuana" with barely dressed peyote button girls in the background (blood dripping on the white skin of a choir cooled wonderfully); the "Ebony Rhapsody" with the Duke Ellington's Orchestra and a swarm of beautiful black and white dancers. And I think this is one of the few early musicals to offer such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to be desired.
