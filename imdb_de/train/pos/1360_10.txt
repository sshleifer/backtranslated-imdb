This is one of the most popular movies of all time. Parker Posey's character is extremely entertaining, and the librarian's motive is not lost to anyone who has ever worked in the book and pile worlds THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is also highly recommended. I have shown this movie to more library friends than anyone else - they all fall in love with it.
