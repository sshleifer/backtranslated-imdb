The corridor of roses. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A blend of old western and hip hop, perfectly connected. The clothing styles, scenery and plot are exactly what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy - in five years they robbed 27 banks and disappeared without a trace. Now a small town in the west is besieged, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to go again. And this time it's personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women who split up after five years together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she once again collects her friends and rides on a trail of revenge. <br /> <br /> A good version of Western. (If you've seen bad girls, this is a bit better in the way of female characters.) <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, storyline, and scenery did it for me to have .
