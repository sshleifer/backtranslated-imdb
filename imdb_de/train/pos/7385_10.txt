To all who think 1. that was a boring television program. 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not earn their Oscars. <br /> <br /> SHUT THE F ** k UP !! This was one of the best Academy Awards, because 1. It was a moment in history that a black "black actress" could win an Academy Award for Best Actress, so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years. To be honest, because of the lack of diversity of winners or nominees, I did not have to watch the Academy Awards anymore. For me, it was nothing but a bunch of white people knocking on the back. The Academy had many chances to choose black actresses. These were brilliant films, such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, and Mary Jean Babtise, but it did not make Oscar a competitor that put the Academy under pressure for she chose so that the actresses were ignored by the actresses academy whose majority is composed of white voters yeah yeah Nicole Kidman sang very pretty in muling Rouge! But it was time that black people were housed in these awards. Like Mr. Washington, the Academy owed him great time after this unfair loss for MalcomX. For anyone who thinks that races are not a "likely white people" in the film industry, many of the most talented black actresses have either been reduced to stereotypical stereotypes I think is a black woman or existence "Angela Basset". I do not expect many of the whites to understand anything about it, because they never had to deal with anything about it. If you think about it, they are the ones who did it
