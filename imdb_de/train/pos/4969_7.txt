It is wonderful to see that Shane Meadows already has international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A RAOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the vague class identity working above, but far below the middle, the naked father, the deserted urban milieu, the sense of adult barely concealed fascism fails modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is a seasoned formalist, Mariage trades in pictures, and his coolly composed, exquisite surreal monochrome images serve to distance the grimy, rather gloomy motive that resembles Meadows in seconds from the high farce to the tragedy. <br /> <br /> There are longues and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is crazy, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realize them are dangerous. while single set pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions; The best wedding sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to wrest the epiphany of despair.
