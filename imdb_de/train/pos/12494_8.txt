Finally an indie movie that really scares you! I see most of the horror movies coming out ... movies, straight-to-dvd, cables etc ... and most of them are shit ... a few can be viewed ... even less are actually good .. Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I showed this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! Since there are no eponymous actors, I suppose the budget for this movie was pretty low, but you would not know ... the movie looks awesome ... acting absolutely works for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fear is great! While most filmmakers focus only on fear, they often forget the development of story and character, two things that help to make fear more efficient. Brian Avenet-Bradley needs to know that character and story are important. He develops both to the point where you take care of the characters, you know the characters and are therefore more afraid when in danger. <br /> <br /> You're watching horror movies that cost somewhere between $ 80 million and $ 5000 I think "Dark Remains" is one of the gems. Watch this movie!
