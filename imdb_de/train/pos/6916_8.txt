Winchester '73 was the movie that brought man out of the B films into the big league, and saved James Stewart's post-war career by throwing him as a conflict-ridden hero (though he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang had earned the thanks for that). Both men would go to much darker places - man with the remarkably gloomy Devil's Doorway, who was convicted by MGM of the success of Broken Arrow. But a movie about a man chasing his own brother while the rifle of the title is given person to person on the way before landing on a slope in one of the director's popular shooting practice is still more meat than it is The studio would expect system. Great dialogue, an impressive side cast? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson among them? and Mann's outstanding visual feel sets a new standard with this.
