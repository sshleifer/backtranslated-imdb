funny. funny. intelligent. ingenious. I mirrored the channels one night ago years ago. it struck and a wildfire began. I stayed up late every night and picked it up for anyone I know. a few. Like 3 out of the nearly 100 people I did, I did not think it was as great as me. The others laughed loudly, so much that they cried and thanked me at the same time. please do not run yourself a favor run look at this and enjoy it. Intelligence and humor. It's a win-win situation. I wish I could have an afternoon tea with him and meet the really rare comedian that we as a society need more ... sane chaos.
