If you want to see something that is "him" and "she," then this is the movie you need to pick. I'm a jerk for Rome coms, but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy !!!). Anyway, I managed to make him look, because I told him it was about sports, and you know what, he loved it !!! Drew Barrymore is very funny and her lead man (sorry but can not remember his name) is just as good. When I saw the movie he was called "The Perfect Match", but I think the title was changed for the UK because it's based on the book "Fever Pitch" and a movie about that title has been made (the same movie) but the UK version - Poof!), <br /> <br /> Anyway, all reviews on this page will tell you more details when you need them, buy girls, take from me, your husband / boyfriend before Turn on the TV on a Saturday night and you'll both laugh and cry together. A true gem.
