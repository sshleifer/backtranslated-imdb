I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, funny ... It makes no sense to report on the content of the film, because then I would publish the result! You have to see it without knowing what it's all about! Everything is connected and has its Why & Why. It starts subtly and then things roll faster and faster, until they come to an insane outburst that you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the movie for the second time once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie. He is one of the most original I have ever seen!
