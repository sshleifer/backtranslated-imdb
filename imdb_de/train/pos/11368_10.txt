A surprisingly complex and well-made study of serial killer "The First" in the USSR. In the days of perestroika, this intense piece comes to life with the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> Cicatillo's investigation of a murderer is well rounded and points to some of his behaviors. While others are shown to the right, there is a subtlety that captivates without being overtly graphic. Not for the faint-hearted, as the topic is often disconcerting, but is necessary for the full development of the main participants of this fact story. <br /> <br /> HBO has given us a great movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and publisher of this great piece. It's in my top 10 Must See list.
