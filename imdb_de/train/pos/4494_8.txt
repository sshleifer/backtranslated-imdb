As a native of Bolton, this movie has an obvious appeal for me. The footage is intriguing and shows a Bolton that is in a state of flux - there are a number of scenes of seeming slander, but this shows the rebuilding of the city - and the idea that the old must make room for the new lies in the heart of this film. A somewhat failed James Mason leads a pleasing ensemble in a story about a vortex around a herring that evolves into a full-fledged generational conflict, and then a pleasingly slender solution. Although I'm a bit too young to remember, the minutiae of Lancashire's life in the '60s is everything: a Friday is redeemed, songs on the piano, Sunday makeup, good-bye neighborhood, fears of courtship, the masses Importance of self-esteem, and I was glad that Naughton's funniest lines from the play remained intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be released on DVD - it is well made and most of the performances are well done.
