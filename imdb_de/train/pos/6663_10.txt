This movie is about a dysfunctional family, but not about some dysfunctional family. It is about the family of the father of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the foreign relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how The Mahatma M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to reach our freedom. Each time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son approached, the Mahatma came between them. This is a beautifully made movie. Akshaye Khanna has proven to be a top actor. He naturally expressed feelings. Darshan Jariwala, who plays mainly in Plays-Gurukant Desai's law firm in Guru, wonderfully portrayed Gandhi (as a real man, unlike Ben Kingsley, who made him look like a god) to show how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son , This film is touching and so the soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" is sung in a unique way. I saw this movie just three hours ago (it was released a day earlier in Dubai - on the 2nd). When the movie was over there was "Pin Drop Silence" and when leaving the theater no one else pushed (Can you imagine that? We Indians are not pushing?) NOT ONE! There was a holy silence ...
