I watch this movie all the time. I've seen it with families from 3 to 87 years old and everyone in between; Everyone loved it. It really shows the true scenes of a dog and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for men who love comedy movies, tear films or just pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes really thought out and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters is the true and beautifully mixed personality: Shadow (the oldest, a golden retriever) He is the wise man, filled with the wisdom and mindset of every dog ​​a funny side, the funny character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan Cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for her owner, the real girl.
