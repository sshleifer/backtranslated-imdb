A young lawyer was sent to a remote area to handle the estate of a recently deceased client. When he arrives, he realizes that he is not liked by the villagers and that his deceased customer was not liked. To speed things up, he decides to move out of the local inn and settle in her home, a house that is usually foggy and can only be reached via a dam that is blocked from the sea for most of the day. Wherever he sees visions of a woman in black, she is real or conceited, he is also exposed to the bloody sounds of a child and a child who seems to drown in the marshes. Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous piece by Susan Hill, which it applies for the first third of building its characters before moving into the spooky country house. His small color contrasts immediately give away his TV roots. But as a ghost story, it had some disquieting moments, though, after waiting so long to see that I was sadly a little under-challenged.
