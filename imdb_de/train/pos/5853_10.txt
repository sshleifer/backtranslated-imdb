I really liked this Summerslam because of the look of the arena, the curtains and the overall look. Anyway, this could have been one of the best Summerslam events, if the WWF had not had Lex Luger against yokozuna in the main event. Now it was okay to have a huge, fat man against a strong man, but I'm glad the times have changed. It was a terrible main event, just as every game Luger plays in is terrible. Other games included Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening. This was the event when Shawn called his big monster a bodyguard Diesel, IRS against 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart meets Doink, then Jerry Lawler, and the stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting. Then Ludvig Borga demolished Marty Jannetty, the Undertaker entered another terrible fight against Giant Gonzalez. The Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger. This match was boring and has a terrible ending. However, it earns 8/10
