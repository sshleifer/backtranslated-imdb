Resident Evil: Code Veronica is a great, well made video game. It has great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great storyline and a high fun factor. The plot is Claire Redfield, who is taken to an island to invade Umbrella grounds, and the Reaking Chaos in her main lab, looking for her brother. The graphics of Code Veronica are very good, the fire and rain effects look great. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not fit the Dreamcast control, which makes it hard to get used to. It's still fun to walk around in a strange, disturbing place and shoot the entrails out of zombies. Code: Veronica also has a bit of "romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield of Resident Evil 1 For example, the sound in this game is better than ever, even if I hate the new feature. When the giant spiders crawl, they make a disturbing, crackling sound with their feet, and the cannons sound much more realistic. Great graphics, outstanding story, comfortable controls and Reali Stic Sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica definitely loved it. I give 10 out of 10 points.
