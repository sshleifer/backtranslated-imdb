In the aftermath of Bill and Ted's stellar adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future when evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as Bill and Ted to kill the humans Bill and Ted change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy combo, Winter and Reeves deliver delicious humor to the audience in this entertaining sequel. Although Bogus Journey does not have the edge of the first one, he still has the big buzzwords and dialogues of the leading couple, not to mention a jolly performance by William Sadler, who gives the character of the deep, the Grim Reaper, a humorous side. Pay attention to the game sequences, the best moment in the entire movie, but one of the many great techniques to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is still full of humor, this movie has a more dramatic movie. Missions are more serious and situations riskier. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another endearing function. The creators also extend the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, where hell and heaven are strongly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is just right again with the use of this amazing time trial machine, though in some places it is somewhat confusing with the use of timing and the fact that objects and situations occur in the present, as in the last few years Case is scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch that I hated this sequel was a real pleasure, as I appreciated the jokes and the story more and although the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor. Bogus Journey has enough good motives, jokes and a pretty quiet plot to make a good-natured family movie.
