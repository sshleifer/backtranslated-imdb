This was Keaton's first film and is actually three shorts that are located in different epochs (Stone Age, Roman, Modern) on the eternal triangle of Romanticism. The stories are similar to Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which was meant to satirize. The strengths of the jokes and gags are almost all dependent on anachronisms and bring today's business into ancient environments. > <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using a turtle as a small board (Stone Age); A wristwatch with sundial (roman time); A car with spare wheel (Roman time); Use of a helmet as a tire barrier (Roman period); Early golf with rackets and rocks (Stone Age); Dictating a will hewn into a stone (Stone Age); The changing weather forecasts (Roman time); The chariot race in the snow - Buster with skis and sled dogs with a replacement dog in the trunk of the car (roman time). <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned disposable gags keep us laughing. However, there are also some memorable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster takes out shaving gear to make up girls; The fantastic twofold sensation as a drunken buster looks at his plate to discover a crab staring at him (within a second he leaps from his seat to his chair and jumps back into the waiter's arms - one of the funniest) moments I have ever seen). And this lion - the manicure - just awesome. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of racism when four African-American throwers leave their mistress for a Roman crap game. <br /> <br /> Cinema's print is a bit blurry and contains many sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage - most likely at the end of the reels. The Metro feature features piano and flute and is heavily borrowed from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Have fun and laugh a lot.
