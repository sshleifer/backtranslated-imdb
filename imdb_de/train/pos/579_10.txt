In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives in Provo, Utah, near Sundance. I like most of the work and that was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it appeared on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after watching the movie together. The movie and the book hit an emotional point in my heart, and after seeing the movie, I cried for a few days. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories persist across generations. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was impressed with her beauty and how well she brought to life the words of the author of the book Norman Maclean: "But when I am alone in the half-light of the gorge, all existence appears with my soul and my memories fade into a being, and the sounds of the Big Black Foot River and a four - stroke rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise up, finally, all things unite into a river and a river flows through the river World intersected and runs from the cellar of time over rocks, on some rocks are timeless raindrops, under the rocks are the words and some of the words are their, I am persecuted by the water. "These words taken from the book and in the end of the movie (by Robert Redford, narrated as Norman Maclean), in my opinion, are essentially a scripture passage. Possible mistakes of the film are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was wonderful!
