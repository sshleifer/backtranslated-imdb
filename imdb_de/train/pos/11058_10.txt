I would say this is the first high-quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who would end up together, there was still yearning and anticipation. the thought that they might not get together ... it's an indie movie. This movie was well written, directed and played. The dancing on the street side was great.
