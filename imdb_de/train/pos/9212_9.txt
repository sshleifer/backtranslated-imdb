Yesterday I went to the cinema alone, because in Mexico mostly films from other countries are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). After watching this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are an alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I liked this movie so much ... that in the end I was happy. This movie is a little hopeful spoon these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the good music. Especially the main song of the movie. !!
