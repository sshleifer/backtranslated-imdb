Why did not the producers of this show give a chance? Why did not the producers give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I would like to see how it ends. Video the first season and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees, waiting for my return. I have set my recorder to record all shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and the heart is broken. I wish I knew it would be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was going to deepen somewhat in the characters. The writing was pretty good, too. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my absolute favorite. I'm so sorry to see it!
