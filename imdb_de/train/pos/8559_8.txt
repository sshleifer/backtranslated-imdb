There is a certain genius behind this film. I laughed everywhere. The scene in the phone sex office, which discussed how love heals the doppelganger, was a nice try of this genius. The execution is bad, but you can see the author's message and you have talent. The doppelganger split in the end was like ... "ok, did not quite expect, but let's see what the movie has to say". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea, which in a strange way is really very coherent. <br /> <br /> Is the sense of a movie logical or is it entertaining or communicating emotionally? I'm getting bored with a lot of movies, but this one has caught my interest. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some autobiographical roots, but that's just a guess. Terribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other films that person may have made (with more experience).
