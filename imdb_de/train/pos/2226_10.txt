I'm surprised that IMDb rated the movie so badly. With all due respect, the low rating stands for the IQ level of those who rate it as bad. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception of the people is that this is a horror movie. It is not, and the film does not lead you to believe that it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It is intended for people who really want an intellectual experience watching a movie. The review by Reel.com is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews make little sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original film for a change - very rare these days - something bad and not worth it. It does not make sense. Martha brainwashed and experimented to be a caring mother while she was really a nasty Nazi who would kill without warning. The proof is all in the pudding and the fact that at first glance we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster, because the film is proof of the direction and writing of the film for the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should be rated at least in the 6s, at least in terms of originality. I recommend this movie to the people on the other end of the IQ scale - also known as smart people - because this movie is obviously slaughtered by those who would rather see Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. Kudos for acting too. With such a low-budget movie, you wonder why this movie did not hit your local cinema with its great direction, writing, and acting. Please do not be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. I recommend actually buying the film, because a first look at a loan does not live up to this claim.
