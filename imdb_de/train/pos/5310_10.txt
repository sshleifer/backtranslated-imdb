Pecker is another mainstream movie by John Waters, which was shot on a smaller than Serial Mom. The title character of Pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of everything he sees. It does not matter if it's dirty or shocking when taking pictures. Soon he uses the pictures taken and displays them in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal family from the middle class. His father works in a drink bar with a claw machine, but does not earn enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street. His mother runs a junk shop and loves to put on poor people. His older sister Tina works in a gay bar specializing in commerce. His younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sugary food. His grandmother Memama has a small statue of the Virgin Mary playing with her ventriloquist. He also has 2 friends. One of his friends, Matt, is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat like a dictator. Soon a tourist from New York buys his pictures and shows them in an art gallery. The picture becomes famous, but the pictures show the unusual lifestyle of the simple life of his friends and his family. For an R-rated movie, Pecker is safer than most Waters Waters movies and pink flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
