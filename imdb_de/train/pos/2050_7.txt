Everyone has bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group a soldier discovers the war is over and returns home to see a number of prisoners of war, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight and a short massacre later. Walken and a Colombian guy shared a dollar bill that promised something. <br /> <br /> Cut to the Present (1991), and the Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. At first he succeeds, but after El Presidente threatens to destroy people with a tank, he has to surrender and be shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full detail as a news broadcast on American television, which causes Walken to put together the old squad (even though he did not initially belong to the squad) to raid Colombia and downsize thousands of soldiers. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumentally stupid movie, but it's still a good laugh and full of action. This is one of those movies where logic goes a long way - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot from another plane in the head without suffering decompression or even breaking a window? It also appears that these guys can shed dozens of drug dealers in New York without the police taking care of it and forgetting about the heroic but utterly meaningless death of one of the heroes who split the confrontation between Walken and El Presidente we do not see the passionate speech of the rebel leader's sister seen on television in America (almost brought) a brown tear in my under-eye, that bit. <br /> <br /> It's out there for a pound. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can see the camera crew.
