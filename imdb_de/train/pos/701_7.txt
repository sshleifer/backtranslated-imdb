I did not know where to go unless I think it was much better not to have exempted much. Do not get me wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and author. I think she deserves a lot of kudos for this movie. It can be said that it was a love act for her. The acting (outside of Dominic) is a bit cheesy and the quality of the film is not great, but for a really cheap movie it's good. There have been times when history has devoured, and there are parts that are protracted, though I do not think that greatly affects the ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say, go away. The gag role was fun, I will not ruin it, but there is a certain scene that makes it worth buying the DVD so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a movie also shot by Jagged Edge. I know that fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
