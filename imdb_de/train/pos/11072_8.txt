it's all very easy. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with the cheater and the chess masters. They will be compassionate about his story of the loss and failure and misery he is living because of his belief in mastering the little tricks and controlling the rules of the little crooks. They decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his innermost fears, from what he considers to be his own. For this, they take him on a journey where he has to let go of all the fears, all the pride, all the hope to be reborn as the true master of his will, the journey of enlightenment, the infinite gambling and games that we play with and in make ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
