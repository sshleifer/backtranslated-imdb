Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic murderers Columbo has ever had to deal with. And the plot is completely ingenious. This is one of the best Columbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent supporting roles. And Peter Falk delivers a bit more in his scenes with Gordon.
