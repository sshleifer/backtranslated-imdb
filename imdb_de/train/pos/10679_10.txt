The man over the house is a true sitcom in the truest sense of the word. The comedy is about a character named Robin Tripp (played by Richard O 'Sullivan), who finds herself after a wild party and ends up with two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to say goodbye to her old roommate. The obvious happens when he moves in. <br /> <br /> The man in the house was a precursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin-off show George and Mildred, in which the two characters, the landlords of Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters actually turned out to be the linchpin of the man in the house, with Mildred (the late and much-missed Yootha Joyce) above all receiving some of the best lines in the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always on the watch and came only when he wanted to borrow (and never wanted to return). <br /> <br /> The Americans did this A version called Three's Company, but has no chance compared to this much weirder original. Thames took a risk when he made a comedy about a man who shared a flat with two women in a very conservative time, but they should be worried as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to see an old-fashioned piece of comedy inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity that modern comedy can not reach this high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on network DVD
