FREDDY has gone from creepy to funny in this episode of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It's been 2 years, actually 11 years, since this film took place in 2001. And FREDDY has killed every last child on Elm Street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from Part 5, even though the movie gives a clue who he is), in which he brings more children to get to Elm Street. Not only does Freddy get his wishes, but he also gets his daughter goes back to Elm Street. When she finds out what's happening, she and other kids decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We also see some of the scary backgrounds of FREDDY. Rachel Talalay, who had been involved with the Nightmare series for a long time. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He's been trying to figure out what FREDDY did to his Wisecrackes ... COMDEY and makes the show more fun than weird. So this movie is really a sore thing to talk about. It's not the wind in the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
