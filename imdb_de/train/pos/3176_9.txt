I happened to see this movie at a show in Brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; It has a lot of crazy characters, but let's just say it would be hard for me to decide which one made me laugh the most, I would not know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well played. <br /> <br /> There are numerous small details that make it unique and very enjoyable, there are a few "gadgets" that pop up and add another fun layer. It is refreshing to look at. not some recycled stuff I've seen many times. If this movie could reach a wider audience, it would surely be a crowd pleaser, the story is so original and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> There's a lot to like, funny background stories, mishaps and misconceptions that set the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a lot of heart. It's a touching story with a fast, thoroughly woven comedy. Definitely worth seeing!
