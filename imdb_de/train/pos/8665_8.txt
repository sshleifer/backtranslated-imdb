I have this title by chance with the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-Trash films. But this movie has a good stamp and should have earned a better transmission than what's out there. Stupednous is not it ... satisfying it is! When I saw this movie, I could not wonder ... how did it happen that Sergio Martino did not make this movie? This has his signature everywhere and is broken by Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately not as well known as she should be, but she got a nice cameo in Hostel II). Double crosses and triple crosses underpin and cement this film from beginning to end, with Lee Van Cleef cool under pressure from the first second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential, or did the studio system let this guy through? In addition to Lee's better-known films, movie-goers should try on this size and find out if Sergio Leone would have reduced his epic scale of Once Upon a Time in America to half the running time (and 1/4 of the budget). That's how it would turn out. So refreshing it should be taken at home during the day and used for a couch matinee
