My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life, she has seen only the walls of our house and her school, which is also occupied with other disabled children. I was the joke of all because my sister is disabled, and I still think today that nobody cares about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate and he had artistic abilities. my sister can go, but she can not speak a word and she can not use her hands to do anything except grab at things. But through this movie, I realized that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I saw SHAWSHANK !!! This film is seriously underestimated and should not. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. Think you can not write well? This guy has written with his foot. do not you think you are attractive? This guy was rejected because of his condition by many girls. not the fastest runner? Christy could not even get up. <br /> <br /> My point: Parents of young children, I suggest that your kids watch this movie with you so they know next time they see someone on the street in a street wheelchair, they stare Do not touch them as if they were aliens. My sister got millions of eyes and it breaks my heart to believe that this still happens to many people. This film will show people that people who do not seem "normal" are human, too. 10/10
