There is no perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. Ken Franklin, who represents the other half of the detective story writing team, does not know that. He kills his partner Jim Ferris, who wanted to go alone Columbo enters the picture and asks Mr. Franklin all sorts of questions. And he returns for another question. Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his days of glory. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look. It is hard to believe that this man could enlighten any crime. But he could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who could represent this character. Please no remakes. This part is a very good example of how Columbo works. Jack Cassidy plays the murderer and Martin Milner the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays Joanna Ferris, the wife of the victim. In the scenes between Columbo and her is something lovable. How does he make the omelet and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. Actually she's had a tragic fate when she died after a murder I've been a fan of Columbo since I was a kid, and I still enjoy watching her. There were many years off when they did not show Columbo stories, but now he's back. Back for another question.
