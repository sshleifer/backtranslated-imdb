As a prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure movie and a good story and two other brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can recommend this movie to anyone, even the slightest preference for romance and adventure , <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
