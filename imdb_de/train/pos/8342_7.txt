Pretty good romantic comedy, in which I do not think Meg ever looked nicer. All players have done a good job to keep the game alive. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician would even see a little monkey's finger, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... you can just totally forget the reality and have a good time. Beautiful movie. Damn, Meg is a baby, eh?
