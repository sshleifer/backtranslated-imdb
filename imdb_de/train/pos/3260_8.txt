People call it a comedy, but when I looked at it, I only laughed once. I think the problem is that I saw it for the first time when I was 14 and I was not old enough to understand that it was not meant to be taken seriously. There were some scenes that should be funny, but I was too interested in the characters to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that, despite some stupid mistakes, it's one of the most touching love stories you've ever seen.
