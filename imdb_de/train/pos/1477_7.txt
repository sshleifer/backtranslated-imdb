I saw this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I talked to my mother-in-law at the same time). Anyone can tell me what happened to her. I easily saw her husband hear someone talking to his wife in the bedroom, and then he opened the door, she's already dead. What happened to her? Did she kill herself? How could she arrange everything like the phone calls while she's at home when her husband talked to that weird admirer? Anyone can explain that to me please. I'm so curious !! (In the end I read that she suffered from a multiplication disorder). <br /> <br /> Thank you.
