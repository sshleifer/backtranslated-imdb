FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, most original and entertaining piece I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie by no means complies with the Hollywood standards or even a street-to-video movie fluff comedy with terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget, or anything else. <br /> <br /> however, what this film has is very original and a pleasing story that is obviously made by people who love to do it, and the enthusiasm of the whole cast and crew really breaks through their whole Budget and the theatrical consequences. <br /> <br /> To make a great movie, you need a huge budget or decent actors. All you need are original ideas and some passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> Simply the best movie ever made. I do not care how you get it, rent, order, steal, download, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hope you make a DVD version.
