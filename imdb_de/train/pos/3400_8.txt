Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he has died she is free - but she does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who escaped from a monastery to taste more of life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and marry. But he can not leave his past behind him and she can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> WAY transmitted romance full of hysterically bad dialogues and situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to perform well, but NOBODY could get away with some of their lines! In a way, it's a classic, though. It's recorded in a beautiful Technicolor shot (try to watch it on DVD), with each frame being breathtakingly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed up to the Ninth (even in the middle of the desert) and hysterical poses to show the clothes and their body. Boyer just walks around and looks battered (no shock there). Nevertheless, I was never bored. It was wonderful to watch and the incessant, stupid dialogue kept me in stitches. In the end, I almost fell out of my chair because I laughed so much! Now I love stupid romances and give them a lot of space, but really - that's incredible! It also takes only a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic I give this one 8. As a serious film - a 1.
