"Roman Troy Moronie" is my commentary on the film. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> This character really expresses Moron. A tough gangster who is unable to pronounce profane words. Well, it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet unable to express yourself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will be one of the greatest idiots in the history of film history. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a big comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. And so it is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I just like the fact that Moronie thought the film was "R" because he was not profane.
