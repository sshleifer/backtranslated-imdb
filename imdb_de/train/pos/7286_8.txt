I had a great time watching this picture and was surprised by the more learned features. First of all, the film is indisputably cheap with its carton sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very bad (the two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as a leading man), gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) to first-class Virginia Headh in the title role as a headless victim of her will for science and the arts the lustful passions of her fiance. However, the scripting is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a film of this kind. There are many questions about the role of science and medicine in our lives, and what their limitations are. This movie is in many ways a mind film. But do not be fooled too much with his true purpose. It's a grim story about a man obsessed with medicine and who wants to connect the head of his dead girlfriend with the perfect body to create the perfect woman for a man with the best in body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is the saxophone music, which resonates strongly every time the doctor scans the city for female beauties.
