The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic Western. The topic of genocide by buffalo slaughter is present in other films, but never so brutal. Robert Taylor's counter-role as an obsessed buffalo and Indian killer is his best achievement. In the fifties, your mom brought you and your friends into the saterday matinee, usually western or comedy movies. But then and now it was wrong to let a child watch psycho-dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to movies with repressed sexual sadism and violent racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why did Mom miss censoring these films? Because there were "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. However, the climate scene in The Last Hunt is as terrible as Vincent Pring's mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The White Buffalo mythology, part of the texture of this film, was later demolished by other films including The White Buffalo, starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson played Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large bison herd lives in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. In winter, hunger forces surplus animals from the park in Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by Idaho's Nez Perce Indians under US contract law, which preceded Lincoln's presidency. Linclon signed the congressional act, which approved the Continental Railway and started the buffalo slaughter.
