By the fourth of July, I had a really long vacation in 1994 - about 17 days in a row, which was two weeks paid holidays, weekends, and the vacation itself. I stayed in town during this time and spent a lot of time in my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I saw my parents' subway. I was watching a segment of X files when a program called Personal FX appeared. I was addicted immediately. I've always been fascinated by items in our home that came from my parents' family homes and relics of kinship relatives. I often wondered about their history, their value, etc. After my long vacation, I went into my house at lunchtime to get only Personal FX. I can remember an episode where co-presenter Claire Carter announced the apartment in New York where The Series was filmed, it was being renovated, and once it was said the renovation was over, Personl FX would be back go up in the air. <br /> <br /> That never did! Personal FX was the first and best of the collector shows. And it has disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later I am still sore. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, FX.
