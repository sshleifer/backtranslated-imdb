Although I live in Minnesota, I have recently studied in France and came across this bizarre jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, to say the least. A creative and unique film, which the different directors each interpreted differently than their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these little stories into an overall storyline, similar to Love Actually in 2003. However, this attempt makes the magic of each segment obsolete. If you believe it to be true and consider each of the short segments as your own individual film, the love stories together will convey a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes strikingly bizarre - often to the point of confusion - and every single segment can be hard to follow. However, for an observer who closely observes each segment, the short plotting lines become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost fascinating. They stay on the edge of the seat waiting for what comes next. The viewer asks: "Did that really happen?" but they are also satisfied that it actually happened. It is a kind of film in which the viewer can not really decide when he leaves the theater if he loved him or if he hated him. The first reaction is to look at it again and again just to see how these individual lives merge into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the range of people it can relate to. It contributes to the reality of the film - here the American tourists speak English, the Parisian French and so on. The number of people the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From the disease to the supernatural, the love of parents for the love of husbands, this film covers all the basics of romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and quirky way, each unique event somehow blends together to tell a story: all sorts, sizes, nationalities, and forms of love.
