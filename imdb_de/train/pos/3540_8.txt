I bought this game on behalf of Walmart. I am glad that I did it. It was very entertaining to listen to Sean Connery to play the game. I thought the graphics was the best I've ever seen in a remake of a movie / game. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper, I thought was too hard, was so frustrated that I have one and a half weeks not played the game. There were too many people who shot at you and nothing to hide behind, or life, in order to cope. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I have found no difference from non-upgraded equipment for upgraded, like buying a suit of armor upgrade did not seem to make the defense more or fills my survival knife stronger. I really liked the Q helicopter. I think the developers did a good job.
