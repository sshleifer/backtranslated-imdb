When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was the typical stuff of "charity". The longer the movie went, the more involved I became. Acting is great by both actors, the direction was great, the story unusual. My first eyes in my life for a movie. A real must for any serious Videoteque. 11 out of 10
