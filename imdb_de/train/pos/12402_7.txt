**Warning! Spoiler Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short is part one of two that explain the short part of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix came about. Since we already know the story, the plot itself is no surprise. and the short film is less entertaining than informative. But this is how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. The visuals are better than the average, and the generally cold colors support the purpose of the short ones. <br /> <br /> A few problems. The violence of the story is somewhat unfounded and, along with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenes), distracts her from the short film's narrative. In addition, the second part must be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite some problems, this short film serves its purpose. It would not have fit in style, content or expiration of the original movie. This is the perfect way to uncover the story. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good information. Could be said a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
