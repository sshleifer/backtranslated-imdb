It's always a nice surprise when a television-turned-movie like Little Richard gets entertaining. This is a very predictable film about the story of Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by an actor named Leon whom I've never seen but does a great job. As with most TV movies, this is a bit more tame than if it were for cinema, which is a pity, because I'm sure we could see a lot about Little Richard, which was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious garbage. This is the only thing that spoils the movie and ultimately spoils a promising career. All in all, this movie is good and acting is above average for a TV movie. 7 out of 10.
