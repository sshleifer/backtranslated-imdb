This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is hardly any dialogue, apart from the narrative; and the landscape and music complement each other perfectly. At first I did not connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until a friend (who also has red hair!) Pointed it out to me. It's almost an old-fashioned kind of children's animated animation like Shrek or Toy Story, etc., but I think young people should be more introduced to the beauty and wonder of nature that this movie certainly does. Maybe not the best movie of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing prospect for all ages - not just kids.
