The reason why people say this movie scared them is because she did it !! That is, the purpose of the film was felt by a few who saw it. When I saw this movie for the first time it scared me and I had to think about life and religion. This is not a bloody, scary movie, but the way you think it could be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. Of course, unbelievers will only talk about a science fiction movie. The truth is that this film is a must for your thriller collection, even if it is religious. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them and it's a must. I have never seen the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe it will continue where the movie ends.
