One would not believe that a Finnish director from Helsinki can not stage an American horror movie (especially a movie that is completely in a US prison). Look at this and prove yourself wrong! It was produced at least in the 80's and the movie was made on a budget that better suits a modern DIY TV commercial (something I believe that nowadays everyone would really notice that virtually everyone is paying $ 100m + for the budget) Action movies is used, which unfortunately dominate industry sense!) As the first major production of Mr. Harlin and the - at least what is considered today as outstanding -. I still think that the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more related to Stellan Stargaard's screen appearances (not to mention the overrated Mr. Bergman directing efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but that's really a jolt there Evidence that outside the US and Hollywood there is a real talent for film to see a movie in tension. Try it and watch this movie, even if you are not a horror fever. IMO is definitely worth it!
