As many know, Mexican cinema was very bad after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately in the late '90s and early' 21st century great films such as La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros and Y Tu Mamá También and course El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba appeared. El Coronel ... is a wonderful film that retells the classic story of Gabriel García Márquez, eliminating the magical elements of realism and replacing them with the rugged reality in Mexico, not just by people like the Colonel their pensions are waiting, but by more than half of the Mexican population living in total poverty. The characters of the film satirically depict classical characters found in Mexican society, such as the nationalist colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, the faithful ally, the tolerant and patient woman, the hidden gays, etc. Film is a must if you want to know more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to see a beautiful movie by one of the best directors in Mexico
