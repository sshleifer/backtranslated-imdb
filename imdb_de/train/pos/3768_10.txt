I realize that many people hate this movie, but I have to admit that it is one of my favorites. I like it better than its predecessor and I like it better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the people of history never give credit, much like Back to the Future, Time Travel is hard to write, and this movie included Time Travel and a spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex had the best performances in this film. They looked cooler, acted cooler. and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is also fantastic. The sets are pretty detailed and massive and it's hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two films. Teenage buds that can barely spell are not the genius of the entire franchise, making these two idiots bigger as the characters responsible for the entire utopian future of the earth. The costume design was great too. Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where they look like in Excellent Adventure rather than say FAGS! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is amazing, the score in particular. I could say so much about this movie because I love it. But this is one of the movies I grew up with, and every time I did it I liked it a lot, so I can understand why people hate it or just think that the Bogus compared to Excellent (which I by the way also love) <br /> WITH YOUR BATH SELF !!!!
