I just watched this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2001. The working title there was "Dog Days". The reaction of the audience was mixed. Some people found that graphic sex and realistic violence were too much for them. Others really appreciated how good this movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's like "happiness" with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is animal poisoning, a striptease from an elderly citizen, an orgy'esque bath in a mall, the intrusion of anal candles and the annoyance of mentally incompetent people to handle too much, then this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity from its most desperate and pathetic side. The banality of our existence is driven to our faces with the utmost joy. Seidl has no interest in saving humanity here. And why should he? This film offers excellence from everyone involved, is always interesting and probably the most intelligent social statement that has been made in film for some time.
