Sleepwalkers are creatures that let the human life force drain completely to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one who has to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He follows the likeable Tanya (girl Amick). Will she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a BIG horror movie. Fast, lots of blood and blood and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are many joke references for horror buffs (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought he could do "Return to the Blue Lagoon"), as well as Kirge and Amick. But I find this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> The film was written for the screen by Stephen King and is unbearably vague. The sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where are you from? Why is that called? Why does the son have to feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What are your powers? (At one point Krause lets a car go AND change color and style!)? Why do they have to feed the life force of humans? Why does it just have to be virgins? Why does the son have sex with his mother? Nothing is explained, the story confusing. It's too bad, because apart from these questions, this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent make-up and special effects. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and fun. If only the script would be better. It was also a pretty explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige edited (you can say) to get an R-rating. I can only give a 7
