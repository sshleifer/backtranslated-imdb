Although written by Stephen King, an overrated author, if ever there was one, this is actually a pretty entertaining B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures living in a candlelit house, draining the vitality of virgins, magnificent cemetery scenes, heroic cats and a very pretty maiden. The soundtrack even contains Enya's music, an idea that I found pretty ... nice. I'm sure King is disappointed with this little movie, even though he has crappy dialogues and ideas, all from a true and boring King Potboiler. (Although Sleepwalkers, if I understand correctly, is a script without a novel or short story). Nevertheless, these touches of sewage odors show that he did NOT use a ghostwriter ...
