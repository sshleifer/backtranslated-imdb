"Jake Speed" is a beautiful movie with a wonderful message. Of course it has its shortcomings. Sometimes it is a bit slow. It introduces its villain too far into history. The action is performed with the stroke of a snail. It has a Z cast (although I've always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has the straightforward look of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But for all that against, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a charming script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find it so inspiring? Because it says to me "Hey, why do not you try to be a good person." <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a "stranger in a foreign land", that's the good and heroic Jake Speed ​​in the real world, where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a boy scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, evil and evil world. <br /> <br /> That's why "Jake Speed" really had to be a hit. It has a great message that should have gone to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that has really pushed to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying that we should see the Waltons in every theater of the Cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Due South," a TV show about a Canadian Mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to cheer up American entertainment.) Sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood, and guns The general message, though, is If you try hard enough to be a good person, hit the forces of evil each time. 14/10/99
