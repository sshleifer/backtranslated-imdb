I have to say, when "Pushing Daisies" came out, I was instantly defeated by the fairytale attitude of such cruelty. The narrator made a cake out of the ordeal by baking death as routinely as Ned (Lee Pace). And it was just as routine to bring her back to life. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel) as well as the occasional Sidekick Olive Snook (Kristin) Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked such a pleasure, made for fantastic dialogues and stupidity. It definitely deserves the title of a (romantic) comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck are for a shy and not quite ready couple who are still exploring his feelings, although they can not touch it - an obstacle that comes with aids like gloves, cellophane and fancy schedules in the Apartment really does not seem to be an obstacle. Despite the awkwardness with which they tinker their emotions around a strange secret that only a few know, they still succeed in showing their chemistry on screen in moving scenes, as when Ned Chuck gives the beehives. However, the presence of Olive provides some moments when the pie-break-out-in-song moment breaks out and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season dropped sharply and provided real potential for a showdown in a show. In some episodes, the plot line was fast and impractical, so you were asked, "What just happened?" both in the overall view of the dead person of the week and in the parent plot line. The addition of Chuck's father and two half-brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the plotlines felt almost recycled (if the episode "Comfort Food" did not feel like the episode "Bitter Sweets") the dead person of the week died in food?). A few touching moments (the beehives) helped move the relationship between Chuck and Ned forward, but each time they approached, the authors decided to throw another wrench in instead of letting the relationship develop (Oliver comes out of the convent , Chuck 's) The dead father comes alive again and does not go back, you get the picture). Too bad it did not work out, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy smiley and implausible scenarios that remind you that it's not "Dead Like Me" is. Then, according to creator Bryan Fuller, in "Pushing Daisies time", it makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> It should have taken longer, but at this point, it's just wistful thinking. Kudos to all new shows is trying to replace this short-lived gemstone.
