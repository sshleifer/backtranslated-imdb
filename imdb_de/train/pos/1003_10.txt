Another Australian masterpiece that plunges into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it works very well. It does not take on the big special effects that exaggerate like American flicks, but focuses more on the emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that brings Rebecca Gibney & Co. to life. It follows the story of a couple who bought an old house that contained a very old woman who had never gone outside and whose husband disappeared mysteriously a century ago. Strange things happen in the house, and John Adam transforms himself into the lost man, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8.10
