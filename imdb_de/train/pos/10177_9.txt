'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, "Het Gouden Ei", was transformed in 1988 into the great Dutch mystery thriller "Spoorloos" ("The Vanishing"). This is not as good as this thriller (though much better than the American remake, also called) 'The Vanishing'), but sometimes it comes close. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn that he is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt) and comes from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags, it's pretty clear he's smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and played. It creates a kind of tension that you would not normally have in an opening scene like this one. Later we see Egon doing business with a woman in Thailand. Both claim that they have never done such a thing. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward. We see how Egon, still a child (played here by Erik van der Horst), befriends Axel (as a child of Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends and how Axel (as an adult of Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon now goes to college and settles down with a woman. At this time he sometimes meets Axel, but he does not want to have anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film is in some ways chronological. It shows Egon and Axel as children, as students, young adults and mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the film goes back to childhood and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as children, something is explained that happens when they grow up. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers herein. <br /> <br /> The title means "The Cave" and is the cave that gives the movie a happy ending, though in fact he is not so happy. As in the beginning, the end is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and, in a sense, distracts our attention from the first scenes to eventually return to that point. It is the adaptation that gives the film a happy ending, although the dramatic ending is in some ways happy too.
