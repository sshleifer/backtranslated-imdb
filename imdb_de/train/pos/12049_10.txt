I gave this film a tenth with some restraint, as it is hard to praise something that has so haunted and frightened me for years. The woman's sheer threat to Black's face is just horror and the accompanying music makes the fear worse. <br /> <br /> I saw it the first time it was on TV when I was 10 and it really bothered me for years. I am fascinated that so many other users have said so too. There are so many movie reviews about how annoying or scary a movie could be, but you can believe anyone who posted on this forum is really incredibly powerful. I mean, I like horror movies a lot and usually find them pretty funny, but that's really threatening and probably will bother most people. I have not seen it since I was ten, and I'm tempted to see it again, but I'm afraid I might have sleepless nights. I can not say exactly what it is, but I think it has something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's biggest weapon and we as viewers are just as vulnerable as we feel the fear so intensely. It is remarkable that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing compares to that.
