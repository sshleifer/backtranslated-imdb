One of the best films by Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music from Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Great songs include "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All" My Eggs in a Basket. "The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a sweet dance with Rogers Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with Grable among the backup singers Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Roger's Mausy sister "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that stays with you for days and she also sings "But where are you?" The entry in the Astaire Rogers series is snappy and fast and is among the better. The classic and amazing finale "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the most famous of these, with Rogers wearing one of the great gowns in film history ... a shimmering sequin number that twists around her legs when she's (weighted hem This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters have recreated in Pennies from Heaven.Randolph Scott seems to be an unusual choice as Astaire's buddy, but he does shoot Also in her Roberta with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball had bigger parts in 1936, but they have a few scenes and do not work very well. Allwyn has the bigger role, but it's just fine. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series, "Let Yourself Go" ... Jazzy and plump, it's a great song. <Br /> <br /> The whole way is fun, even though after the third time I got full of "We Join the Navy" ...
