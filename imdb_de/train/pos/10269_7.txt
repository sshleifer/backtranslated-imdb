In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this film beats exactly where it hurts ... in the heart! A clean and adventurous female psychiatrist meets the dirtiest and most rogue villains. The vulnerable doctor falls in love with the career badman and asks to be involved in his surgery. While the movie moves rather slowly, its climax and end is breathtaking! You will especially enjoy how the doctor "forgives" himself!
