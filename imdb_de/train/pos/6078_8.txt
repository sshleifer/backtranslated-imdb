I was particularly pleased that Othello himself was dark-skinned in this film and Desdemona did not always have blond hair. The cast also played very well and I really liked the script after Shakespeare's original text. But I have to say that some scenes are too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I've always thought she was very modest, so it's not appropriate to show her in bed with Cassio - though that was only in Othello's imagination. At first I was a little surprised that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was so openly shown. Overall, the movie and especially Desdemona cried in the dying scene.
