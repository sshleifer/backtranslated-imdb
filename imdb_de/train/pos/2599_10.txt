Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so much, I was ready to be disappointed with Joseph Strick and Fred Haines screenplay, given the incredible complexity of the original text. The film, however, proved to be very well done and a fine translation of tone, naturalism and lightness of the book. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine the latter to be incoherent, with very strange episodes that seemingly came together randomly without the text being read to capture the plot. The Irish film censored only in late 2000, when the Irish film was only seen in the public in 2000 (he was in a private movie club, the Irish Film Theater, shown in the Irish film theater in the late 70s). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and slippery, she has many wild "perverted" episodes. It does not matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was filmed in 1967. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and encouraging to see the cream of the world Irish 1960s drama, all respected players, dared to voice Joyce's extremely transgressive lyrics with such zeal and attention , <br /> <br /> Bravo!
