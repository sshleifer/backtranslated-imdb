The last time I saw the movie, I was about seven years old, so my opinions might be blurred over time. At the time, I liked the twist that changed between cartoon and live action. At that time I was sad about the blue camel and its sad life. I was also pleased when Captain Contagious hijacked the heroine (a princess or a toy toe guard) and the tables are pointed at him. Unfortunately, the producers have never decided to put this film on VHS. So my memories are only twenty years old. I'm sure if I saw the movie again, I would think it crazy and juicy, but I really enjoyed the movie back then.
