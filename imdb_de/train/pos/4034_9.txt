Pinjar is a really good movie with great acting, good narration, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films that Bollywood produces nowadays is pretty much improved. This movie is a Proof. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood film I can remember was so impressive to me - I literally spent hours thinking about the movie - and marveling at the different emotional situations in which the human being is One man. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar and also some of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition wall, and all the problems seem sweet when compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie. A technically superior Bollywood product, which in my opinion is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
