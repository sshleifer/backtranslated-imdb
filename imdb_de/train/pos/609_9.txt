Stardust is most enjoyable, very imaginative and a cinematic fairy tale in one. He tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world to find a piece of a fallen star just to find out that the star is alive, young and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is on the brink of death has said that the king is competing with his several sons to see who can first retrieve a ruby ​​as a king, while a witch trio wants the star to get ready and keep her young. These three storylines interweave throughout the picture in a complicated way, combined with good acting, dazzling special effects, and a certain sense of humor. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances by Claire Danes as a star (I could stare at her for a long time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could still stare at her with her magic powers) and played the terrible witch to Robert Deniro, who is an air pirate Perfection plays. Charlie Cox as a leading Tristan is friendly and believable, and we get very good work from a group of boys who play the sons as king and constantly try to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their roles both in life and in death (they loved this thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy, looking for the fun man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more in the short five minutes (beautiful feet) throughout the movie. But the real power of the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fruitful mind. Stardust creates his own mythology and his own world and it works.
