He now has a name, an identity, some memories and a lost friend. All he wanted was to disappear, yet they persecuted him and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants an explanation and let the people ride how they made him what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back and this time he is here with all his might. <br /> <br /> OK, this movie does not have the most elaborate script in the world, but its themes are very smart and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, "The Bourne Suprematy" is like every Hollywood movie since the late 90s, a superhero story. Jason Bourne is a Captain America project that has gone completely astray. In the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in the second. He is now fighting what he considers evil after a person close to him (his girlfriend in "Suprematy") was killed by them. This is all part of the superhero story, including a character with (realistic, yet impressive: almost invincible) superpowers. <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that the evil he is fighting around the world (there are no boundaries in the Bourne movies, the characters move in no time from one continent to another.) as in the best seasons of "24," an American enemy who believes he is fighting for the good of his land makes him completely blind. Funny how "crazy patriots" are now the # 1 paranoid Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> Apart from all these interesting topics, the film is not flawless: the female character of Nickie Parson is useless for the time being and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogue scenes. But that does not matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about the "Waterloo scene" and the "Tangier Persecution" and everyone is right. I especially enjoyed the fight in Tangier, which reminds me in its exaggeration and madness of the works of Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, many intelligent action parts and a good reflection of contemporary American themes: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best movie in the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
