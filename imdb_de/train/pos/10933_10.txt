Be careful with this. Once you get your fingers, the way you look at kung fu movies changes. Of all the kung fu films, you are now longing for a plot, you will be interested in character depth and development, you will long for riddles and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic camerawork and incredible scenery. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects in a single kung fu movie, with the exception of Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> The simplest kung fu movie of all time. Venoms is a mix of rich plot, full of twists and turns, colorful (and evolved) characters, and some of the best camera works of the 70s. The success of a person who likes the movie depends on the ability of the audience to recognize which character is which and who specializes in which poison. One is the centipede, two are the snake, three are the scorpion, four are the lizard, and five are the toad. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. That's the catch, we learn together with the student character and find out who these different men are. We are in his shoes (so to speak) and we have to choose who we trust and who we do not like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> The plot, the characters and the camera work are not only great, it's also fun to look at them, which makes them more valuable in my book than any other movie of its kind. It is worth a whole series of watches to pick up everything that is going on. Venoms is a lesson that Kung Fu really can do. Just do not expect many other kung fu movies to do their thing justice.
