... On stage, on television or in a book, "The Woman in Black" is an outstanding ghost story. Other reviewers have already said almost everything about this movie, but I thought I would also add my belated little review. The film-making film has a deliberately slow first act recording the protagonist Arthur while he's a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I can understand why this does not appeal to all palates. Nevertheless, I love this British-style story, similar to a BBC adaptation "Ghost Story for Christmas" by the great M.R. James's work. In the second act, the ghost story begins when Arthur is sent by his boss to the provinces to clarify the affairs of a deceased customer. The third act relentlessly builds a tantalizing conclusion ... As a Londoner, I saw the play. I own the book DVD-R and have the unabridged audio book on my iPod. What on "The Women in Black" is safe on every medium is a ghost story with few equals. It is about time that there was a legitimate DVD for Region 2.
