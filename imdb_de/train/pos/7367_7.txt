I'm doing film studies on the level of A. S and "this is not a love song" is a movie we've seen, and I think this is a movie with a very simple plot, but a complex backstory. If you scratch the surface, you will find a thriller-chase movie of two men who have run by farmers after a murder by the countryside: - "Sounds pretty exciting". <br /> <br /> However, you have to dig deeper to unveil the true feel of the genre. As I said, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers filled with trust, betrayal and betrayal. We are not told directly by the film of this "love" but by the events that assert themselves, for example, how Heaton acts to Spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "garbage" just because they are created on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complicated story, but definitely an acquired taste, and may not be suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
