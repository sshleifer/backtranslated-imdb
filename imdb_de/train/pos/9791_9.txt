I will not reveal anything when I describe the plot of this film as saying that this begins with the return of a young blind woman to Israel whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It develops like a detective story when the blind woman tries to figure out why her girlfriend has ended her life. If she continues her investigation and the information gathers, this will inevitably lead to a devastating conclusion. The film is expert and acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film is definitely of age and is now competitive with other foreign films, though few in the US have found a large audience.
