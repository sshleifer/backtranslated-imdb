A movie that I expected very little and just spent a quiet hour - but how about an hour. Roll is an excellent, if not overly reputable, little story about "country boy made big in the big city" and it's funny, the characters are adorable and the tempo is just right. Toby Malone is the true star of the movie with its enchanting portrayal of Aussie Aussie Rules compatriot and Aussie football hero coming to the big city to try one of the big teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny. Pay attention to these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
