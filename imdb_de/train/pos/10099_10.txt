The anime that hooked me to anime ... <br /> <br /> Set in 2010 (hey, that's not far off now!), Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Considering the fact that crimes take place every 30 seconds and are committed by thieves with the firepower of Third World terrorists, the fictitious New Port City government trains the tank police to deal with the problem - police with tanks! Oh, the madness! <br /> <br /> Among the "heroes" of this series is the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a red-haired Japanese (yes, I know, they never go with her Japanese name with a Japanese appearance) who did this just drafted to the tank police and is quickly joined with the blond, blue-eyed nice guy Al. Leona is new to the use of tanks. Unfortunately, it destroys the favorite armor of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (aka "Brenten"), a tall guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and a refined pair of sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper Britain did not like that Leona First of all, it belonged to the Panzer Police, and when she destroyed his Tiger Special (a huge green monster tank), she did not make her popular, and he did not like her taking the remains of his huge tank and he used it for one To build miniature tanks, which she calls Bonaparte, and he soon urges her to move to the children's welfare, "where the boys are more your size," as he says. There are also specs, the bifocal genius, biblical quotes / God-fearing chaplains, purple Mohawk with a Moh-hawk, and the big-bellied chief who is right on the edge thanks to the mayor, who always insults him on the antics of the Panzerpolizei. Because the tank police often destroy half the city while chasing down the evil ones and taking them with extreme force, they are not very popular with the people. <br /> <br /> The "bad guys" are a cyborg named Buaku who has a mysterious past associated with a project called "Green Peace," his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma , In the first part, these boys are paid to steal urine specimens from a hospital that treat people who did not get infected with toxic gas clouds, and in the second part they are asked to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story, however, was not completed in the anime and ended in an iconic comic book ("Manga"), which is very hard to find. <br /> <br /> All kinds of chaos and chaos arise in this black comic project. It explores how far people want their police to catch criminals, and what happens when the line between good and evil blurs. If you make a movie out of it, you should get Quentin Tarantino. Unequal places, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
