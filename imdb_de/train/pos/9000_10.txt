I first saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI at its premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. IMPRESSIVE! The blood blew us away with its sheer elan, blood, vitality, blood, excitement, blood, extreme fighting and more blood and so much fun! Especially for those of you who enjoy all these Japanese Chambara Samurai and Ninja movies, you MUST NEVER EXPERIENCE BLOOD!
