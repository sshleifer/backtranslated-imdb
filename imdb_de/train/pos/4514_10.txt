I recently watched this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a friend of mine and we have lots of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of garbage. Try to see it for this purpose! It had not been expected, of course, but the performance of the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script, and the cheap budget had created an amazing mix of stupid things. Tomba had just retired from alpine ski racing, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine world championship titles. Seriously about the director: Nobody knows why Damiano Damiani has signed this film. All other instructions from Damiani are considerable.
