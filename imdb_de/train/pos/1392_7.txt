Bizarre, trippy, forgetful story about everything that concerns the Williams family and the Californian desert. You will witness a series of events escalating in their degree of alienness; Apparently they have fallen into a time-space warp where past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show. dinosaur-like creatures that cheer each other, a friendly and tiny ET who enchants the granddaughter and so on. This picture shows a little imagination, if not more. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, which attracts special effects like David Allen, Randall William Cook, Peter Kuran and, importantly, a sympathetic family is a key element. It creates a feeling of childlike wonderment; It can very well be that it is more of a game for children (or the children in many of us) who are able to overlook all the mistakes in the narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to resist; It's a short and sweet diversion (80 minutes) and a good tribute to director John "Bud" Cardos (from "Kingdom of the Spiders") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
