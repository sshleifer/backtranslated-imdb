Tied up in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel that showed it at the beginning. First, Pachelbel's canons brought a lump in my throat, then the sight of a tiger moth (which my grandfather, my father, and I all flew) made my eyes wet, and then Crowe's name impressed me. I was fascinated by this movie, Crowes Performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt we owe), how different things were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (even my father flew Avro Ansons) story - and how one another post emphasized Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not spoil the movie for anyone, but as a former military officer deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I admit to being separated from my wife a few times. Buy, rent, download, beg, borrow or steal - but watch it. <br /> <br /> PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the floor? Looked like a twin-engine plane with a twin .303 Brownings in a tower.
