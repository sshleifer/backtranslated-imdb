The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I've remembered all these years when I could not sleep for a week or more after I saw it. It just shook me up. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of it, which I can regard as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out which film it was, but I always remembered Barbara Stanwyck being there and finally getting the name and reviews. I enjoyed it a lot, but it scared me! Jaqui
