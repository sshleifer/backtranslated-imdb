Refreshing "lost" gem! We offer effective dialogue combined with excellent action to establish the characters and engage you enough to take care of what happens to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins the fistfighting fight scene, a chase of less than 60 seconds with a 'logical' ending and a long chase on foot that shames the exaggerated chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it will probably end, but the excitement and interest are maintained everywhere. The end of the persecution is one of the most realistic you'll ever see. The movie seems to be slowing down a bit, but it remains a worthwhile conclusion.
