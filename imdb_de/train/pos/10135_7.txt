What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat dull affair is in the end quite funny and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very exciting, but it more than makes up for it with some fancy set pieces and exaggerated gore. <br /> <br /> Spoiler here: <br /> <br /> Top credits too As one of the most despicable characters ever to be seen on screen, go to Martin Donovan's deadly performance. When you play the character in a great "detached" way, you end up feeling pretty bad for the man when his big plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews the landscape by playing a not so good guy who only gets desserts. <br /> <br /> End of spoiler. <br /> <br /> As a revenge dead strip, "Right to Die" benefits greatly from its performers and is more than an OK way to spend less than an hour.
