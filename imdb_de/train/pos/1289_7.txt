Above all, the film is a brilliant work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a small child pretending to be an adult, inheriting a million dollars and how he spends it. I mean, how crazy is this. Walt Disney really excelled this time. The comedy is mostly expected but the others are unexpected. I mean, was this movie okay or was this movie okay. It also teaches a lot about wise teens and I'm really wise for this kid and a bit of contemporary pants. But it's shit, too. How the hell could a guy like this boy get a hot police baby, and his father released him. It's like having a killer kicked out for ten years. If I did, I would be beaten with a 'Suble Jack' (a giant stick that stings when used to really bang your butt). The child is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie, but it's still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The child and the wife had neither chemistry nor the father, but the brothers were excellent. The special effects, however, were lame. Besides, this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved it at the same time.
