Well, I said it all in the abstract, I love the movie and the cast ... I would give every actor an Oscar ... Great, great movie ... I'm 25 now and have seen him 4 times in different periods and times I always think that I will not cry and I always do about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. It was awesome, Jeremy Iron too ... just awesome ... I wish the movie had received more awards ... I really do not know anyone who saw him and did not love him ... well, Glenn Close was awesome. .. the story was both beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that Clara and Esteban loved each other so much in spite of everything and how blanca was close to their parents ...
