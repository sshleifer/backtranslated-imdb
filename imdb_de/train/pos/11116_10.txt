"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas". Nothing of the above can be compared to the complex brilliance of "The Sopranos". Each character has layers on layers of absolute authenticity, completely and completely three-dimensional. We wholeheartedly care for Tony Soprano, even though he is evil in the simplest model of good versus evil. Soprano is the most provocative, complex and intriguing protagonist ever created in this story. If you're in the mood to be clearly challenged as a spectator and your feelings of entertainment are forever changed, check out The Sopranos. I'm telling everyone to sit down and watch Season One's first episode, and I do not want to continue with the show. Every season is brilliant in its own way. DVDs are indispensable for everyone's collection
