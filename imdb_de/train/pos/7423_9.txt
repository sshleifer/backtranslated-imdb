I recently watched the '54' version of this movie with Judy, and although I appreciated the story and the music, I found that the movie did not catch my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story except for a Barbra twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price. This version is so much more real than the '54s, with better music, better acting, a gripping action and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the Top 100 list of the American Film Institute, while this gripping remake has no impact on the list of critics.
