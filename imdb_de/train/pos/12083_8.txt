The second part concerns a young woman in London who is desperately looking for a job and is happy to accept a secretarial post with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy - I feel like a prisoner in the end - but this rather classy B-movie is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. It proved to be unwise to recash this in 1986 as "Dead Of Winter" because the plot elements are not of today. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But remains on track to a precipitous climax that feels a bit sloppy. *** from ****
