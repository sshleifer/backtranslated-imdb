"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." A must if you are on marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Great story, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. However, this is not a film to which the processing errors have to be broken down. This is to sit back and good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie is not really about thinking. It's about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and the action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow-ups, but the first one is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden sides of sniper life. the level of dealing with the whole death. Must see for sniper fans.
