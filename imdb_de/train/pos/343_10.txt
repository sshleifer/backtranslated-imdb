Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards and David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this movie was about, those names were enough to attract me. Beautiful, talented and popular, these are actors I have to pay attention to. <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I start? We already know what the movie is about. Five beautiful girls targeted by a "romantic" serial slasher, a guy they refused 13 years ago at school. His trademarks include subtle threats camouflaged as valentines, maggots infested with chocolates and a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: Well, take a pickaxe, a knife, an electric drill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Okay, basically it's a horror movie with a nice, twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies should not be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all. I love this. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The murderer's mask is childishly scary, and watching Amor shoot his bow and arrow at a victim is really crazy. Acting is awesome: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are lots of fun. I really wanted to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. I'm one of her biggest fans and I would be very happy if she does some leading work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffiel takes on the role of the blond blonde she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a shout ('bleedmedry.com') and this younger version of Denise Richards looked awful like her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Every death scene had a special difference. The scariest was the opening scene in the morgue. The hottub scene was ridiculous, but well done. And the audiovisual labyrinth was scary. The soundtrack is great, with scary music and some fine alternative tunes. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt that the killer did not play enough, we barely saw the mask and not at all during the climax. I also found the highlight really blurry, but still funny. <br /> <br /> The ending was not a big surprise, but I am really glad that the filmmakers decided to save us all "explain killer routine". <br /> <br /> I do not like telling people which movies to watch, but if anyone asks me if I should choose a horror movie that I thought was really worth it to him to see, that would be Valentine it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (bullseye!)
