Flavia (Florinda Bolkan of Do not Torture a Duckling) is imprisoned by her father in a convent of carnal desires. Tired of all the sadism she sees around her (rape of a young woman in a pigsty, sexual craving) (neutering horses) Flavia decides to flee the monastery with her Jewish friend Abraham. The two do not get very far before being captured and then returned to be tortured and repented. After the punishment, she joins forces with a group of Muslims called Tarantulas, who had previously invaded the monastery and led a crusade that turned into a bloody battle behind the monastery walls. "Flavia the Heretic" is a well-known and rather notorious piece of Italian nonsploitation. The movie is a bit cruel and sloppy. The acting is great and the characters are well developed. Overall, "Flavia the Heretic" is a really moving and intelligent movie with lots of nudity and gore. You can not go wrong with him.8 out of 10.
