This must be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While "Rebel Without A Cause" and "Say Anything" provide beautiful portrayals, this movie eliminates unnecessary subplots and Hollywood divergences. This film focuses exclusively on watching the emergence of a beautiful romance. They never doubt for a moment that the film will lead to the romantic mating of these two persons. You almost instantly feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure joy to watch them. This film is mostly dialog oriented. But every conversation between them is very interesting. What makes this couple so romantic is how real it is. However, in all these conversations, which often have no real impact on anything critical, you can feel the nuances as these two become more loving and trusting. This is exactly how you would dream that you are meeting this special person. And what makes it so true is that it's not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you were confident that you were having a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere by accident. And what's the icing on the cake in this film is the great scenery of Vienna, where this film takes place. It just adds something to the romantic nirvana feeling that the movie suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'll ever get tired of it.
