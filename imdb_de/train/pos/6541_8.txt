As an adult in my mid-40s, I'm not even close to one of Nancy Drew's main demographic dates, but I was pleasantly surprised by the movie this afternoon; So I found that the pair of sixty silver-haired ladies in the row lay next to me. The older man, who left the theater shortly before me, explicitly praised the film for the 20-year-old female usher (who said she had seen the movie last night and liked it a lot). <br /> <br /> Read more The point, however: in the row right in front of me were nine - counted girls, nine - ten year old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and sweets and giggling at the previews. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, they immediately settled down to .... <br /> <br /> .... and did not peek until the end credits. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; It does not quite pay off the high school undergrounds, it's not quite confident enough, and its thugs are just a hair too critically incapable. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot is fairly well connected and moves skillfully between the sins of excessive cheesiness and over-modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts wears the film with amazing grace - despite the excellent timing of Josh Flitter, this is Roberts' movie, and she does it wonderfully. Her Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Veronica Mars, Kristen Bells, and the film is also a direct descendant of Jodie Foster's early and underrated "Candleshoe." <br /> <br /> In today's market, this is a rarity: a family movie that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it's not for everyone's taste - but what it is, it's the best movie of its kind in decades.
