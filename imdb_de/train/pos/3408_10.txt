I give this film an A + for the sheer camp! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in her mother's book, "If you see the garden of Allah in the context of a high camp, it can be very amusing." And how! I laughed with pleasure at the revised score and the amazing, ridiculous, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who read Boyer's Toupet's reports (it kept getting into the heat) will giggle on every gig. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer seldom look at each other when they speak. Instead, they look dreamily into the distance, presumably so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most favorable light (if you star in a turkey, that might look good too!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in her book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount Travis Banton and let him design some of the most divine dresses, such as the beige chiffon dress and the cape. <br /> rave about the Technicolor. It's really hard to believe that the movie was shot in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at the garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace his stupidity, you can not help but enjoy it.
