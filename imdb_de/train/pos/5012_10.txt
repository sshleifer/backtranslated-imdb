In April 1965, CBS broadcasted the first monumental television programs by Barbra Streisand. The show was not only an absolute success in the race, but also received 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of television of the 1960s and (unfortunately) the kind of television special that they no longer produce. With special songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this special is a must for any fan of Streisand and anyone interested in early television.
