This is another great movie that I was fortunate to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker and others). In the late '80s I was a relative newcomer to the genre and just really new to the big three JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard earned money to see this in a "Triple Bill of Classics" of the old Scala. I should not have worried, I was breathless from this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie yet, do the NOW!
