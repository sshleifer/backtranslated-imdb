This shorter movie is the epitome of expected results when the fool performs the asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people was rolled down at a craps table when neither Saddam Hussein nor the people of Iraq, God, the souls of the over 350,000 people who were killed, were resting, had anything to do with terrorism, or al-Quida. <br /> <br /> Following this movie, the attentive viewer must pick up or download a copy of "Loose Change". This movie is available for free on the Internet until the Bush cabal blocks it by passing the title as described above, as indicated in brackets. <br /> <br /> God saves our land. This will not happen if the Christofascists who controlled the congress halls more than ten years before November 2006 are persecuted!
