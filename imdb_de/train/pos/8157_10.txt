R rated for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The fear of a black hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. Basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal Tap. It's a shame that not many people have heard of this gem of a movie. If you find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it, even if you do not like rap music. There are not too many comedy films I give a perfect 10/10 too. The only ones I can think of right now are this movie, Employees, The World after Garp, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Chasing Amy. This movie is a funny stereotype of gangsta rap culture.The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who is making a documentary about the fictitious rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a rap group that makes many controversial rap songs for killing and doing gangsta. Fear of a black hat is an excellent comedy movie, and I recommend it if you're not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It's a shame that this movie is not in the top 250. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88min. <br /> <br /> 10/10
