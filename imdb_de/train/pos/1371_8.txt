This film is a delightful, carefree look on both sides, where the "Club Kid" rave scene mingles with the New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo of ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is "Torch Song Trilogy" for the lively teenage girls. "That Girl" for our dissatisfied Millennium Times. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is quick and witty, and Parker Posey's client deserves - if not an academy - a "wave of kudo" in the stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film rests on the very stylish plateau heels of Miss Posey and it is perfectly staffed. Like many of her acting skills, she may not be very deep, she is often self-referential and well-posed ... but it all works. She's a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this movie entertains her, she wears it on her shoulders like a leopard faux-sleeve, never letting her fall to the ground. Mary is a superficial party fashionista. It's not up to stealing designer clothes from a friend's closet or chopping them up with someone else's friend. At a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are carefree in every way, including other people; and the process of learning that caring for life is necessary. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully designed, witty and the only performance that gets disappointed is the aunt in a way too one-dimensional and too hard a hand. a differentiated performance of her would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... that's a comedy. A surprisingly deep role that gives this film substance and world view, is the Fallafel sales friend. We should all be so happy ... is he the one for Mary? or the one who gets away? <br /> <br /> I rate this as 8 because it's not a great moment in movie history, not a classic and not a great art (all of which get deeper and richer in re-viewing)). Like "Desperately Seeking Susan," it represents something very true to its time, but it may become irrelevant over time. Still, it has everything a fun movie needs and is worth a visit just for the clothes!
