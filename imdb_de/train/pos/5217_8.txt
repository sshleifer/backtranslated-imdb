I recorded this movie on cable late at night and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why the film was not better known because the topic is very disturbing. But if you can deal with the subject of sexual abuse, this is a well-presented, exciting and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the theme is not for the faint-hearted, the movie is not brutal (like 8mm for example). <br /> <br /> I can highly recommend him to any serial killers and suspense movies.
