I love this program! It's like watching a mini-movie every week !!! The first episode was so gripping and scary ... so Part 2 of the pilot was ... I'll definitely get into this show again! This is the true survivor! I've looked at some other comments and see that after just one or two episodes, the idiots are already crying ... I'm sorry, if it's not a reality show, Kiddies! There was a time when there was ... now get ready! Current TV shows! And this is really good, unlike most of today's crappy sitcoms or the innumerable copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series they're sticking out. I take one of the bones here!
