Boris and Bela get along well in this film, whether they compete against each other or paddle with the same boat. I saw this boat in 1972 and bought it at Borders this year. This time, as I watched with my children, I noticed two things: it caught the attention of a 3, 4, and 5 year old; and I heard some things that I had not seen when I saw it for the first time. Very fast story with an unpredictable ending. A must for movie fans !!!
