My interest was aroused as I leafed through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought OK, let's see what that is. I'm so glad I stayed on the canal. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some exaggerated acting, but a wonderful time one could have. I look at it and it makes me sad for all the hustle and bustle the movie industry plays out, and these beautiful little gems are passed over. Try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slowly, but the drama builds up and you are drawn into the story. When I saw this beautiful movie, I wanted to wrap myself in more Greek tragedy and pathos.
