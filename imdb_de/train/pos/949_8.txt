"Telefilms" tend to fall under the traps of a low budget and a hasty turnaround, which is why this movie always tends to resist the trend. George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly and comprehensively all his cold tendencies and still makes him a compassionate character. The production value for this film was exceptional, he has never relied on boffo special effects or soundstage setups, but relies on the depth and clarity of on-site filming and on strong backdrops. A movie that surely stands alone.
