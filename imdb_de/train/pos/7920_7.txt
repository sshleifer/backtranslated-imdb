Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly Tony (Arkin) is your average high school type. Preparing for the big homecoming game, anger with girlfriends and growing hair in strange places - you know the usual. But the hair in strange places will get a bit out of control when a trip with his father (JA! McMahon) leaves for Transylvania with a nasty case of the suburbs. Now doomed to go to the world forever as a werewolf, how will Adam get girls? <br /> <br /> Full Moon High is not often talked about, but it's a stupid and entertaining horror mistake. Larry Cohen (Q, The Winged Snake, The Stuff) contains as many gags as he may suspect as an author / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good timing in the lead role. If you are a fan of parodies like "Airplane" and "Student Bodies", you will have fun with this cuddly celebration.
