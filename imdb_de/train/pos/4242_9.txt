I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is a diamond among the coals of this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and convey the intensity of their characters without errors. This movie should have made them stars. Pity in the studio, because I did not put everything behind this film. It could easily have been a franchise. The release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this movie. Look in your TV guide and if you see it in the list, no matter what time, look at it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since then, or at least we believe they did.
