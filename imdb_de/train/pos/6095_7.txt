I got a bit in conflict about that. The show is awful on the one hand, the acting is awful (even if we have names like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in an episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise / moral of each episode feels like something taken out of a 50s educational short. By no means are you afraid of any of these episodes, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, purposeless and cheesy in a sort of Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos. Way. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things ever to see on TV. The 80s fashion, the soft focus makes the actors look as if on the set of The View at all times, the premises lend the material more self-parody than fear, so we have an episode left in which a schoolchild is scared when his SAT does not fail, his girlfriend will let him down and his parents will judge him, another fears that she will be jailed for being an inferior mother (her husband is played by Brad Pit), another is afraid that all parents Fearful in the world he is in a league against him as he runs away from home, another fears that she will be confused with her socially backward twin, another fears if he does not give up his mother and stepfather for a party killed in his house. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Because these are dreams, you might look beyond the ridiculous plot points and devices, but they are so out of the left field that the writers have no opportunity to actually scare the audience. They've dressed characters from a '80s nightmare who walks around, making bad dialogues in a very hammy way and making illogical decisions that serve no purpose other than to move the story to the next weird plot point (usually the peripheral characters observe this ) something uncharacteristic of common sense, while our main character looks stunned and too shocked to do anything about it.) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something to scare you, stay away. On the other hand, if you're looking for one of the funniest things that ever came out of the '80s. Look at it. <br /> <br /> His programs have recently been shown (almost every day) on Chiller TV, and I've seen it out of curious curiosity, and now just so I can laugh well every day. With Arrested Development and extras from the air, this is officially the funniest on TV.
