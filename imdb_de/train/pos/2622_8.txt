Everyone, my name may sound weird, but nothing else! Anyway, I've never seen anything like that, so it was crazy! That's a good thing, of course. It's a hilarious movie and my absolute favorite activity is how they bring other things together. Like a chicken, the fish pretending to be King Kong, and Runt the pig saying, "Twas Beauty that killed the beast," was War of the World's scene and more. Walt Disney Company has NOT lost contact, maybe not for this one. How they made it as if they were watching a movie, and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> But some parts do not fit. Like the original Lion King, Timon and Pumbaa were not dating Simba when he beat Scar? They are not in this movie! they fought the hyenas behind the scenes. The reason is that Pumbaa is not so confident because he was pushed away from the other animals and only Timon, Timon and Timon. Everyone knows that only Timonn's story was told, while Pumbaa only had flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's "VERY BIG"!
