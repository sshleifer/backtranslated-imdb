Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller from 1990, released here in the UK under the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It's a desert horror movie about a group of young friends who are celebrating the weekend just to be killed one by one by an unknown force driving a menacing black truck !!! This movie has some scary scenes, and here and there a bit of blood, but I have to say that acting was so lame, even if you keep the budget low! But the movie was strangely addictive and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or turned off, which is always a good sign! I would have given this movie almost 6/10, but as he built himself on the way to more steam, he had some good moments of suspense and suspense, had a good nudity and the fact that the blonde starring in the women too hottie was! I will give it 7/10.
