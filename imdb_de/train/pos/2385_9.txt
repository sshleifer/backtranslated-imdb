In the old blank audio cassette advertisement, the line reads "Is it real or is it memorex?" The same goes for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage," the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock has sent the ship to bring it to the forbidden planet Talos IV so that Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who is burned and paralyzed, can return there. Why the fumbling? Because if you have any contact with Talos IV, a death penalty will be imposed. Why this is so is never explained - that has disturbed me enormously - but if not otherwise, it contributes to the story. After convincing the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns to Dr. McCoy (the chief officer in attendance, Captain Kirk was away from the ship) says, "The charge is mutiny, Dr. I never got the order to take over the ship." What follows is a court-martial in which we Thanks to the Talosians, why (besides the obvious paralysis) for Capt. Pike was so important to get to Talos IV, even if Mr. Spock's death threatens. The illusions of the Talosians, the background music and the whole storyline are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as Keeper (the main Talosian) is wonderful. Call me sexist, but I never thought to have a woman in that role, but she was perfect! The Talosians, who have abandoned almost all physical activity and rely almost entirely on the power of illusion, are also unisex. You can not really tell if they are male or female and it does not matter. This episode, like no other in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a nice thing, if that were the case! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen her (I even have her on video), she keeps captivating me. Meg Wyllie LOOKS like an alien and I do not mean that unfriendly.
