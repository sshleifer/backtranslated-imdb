I had a blast watching this movie ... despite the feeling that I had plenty of time that this movie has almost copied Monsters Inc. a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. It felt like I like that throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming features is Scrat :) Very, very funny character, even if it has no purpose :)
