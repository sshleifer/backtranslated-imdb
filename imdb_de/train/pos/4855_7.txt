The question of whether or not you like this movie version of "The Ghost Train" always depends on one thing: a reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> He tends to steal almost all the scene he's in and not always on a good path. Sometimes one wishes oneself to calm down or retire a little so that the many characters of the plot can unfold and develop (which they do to some degree). But somehow everything points again and again to Askeys Tommy Gander figure. <br /> <br /> I personally like the movie and Askey even to some extent. I always seem to be stuck in the odd hours of the early morning when I can not sleep and really do not find the energy to see anything else. There is something about looking at old black and white movies in the quiet darkness of the dawn that I find appealing ....
