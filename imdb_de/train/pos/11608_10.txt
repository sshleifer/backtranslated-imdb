This is a great movie. When I read other reviews, I see that I'm not the only one who sheds a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, she made the end of hearts and unforgettable. In the hands of a smaller actress her last scene would have seemed banal and banal. You never thought that this movie was made on a tight, limited budget. The cinematography is great and there are a number of famous actors. The script is so wonderful, I can see why they all wanted to be there. If you look at the long, long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii is in the process of making this film, and with good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the movie. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
