Let me make one thing clear: For the most part, the mentality of those who direct the show in Hollywood makes me frankly quite general, and especially in terms of treating many popular, iconic characters from comic books. Why? Well, let's take a typical Hollywood board meeting session scenario to illustrate, shall we? .. <br /> <br /> Executive No. <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 'Good point, then we'll do it in a hurry! ?? We make a happy bath in a cap and find a random superhero on which we can build a movie! '(The bath takes place and a famous superhero name is pulled out). <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Great! Well, who can we play the role? '<br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 "Who is a big box-office star right now?" <br /> <br /> Executive Nr.1 ​​'* Name of the great actor * is the right one this week.' <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 'But does he really fit the role? I mean, he does not resemble the character at all. '<br /> <br /> Executive # 1' Who cares ?! He is a big name. We'll do the movie with him anyway. '<br /> <br /> Executive No. 2' You're absolutely right! And besides, we fill the entire movie so full of glittering special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will question him anyway! "The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons that I generally clarify abhor the most modern superhero films. Any style, no substance and simply pathetic casting of iconic leads. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when does Hollywood get it right? Take the casting of the original (and still the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and, most recently, Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men films. <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative traits Hollywood is showing nowadays? .. would not it be wonderful if our studio were executives should ALWAYS choose actors who actually fit the roles? Well, in this non-ideal world, a filmmaker believes this or not by exchanging actors based on their real resemblance to their fellow comics. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to make a feature film, but luckily he has given us tantalizing insights into what the final result would look like in the form of two (previously) famous people. One is the great Batman: Dead End and the other is this fake trailer for a totally fictional movie titled Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, do not let us hack our words here? That's absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> The casting of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn (who looked similarly fantastic, but was completely wasted in the dull barbarian) is the perfect choice to play the iconic steel man. In terms of physical similarity, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approach to the cartoon character. On this move, Clark Bartram is returned from his magnificent portrayal as Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Another very reasonable casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If only this was a real full-length movie! Hollywood Studio Executives? note! That's how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final comment, I am again fascinated by the extremely split reactions that this short film has triggered by fans. Significantly, the sharpest and most vehement side effects on the other hand (as with Batman: Dead End) clearly come from a younger, less cinematic audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatical primitive chants and the liberal use of the basic dictum. Such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon, even though our aforementioned studio managers in Hollywood will undoubtedly draw great satisfaction from it. After all, these misguided individuals are in all likelihood the exact same kind of CGI-dependent popcorn fuddles that revel in the majority of the crap that Hollywood is now hatching by the deluge.
