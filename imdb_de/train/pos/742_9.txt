Coming of age films are commonplace today. For 1980, "Foxes" really gives its meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character directly. Since she did "Taxi Driver" four years ago, she has a stronger character in this film. She's Jeanie, a high school girl who has the guts to emerge from any situation she's in. Scott Baio plays Brad on "Happy Days" long before Chachi. The other girls consider him immature. Cherie Currie is Annie, hangs out with the wrong audience and is persecuted by her policeman. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house, where a party is completely out of control. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is always saved by Jeanie and Brad when wasted. The reality comes back hard where she is killed in a car accident. And you marry a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In fact, you have to take care of the people around you. For me I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great action, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
