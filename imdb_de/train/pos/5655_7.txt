I was watching this show because it was said to be reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I really like. The show quickly introduces us to the main characters, and quite uncommonly, the pilot episode for me is the best, extremely dramatic, and really brings out the whole evil side of the show, ready to move the rest of the season forward. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little disappointed with the show - probably not on my own fault, as it was canceled after only one season. She seemed to show a lot of potential and deserves a much better treatment than she had. The show is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) I've ever seen that are well developed in a short time. For the first 5 or 10 shows, there is the strange cheese effect, which is a bit overly dramatic. However, this will be corrected during the season. Worth a watch, definitely something out of the ordinary!
