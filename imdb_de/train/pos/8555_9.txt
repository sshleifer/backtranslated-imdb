* First, although many say it's the worst in the series, I do not think it's true. Considering that this ideally reflects the youth mentality of the 21st century, it offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenage times, if you had the same fun as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that this is a teenage movie, but comedy movies should not be for teenagers anymore these days? ... Cinemas are usually the place where teenagers can meet. In addition, it is very good to see such a movie during a sleepover or similar. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's get real ... does not that reflect the thoughts of teen boys like those in the movie? what would you like to see ... clever books, romantic stuff? that's not what these teenagers would think of ... <br /> <br /> * In the end, I think if you're a teenager, you really need to watch the movie, and even if you have a movie A truly adult man or woman, you should see it if you still have a teenage mind or often think about what it's like to be a teenager, or things like that. Thank you for reading!
