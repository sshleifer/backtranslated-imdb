No, I'm telling a lie, this is not the best movie ever, but it's a really entertaining movie that nobody I know has seen. <br /> <br /> It's a buddy movie with Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with a fluffy story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that does not matter. The reason this movie is fun is the interaction between the two main characters, who initially dislike each other and mistrust each other, but end up making friends in a shocking turn of fate. The whole cultural difference is pretty good, as it's fun to watch, it's absolutely ridiculous, but in a cheesy and pleasant way. The soundtrack is cool, again in a cheesy 80s style, it fits the movie. I have been trying to find one of the songs for a long time, but since I work from memories of what I think, some of them are words I could not find. <br /> <br /> Another thing this movie has is the most awesome payout I've ever seen, but I will not betray it, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this movie over 48 hours. Most Eddie Murphy's editions, including the cop in Beverly Hills, and whatever the buddy Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have got their name. If you're looking for a good cop movie and you're fed up with "Straight White Cop and Crazy Streetwise Black Cop", give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised because this turns the entire formula upside down with straight Japanese policeman hitting crazy white cops. <br /> <br /> I give these 7. To be honest, I like it more than that. I would rather watch that than many things I would give. But I know it's some kind of madness that I like about this movie.
