I was annoyed all the time by my family and friends because of my tears for movies, and they were not disappointed when I saw this. I cried many times, but believe me, it was not cocky. I longed for the family and I demanded this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew. Denzel was as fabulous as always and Chris Walkin too. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize it; The years were not friendly to him. My husband can not watch movies again, unless it's about historically accurate war movies (snoring !!!!). He's been watching this movie five times now, and I'll have to get the DVD to watch again because he's been out of the band and it's jumping all the time I've seen.
