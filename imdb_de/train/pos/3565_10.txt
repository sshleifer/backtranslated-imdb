Guys and Dolls is a unique game based on the characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class player who makes a bet for one thousand dollars with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra). Nathan needs the money so he can run his usual crap game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky could not bring any girl to Havana, Cuba, and the "doll" he chose was Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), who was in charge of a missionary. Finally, Sky impresses Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. In the end, they fall in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he was not involved in. The night they left, Nathan made a crap game in the missionary. Nathan's 14-year-old fianc√© Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapproves of Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him. But when the movie ends, everything ends happily with a double wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just wonderful, no matter who sings them. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no singing voice and it would be true they could have dubbed it, but that did not matter. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously seen as Brando) and played his character very well. I've seen some movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest, she could not sing either. However, the vocals consist of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like musical and even if you do not, I advise you to see this.
