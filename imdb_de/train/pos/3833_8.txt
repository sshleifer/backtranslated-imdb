I can not believe that others took everything so seriously. God, it was a lot of fun to root Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the western series of years. It should not be a great cinematic experience unless it was. What if there were no big special effects bonanza? It was a fun, winking look at the old western. Man, relax and enjoy.
