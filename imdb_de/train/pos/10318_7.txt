It said both The Movies and baseball were successful during the Great Depression. It seems that the cruel realities of a nation seized by this economic catastrophe have created a need for occasional relief for the people. A temporary escape can be found in the ongoing soap opera, baseball. <br /> <br /> Also an occasional 2 to 3 hour excursion to the darkened auditoriums of the cinema. The presence of a radio in virtually every house kept Depression Era America instantly attuned to world events, providing drama and (especially) comedy shows a pleasant interlude of harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of the time also flourished at all levels. The adolescent reading habits have helped make the comic book as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic book just did not seem magical, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. There were media that were ancestors to her. Obviously, the newspaper comic was one of the parents that represented the visual / narrative method of storytelling. The other direct ancestor was Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive, prosaic tales in which many stories were carried along with the same adventure figures, although they were not necessarily serialized. The pulp medium had been on the market for several decades, introducing us to Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO. The 1930s saw a great harvest as characters such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8's BATTLE ACES, and THE SPIDER, MASTER of MEN, all came to the newsstands, among others. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a thoroughbred superhero of written history; The pulp envelopes may have been the hero's only "picture." Doc was the prototype of the superhero. He also put together 5 of his former Army Buddies to form a small, freelance team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a particular field. So we had a top rating: chemist, lawyer, civil engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc. The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were released in the mid-50s. Then they went well 12-15 years into a break. Then came the brainstorming to pack the old novels in a new "container", the paperback. A new look for the cover was presented with a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a shirt that was constantly torn off. <br /> <br /> The reintroduction proved very successful with the release of a title a month (and for a while more). Soon there was a rumor about a movie by Doc Savage! But when from which producer? Well, the venerable "Man of Bronze" was back in the newsstands for more than 10 years before a real project was put together. It was the veteran stop-action animator and producer of the best special effects movies, Geoprge Pal, who shot the film with Warner Brothers. When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE, arrived at the Movie Houses, it boasted a well-stocked cast, but largely "No Name," as far as he is familiar with the viewers. With the former Tarzan of TV, Ron Ely's almost perfect casting in the lead role, rising Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead role and veteran Paul Wexler (as the villain, Captain Seas); No other name would have been recognized. And, maybe that was a plus in that case. <br /> <br /> History does a good job of familiarizing most viewers with the incredible group while initiating action. The use of the narrative by Paul Frees and short movie clips are the method to bring the introduction to the main part of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there is evidence that this story is progressing with the same kind of "camp" humor as the Batman TV series. Some really great-looking early scenes, in which Doc and the entire crew align their individual specialties, are thrown off the Paul Frees narrative and the unexpected, unlikely results in the direction of humor. (For example, it turns out that an experiment by Docs with a miniature rocket / rocket is part of a fishing method, a small one of them.) The whole story runs like this and hits the viewer with a small 'camp' so often to us again and again to remember not to take it too seriously. We are also confused that George Pal's is the producer (his last). The one who was so well-known for special effects is certainly a factor that could be well-used in a pulp-character science-fiction action environment. I can remember that I saw her quite vividly. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, just our second child, Michelle (14.08.75), was born. Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, and after the visiting hours at the maternity ward were over, we headed straight for the old Marquette Theater, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> Since I am a guy who is very familiar with Doc, the end product somehow made me disappointed. I could accept a little bit of this 'camp' business, but I would not have minded if Mr.Pallo would have liked to take it all in and have some decent dinosaurs and volcanoes, all a bit more pulp / Comic / to give. Series-typical excitement. <br /> <br /> Still, the cast, led by Ely and the others, made the whole movie likeable, if not gracious. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very similar to those of a serial or adventure strip of the '30s that would be fun for everyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's exactly what they tried with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE.
