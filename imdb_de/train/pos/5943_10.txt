This movie is really cool. Everything looks like from the comic book. The sets, the costumes and the plot are great. Clark Bartram is our favorite Batman again. he looked a little better in the dead end, but he still manages. Superman is great, too. the flying effects are in order. But it's a fan movie, so we can not expect it to be the biggest. The shot with Superman getting the car was VERY believable. It was cool. This is a movie that I would definitely see if it were real. It has everything you would expect in a Batman / Superman movie. An exception, I would occupy the Joker instead of 2-face.
