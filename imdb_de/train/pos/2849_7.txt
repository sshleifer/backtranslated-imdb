I can not say that this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before it was viewed and did not fare as well as I had imagined. The bar was not that high, so the fact that my expectations were met does not say much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The city of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city should be more than just an attitude, but one of the main characters. There are really tender moments, humorous conversations and turns left and right that make everything interesting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let more fashion". Certainly the good skits / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are many sketches that fall into the category "in between", in fact too many, which ultimately brings the movie to a standstill. Also, the diversity of New York, though hinted at and hinted at throughout the movie's many distant pans, is never really recognized or analyzed to do justice to the city. For example, many of the skits are well suited for middle-aged white wines. I mean, I know that the city is home to many of those populations, but come on. The diversity of Paris Je'taime and the variety of characters make New York City look like Lancaster, PA or anywhere really white. It is simply disappointing to see that the city is short on heritage. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would recommend to give New York, I Love You, a view. Who knows, maybe you disagree with my opinion and maybe not. You will never know it until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from watching this film, as opinions differ on art. I just give you a very vague idea of ​​what to expect.
