I think "Blackadder the Third" is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the episodes are funny, personally I like the episode with the "French Invasion", but the one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also very funny, the way Rowan continues playing with them is really (English) humor at the highest level. Actors: 'Never say that again, always call it the Scottish actor; Blackadder: Oh, shall I say the Scottish piece? Actor: JA Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I do most of his work, but I think he did the Blackadder series very well. <BR> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he's already working on a Bean 2 movie that's going to hit the market this year, me can not Hardly Wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this 3rd blackadder a 9 out of 10 points.
