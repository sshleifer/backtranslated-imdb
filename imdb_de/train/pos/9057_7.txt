Let's just keep it simple: my two children were glued to this film. It has its weaknesses from the perspective of an adult, but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty hot, although she's not very much in the movie, so do not be so excited. <br /> <br /> This is not really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you only look at once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the fathers.)
