This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want her, but reluctantly accepts her. It seems that she is currently studying to be a witch by completing a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I know this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come on !!) before she can finish the course, even though the college is closed because of the war (???), and she's looking for Head Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magic bed button. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time when I was 9 and I vaguely remember loving it. It certainly does not last as an adult! The story is stupid (even for a fantasy), the kids are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly disgusting. Also Roddy McDowall is third and appears only in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboombu, which is operated by animated animals. I thought that might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and there is a very violent and much too long football game between the animals. There are a few saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; the songs (while forgotten) are pleasant; The long dance scene on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still impressive at the end. But the weak plot, the bad animation and the unlikely kids really pull things down. I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give a 7
