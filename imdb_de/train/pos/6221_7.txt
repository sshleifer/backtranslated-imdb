If this movie had been put together a bit better, it would be with the best of Astaire and Rogers up there. It's a good movie, but too long with a boring subplot, ie Randolph Scott, who plays Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (this is Ozzie Nelson's wife to you, baby boomer) Scott are two Navy men. Scott meets Hilliard the first time she looks like a stereotypical librarian and later, after Ginger Rogers has asked her friend (a blond but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to enchant her. In the meantime, Astaire tries to find out where he and his old dance partner left off. The result is some wonderful dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team and separately: "I'll put all my balls in a basket", "Let's go" and "I'd rather lead the band." Hilliard is cute, but a bit lethargic, when a simple Jane became a glamor girl, though she sings her two songs well: "But where are you?" and "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - a poster was not interested in the song, but I love the title. Rogers is lively, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film comes at the end with "Let's Face the Music and Dance", one of the most painfully beautiful songs ever written, one of the most brilliant executions of Rogers and Astaire. In it they embody the glamor and imagination of the 30s. It's really appreciated and kept on watching.
