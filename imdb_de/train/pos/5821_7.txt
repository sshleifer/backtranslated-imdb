I was quite surprised to read honestly some of the comments on this work. Some people were looking for a plot ??? OK, when this video came out over a decade ago, I saw it the way it was: a collection of music videos. It is not a movie. It has neither an action nor a central action. It's a pretty artistic anthology of mostly long format videos, all of which are done quite skillfully or creatively. Michael Jackson may be a freak these days, but after all, this was the guy who gave us thrillers (considered by many to be the best music video ever) and starring Billie Jean and Beat It Trends. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who worked with him made music and dance again to create entertaining things, including claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (the Badder sequence). And for those who wondered what Joe Pesci did there, this video appeared just a little before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable movie appearances. I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats everything Michael Jackson has done to this point!
