The movie was gripping from start to finish and the b / w photography of the American heart is breathtaking. We feel like we're with them as they cross Heavenland and then back to Mexico and back to America. Towards the end of the movie, the rain on Robert Blake looks like little streams of sweat and tears rolling down his face. At the end we follow them up the stairs until their last moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals listed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on every street in every city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the man with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of the city. This point is touched on in the movie, and it keeps surprising us that criminals look no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most abominable, is part of the human situation. These two insane men kill a whole family and look for a safe that is not there. Once they are on the run, they start writing bad checks and finding a way for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many good supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as Detective Alvin Dewey. Also Will Geer shines in a short but excellent scene as a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I often wanted to see this movie through and through, as I only caught it in short clips; After buying the DVD, I finally got around to it. The result is the best classic thriller I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this brilliant movie. For me, that's what great filmmaking is all about.
