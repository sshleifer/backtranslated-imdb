What do you do with a 14-inch tense pornstar who was involved in drugs and murder and then died of AIDS? Of course you make a movie. The probable reason why it was not done earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash was in the way of his production. It's no coincidence that the movie was filmed shortly after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why should it be like this? There is too much good material to require dull filler scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a number of films, so here was finally a role that suited him well. Bosworth is cute, so it does not matter how she behaves (she's solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise rather annoying, is pretty good, largely because he has so many facial hair that I did not recognize him first , (I wish they had done this in every movie with Cruise so I would not have to see his stupid face.) I could not recognize Christina Applegate at all and did not know she was there if I had not seen her name in the credits , Kudrow is charming as always, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (By the way, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting decisions that were questionable were an early cameo by Carrie Fischer and the utterly absurd inclusion of Morea Janeane Garofalo from the '90s. They thought I included Paris Hilton, right? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a stupid whore. Because the movie is about decadence, among other things? and about a porn actor? it fits perfectly.
