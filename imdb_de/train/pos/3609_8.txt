Went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I made a bad or a good buy. It is the later result when I see the entire film from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, has done a great job and her look is beautiful, sexy and at the same time a true study of the art of how acting is really done. Diana did not like her domestic life and especially her own father because of the abuse he gave her mother. She chooses boxing at a local Brooklyn gym and is not really accepted by male boxers. In her high school, there is a lot of friction between her classmates and boys. There is a lot of action in the ladies' pool and references regarding private parts of guys. If you like boxing and seeing a hot girl doing wonders in the ring and the boys are awakening to you, you know what that is, this is the movie for you.
