Kudos to Fawcett for taking on roles that were considered controversial at the time. As far as I remember, rape in the 1980s was still a taboo subject, and women's rights and emotions were rarely studied so thoroughly at this time. Russo He is appropriate as an obsessed psychopath, but sometimes somewhat transparent. Diana Scarwid has a role, as does Alfre Woodard as roommate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences if Fawcett, the victim of the rape, avenges the perpetrator. The scene in which she throws Russo a frying pan of hot oil is classic, and as a rapist he deserves it. She then holds him in bondage, and the consequences must be addressed. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been physically and mentally injured. Highly recommended. 8.10.
