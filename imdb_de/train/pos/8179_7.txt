It would have been so much fun to see a theater in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste that really appreciates well-made shocker movies. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is likely to be postponed sometimes because people usually have strong feelings about dental matters. Perhaps the ADA has launched a campaign against this as dentists report that they have to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to many in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing to know that the film was shot on the Trivia side in 21 days. Of course, post-production sometimes takes longer than filming, and editing "The Dentist" is perfect. The fast cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "cares" for his wife, only two short cuts show what happens. The rest is up to our very fruitful ideas! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role, as he has a lot of experience with psychologically "off" characters and has completely sold the compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the tempo of the movie was just right. The filmmakers do the mischief of the woman just right. All the characters in the dental office look like they are real people working in a real office. There is a lot of excitement as they deal with impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is facing a huge psychotic collapse! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very close. All victims fall into the trap of the dentist in a calculated way. Two types of law enforcement agencies even take part in a small subplot that eventually creates a shock for a showdown. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for the faint-hearted or the phobic, but for a real roller-coaster ride and for fans of intelligent gorefests.
