Cage as his luck worsens after ending from a bad ending Empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a former city behind the hotel. It has been stated from the beginning that Mr. Cage is incapable, but he is not out and he may be broke, but he will not steal, not even in his present unfortunate circumstances. In the consequence, if he of Mr. J.T. For his husband, whom he has assigned to murder his wife, Mr. Cage asks the woman to warn her of her husband's intentions. In the person of Miss LFBoyle, she offers him even more money to assassinate Mr. Walsh. He decides to leave while he's still in front, but when he drives out of town, he meets a man in the street. If he tries to continue, he takes the man to a hospital where he sees himself shot. Mr. Cage is being arrested by deputies calling the sheriff who turns out to be Mr. JTWalsh. The events take another complicated turn when Mr. Cage, run from custody, is run over by a real hit man strictly to fulfill his mission. On the screen, it appears as a completely logical turn of events, the narrative flow of the movie seems unstoppable at this point. Mr. D. Hopper is conveniently cast as the hired killer, as is Mr. Cage a USMC veteran. This little joke keeps Mr. Cage alive and survives the murderous trio and survives, a bit battered but still unbowed. It is a tribute to all those involved that what sounds strangely like nonsense on paper is actually a tense, exceptionally well-made image that performs well all round. "Red Rock West" is a movie lovers movie. Within five minutes, you know you're going somewhere where you've been many times, but you'll be very happy during the trip.
