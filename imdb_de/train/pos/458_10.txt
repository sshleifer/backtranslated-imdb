My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the show and can not wait to wait for the next one (hopefully there will be a sequel!). I would like to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I am "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If someone has the full text, please send it. <br /> <br /> One big reason why my wife and I loved this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but are still very intellectually active. It's great to see a show highlighting the social contribution older people with special skills and experience can still make. The aspect of human interest that shows the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very demanding, on a par with some of our favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
