(You'll know what I mean after seeing Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller. It starts slowly and slowly builds up. But when it's over, it's a robber. <br /> <br /> It's hard to pin down exactly what makes this thriller as exciting as I found it. Besides, to put it simply, the director has done a meritorious job of pulling you into the plot of an otherwise usual plot. I rather forgot that I saw a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the "closeness" of the victim and the villain ... and that over time you are really connected to the victim. A close to 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
