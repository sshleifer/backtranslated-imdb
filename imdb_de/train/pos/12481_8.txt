OK, so I do not see too many horror movies - and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this on a (surprisingly feature packed) DVD and it scared me off. The only thing I did not think was the DVD was indeed new pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone about it when I realized that I only saw about 10% of it. The rest of the time I had looked at the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my friend would catch me if I actually cover my eyes. The few times that I bravely looked at the screen, I had jumped so hard that I decided not to look up. <br /> <br /> The filming is solid and the characters' situation was really captivating. The simplicity of the movie has really taken hold of my jump button - it's just a forest, a cabin and a disused prison - and lots of darkness. For me, the most surprising thing was that it was obviously not a multi million dollar production, but the makeup effects really did look like! It's also obvious that this is a movie made by someone who loves filmmaking. The sound design and the music have really used my surround system, as has never been the case in many Hollywood movies. I've found online that this movie won the LA Shriekfest - a truly significant achievement, and I think the festival saw the filmmakers' clear talent - and probably much more of this film than I did. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the light and order a pizza if you want to keep your girlfriend.
