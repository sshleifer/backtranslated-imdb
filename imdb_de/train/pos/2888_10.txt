Any kid old enough to sit in front of a screen will be absolutely thrilled with the beautifully drawn pictures and the wonderful music in this warm and humorous rewriting of the Grimm fairytale. They will sing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence, and will continue it until their last days. It is a classic for all children, especially adults who are young.
