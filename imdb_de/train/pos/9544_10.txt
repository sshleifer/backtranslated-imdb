Meatball Machine is an amazing splatter movie, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that mutate humans into crazy robot war machines, people who love Splatter movies or the movie Tetsuo: The Iron Man welcome it. <br /> <br /> The special effects may be cheesy in some parts of the movie, but it is believed that the film is not taken very seriously. <br /> <br /> All in all, though, it's great fun You'll find emerging romantics who have been attacked by slimy tumors like gobbles and want to destroy themselves in bloody alien battles.
