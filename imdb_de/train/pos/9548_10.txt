It's an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Great work by Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to point out the play on the screen. In most films from Turkey, a script is not enough. But GEN has the best attitudes to be called "perfect." And transition parts are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a great theme that affects everyone. Especially a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium, has a mother, which is an ordinary madness. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in gene. The only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggression that Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played. This idea may be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
