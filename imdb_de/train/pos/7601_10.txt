Lost is unique ... it is so enchanting and full of excitement, thrills and emotions at the same time. I've never seen such a TV series before. It's full of jungle thrills and has a good script. The actors have experienced life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost looking at the island itself. It is an excellent piece that tells in a very intelligent way survivors lost on a desert island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another, and I recommend this series to all TV lovers. Watch the magic of being lost in nothing.
