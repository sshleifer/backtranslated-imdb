I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, first hard and then much easier with the progress. I spent my time at the height of the problems in NI and the Cold War. There were times when I questioned myself about what I had agreed to, not for a long time, because training would always take over and you would always instinctively respond. The voice used to show what the soldiers think is just right, although I would have added breath and heart rate, as this seems to beat in your drums in certain situations. A few years later, I was in Canada to meet a family. An aunt of mine who lives in the US and is a lecturer at Columbus University Ohio had given a lecture on the impact of the British Army in NI. She spent some time researching. Although she was an ex-pat, she was very anti-British. She chose me and condemned me as a British soldier. My only answer was the movie "A long day dying". It is the closest a civilian can realize why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right in the end.
