The Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the 30s than any denigration of the entire breed (despite the Stepin Fetchit cartoon). Besides the ones I just mentioned, there are also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies cartoon by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is musically very entertaining with perfect characteristics. They all sound so much like the real thing that half of me think they could possibly be. If not, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even the lazy, immobile fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when being chased by a tiger, while "Hold That Tiger" plays the score. Highly recommended for fans of the 30s animation and jazz music.
