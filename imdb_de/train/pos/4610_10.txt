On a winter's day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds are renting a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "Who is this Jackie Chan?", "I've never heard of him". Two hours later, after watching the movie, we wanted to know more about it. 16 years later (and totally out of my pocket when I was collecting JC movies!) The film still packs me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a thing for it, because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run) !! JC movie, but it is an excellent movie. It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it's outdated, it was made in 1985, of course it's outdated! But then Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and the Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Story, where would Hollywood action be today? PS has set standards, many scenes have been stolen for other films. To appreciate it properly, you have to see it in widescreen format, otherwise the movie lacks so much. (Yes, he really falls around the corner from the bus!). If you have not already done so, SEE THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
