I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, because it provides a refreshing view of dealing with the news of HIV in a family, with far less hysteria than what I've usually seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, but are not judgmental. Her desire to protect her youngest brother is noble, but in the end unnecessary. I understand that Leo's decision on how to handle his treatment was not the most popular with humans, but I believed that it was the right choice for him. I can not believe that this was a French television program. It had big production values. I gave this movie a ten and I think you will as well if you have seen it.
