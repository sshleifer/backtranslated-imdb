If you like Cleese and all the British Pythonesque humor of the time, this little gem is absolutely funny. Arthur Lowe is a real treat! I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out, and his classic quotes have been part of our jokes for 30 years and will do it forever! I have it on tape and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviewers take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that it is now available only in the US (NTSC of course) and not in the UK, where it should be an integral part of the history of British humor !!
