George Raft as Steve Brodie, the carefree, dancing player who can never refuse a challenge, faces up against the trampy, sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A gentle touch for every panhandler "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent foreigner with aspirations to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication takes place primarily in the form of violence (you can see why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Exploding cigars make for a running gag. "Swipes" enjoys throwing stones through windows in Chinatown, once at a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of Brodie's and Beery's volunteer firefighters leads to a brawl in which the building burns down.) Beery randomly beats off a bothersome girl and kills anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie whom he defeats in A nocturnal Fist fighting on a moored barge to regain control of his salon lost the bet that Brodie did not have the guts to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes the jump, but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment.) As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrating the daily life of the fillet with joy. Waiters sing, barmen harass, whores of Suicide Hall are shoved into the Black Maria, tailors drag unhappy hicks off the street, forcing them to buy suits they do not want. A small but admirable little movie.
