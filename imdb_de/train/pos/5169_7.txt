I saw the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999, one night, when I surfed the Channel before going to bed, and I liked what I saw. Since then, I've been searching for TV shows, flipping through DVD / VHS racks in the shops, but until recently, when I found out that some internet stores sold it. As a world-class Zauderer, I still have not ordered it. When I was in Portland, OR a few weeks ago, I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City. Then it was only about a month after I returned home before sitting down and looking at him. <br /> <br /> So, what do I think about the movie? It's good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth the $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the full movie for the first time, I rate it as 7/10, with the potential to become 8/10. I then have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch dialogues.
