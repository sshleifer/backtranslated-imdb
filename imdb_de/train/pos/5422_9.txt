The Story of the Untouchable, which acted like a great soldier and saved hundreds if not thousands of people, is told in the 1939 film Gunga Din. Based on the Rudyard Kipling poem, the film is brilliantly staged by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe, who worked in my time as Ben Caseys boss, dr. Zorba, was known. This name became synonymous with big, uncontrolled hair. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" to each of my generation, and they know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> At the time of the British occupation, three soldiers in India - two romantic, swift figures in Grant and Fairbanks and McLagen as a big catch - are dissections - in reality, three overgrown boys. Gunga Din is the water carrier who is somehow treated by McChesney (McLaglen) verbally anyway - but Cutter (Grant) loves him. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) making and saluting the soldier's unit during his maneuver, Cutter gives him some clues. <br /> <br /> The Musketeer's amusing group will part when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he is married to a pretty young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leaves the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter encounter Thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine insists on saving Cutter again. After all, it's a buddy movie. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins light-heartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, especially from Cary Grant, who is pretty funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so handsome that it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Much of the movie consists of huge action sequences that are very exciting. In the last part the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in an exciting fight. <br /> <br /> Grant has the most prominent role, Fairbanks is the lovesick romantic and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly because of his treatment of Gunga Din is the most unlikely character, although his soft heart is discovered in his love for his elephant Annie. His softness shows up at the end of the film, especially in the very touching, rousing final scene. <br /> <br /> Sam Jaffe is always a gentle and sympathetic actor, a brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and sublime dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe brings the soul of Gunga Din magnificently. <br /> <br /> This is truly the ultimate adventure movie with huge reach, good acting, stirring scenes, wonderful music and beautiful movies. Another from this remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.
