This film was not widely advertised here in Greece, even though it got good actors, good script and pretty good picture, in my country there is no so-called "blockbuster" movie. The movie itself is very powerful. It is the hard time a newcomer had to go through when he returned to his home village after a five-year prison sentence (drugs) (drugs). The end is pretty sad ... Mourikis tries to keep up with his role and he's pretty good with it ... Lambropoulou is strangely gorgeous and very sexy and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to excellence. .. 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
