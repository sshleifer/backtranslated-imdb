Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority that dominated South Africa, just as Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British Empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Freedom is not so much about Biko or apartheid as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a shattering perspective after Biko died in prison of consistent behavior by South African "police." Woods, played by Kevin Kline, has to decide if he does the right thing and flees the country to publish books on Biko, or if his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, allows him to force him to forget the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard, with the numbers escaping over the border yarn after Biko's death. Oscar nominee Denzel Washington is good only in his fourth movie as Biko, but in a movie that tries to portray the struggles of apartheid, it's a bit wrong by asking more than half of the movie more about the problems of a white one Family focused. Attenborough would have served his subject better if he had focused on Biko's ascent instead of starting where Biko befriended Woods. Maybe a black actor in a lead role in a two-and-a-half-hour big-ticket movie was not exactly conducive, but the movie was a massive box office flop anyway. Apart from the film policy, the film still has one or two messages, though in a PG-adjusted manner. *** of 4 stars.
