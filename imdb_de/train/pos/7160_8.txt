A Disney movie that dares to dare something else should at least be honored for its efforts. "Holes" do not make the same mistakes one would expect from a Disney movie about problematic teenagers being dumped in a camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. The Flashback scenes really have a purpose and present some mature themes that can surprise the viewer. I have to admit that the seriousness of the movie initially distracted me a bit. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to history, this film also questions some methods that are used in prisons. (An example where Caveman Zero is not allowed to teach reading because they have to dig holes to build a character, as learning to read does not help). "Holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. A must to look at it!
