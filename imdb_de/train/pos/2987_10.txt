This is the Tiny Beaches were never. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, I always seemed to be in a hurry to "feel it" (but the soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, is moving more slowly (and occasionally too slowly), and though it is somewhat manipulative in his tears' story about a devoted mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast show great accomplishments. 10/10
