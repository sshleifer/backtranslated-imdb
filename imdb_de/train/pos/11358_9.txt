The bad DVD video quality is the only reason why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. That could have been so much better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie that includes several topics simultaneously. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but are intrigued by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this movie is a must anyway. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "Silence" of the Lambs for a number of reasons: the way the serial killer is portrayed has been made much better in Citizen X. You will see some details of his private life because you're "traveling" with the killer, which gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger. Sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this movie: " Henry - Portrait of a serial killer. "If you were intrigued by this movie, you should definitely watch Citizen X.
