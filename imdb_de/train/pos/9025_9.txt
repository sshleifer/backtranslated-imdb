The film belongs to the genre Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little bit of theatrical momentum to the story with some standard elements. Well filmed, well cut, with many well-played supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Some have declared this film a classic American hokey. It is that and more. I agree with those who say, "The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that performance can be born from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
