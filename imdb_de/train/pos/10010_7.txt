There are many diseases born in the mind of man, brought to life in modern times. Through constant vigilance or accumulated information in the area of ​​pyschosis, psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists have been busy enough to survive decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who have no knowledge of their remedy or their existence. That's the premise of the movie "The Night Listner". It tells the story of a popular radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends his evenings enthusing his audience with lively stories about gay lifestyles. Maybe because his show loses its authentic veneer, which makes Noon admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks protection in his deeper despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches for the desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Noon is excited and wants to help by reading the boy's harrowing manuscript depicting the early life and sexual abuse of his brutal parents. However, things are not what they seem, and Noon soon finds himself in an elusive and bizarre story torn from a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and if Toni Collette did not play Donna D Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this could be funny. Instead, this could be one of William's more serious performances. ***
