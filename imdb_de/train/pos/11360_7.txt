Chris Gerolmo has made sure that we do not just give a list of murdered people named "Jack-the-stripper": he has dealt convincingly with psychological characterization. Perhaps also because of the outstanding performance of Stephen Rea, who played against Donald Sutherland with much empathy from both. It was the game of these two parts? above all ?? This made the movie something more than just a morbid representation of the history of the butcher of Rostov. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, has done a great job. Good direction The photography was good too. Of course, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary had to produce some deviations, but given the depth of narration and interpretations, we can completely forget these little trivia. <br /> For once, a TV-made movie by HBO has produced trumps. Recommended, especially if you want to study the characteristics and forget some of the painful scenes? but I would like to add, are never exaggerated.
