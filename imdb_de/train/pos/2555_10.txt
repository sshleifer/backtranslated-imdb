The movie was not great. The book is better. But the movie was not that bad. It was interesting, to say the least. The plot had enough excitement to keep me watching, though I would not say I was actually interested in the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both great enough to keep you watching :) They have some cute scenes that should appeal to the romantic. All in all, I would give the movie a 7 or 8. It was not bad.
