Istanbul is by no means a masterpiece and far from Errol Flynn's best value, Istanbul still has much to offer. The film locations and the beautiful Technicolor cinematography take us back to a bygone era. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past fame and is fine when Jim Brennan, a pilot who has a past to pursue him. The picture is actually a remake of "Singapore" from 1947, and history seems terribly invented and cliched by today's standards. Many of the other visitors also seem to be "walking through the movements" in this picture. Many people have compared it to one of the greats, CASABLANCA. While I saw the movie, I saw many similarities, but Casablanca has inspired innumerable imitators, so take what it's worth. Finally, if you're a fan of Flynn or old-fashioned love stories, you might want to watch this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon as a good introduction to some of Hollywood's classics.
