One of the best movies out there. Yes, maybe the camera was not the best, but an excellent plot and an excellent concept. Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. A little different from the usual movies and a lot of fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative films. After World War III and in battle with gigantic robots, the actors did a great job making the whole thing worthwhile. The sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it, because I loved it since it came out. No mainstream strip and nothing you've ever seen. Look and think like a child. It is a great view and very funny.
