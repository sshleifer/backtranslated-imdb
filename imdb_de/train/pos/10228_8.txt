As a huge monster fan I was "to see Yeti" an absolute must, especially after I had heard so much about it. Thanks to the good old market, I could easily find a copy and was happily surprised to find that, in fact, I think this film is decent. <br /> <br /> Decent what it is, Actually a kitschy giant monster movie. It seems pretty fast, because Yeti is found pretty fast and we get to know different characters. They are made up of some bad ones, some good ones, and a girl who is by far one of the most striking girls in a cheesy sci-fi movie. Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight from the original Woodstock concert, and basically he's not a bad guy, especially after being introduced to some kind of funky cage-like thing in the world. Godzilla is not him - despite his rude awakening he does not even rage (in fact he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but he seems somehow confused when trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English quite well (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good and the bad are. <br /> <br /> But we want the huge Yeti to do his thing, and it's him. It's pretty much the whole movie and in typical low-budget way, he seems to change his size depending on the scene, and it There are even a number of "false legs" in which he just stands. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the best, but there are definitely some good ones. A scene where Yeti is smashed by a warehouse is very well done, and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder stairs to climb from top to bottom. Each window is shattered with the foot and the inmates are often shaken - in a sequence that looks really much, much better than it should be in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never tends to be as deep as "APE". does. In fact, the only time it comes close to real stupidity is when the pretty girl straightens Yeti's nipple and raises his eyebrow in an "oh yeah baby" manner. But that's not so bad, and the audience even laughs a bit. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long for something like that, but surprisingly it does not get boring - the movie The story is really good, and if you look at this incredibly beautiful actress on screen, every male viewer will be happy , <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the top tier of huge monster flicks, but it's definitely better than other King Kong '76 rip offs like "APE" and "Queen Kong" by far.
