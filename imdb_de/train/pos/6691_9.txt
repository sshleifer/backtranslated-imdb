This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it special is two things: First, how the characters embrace the stereotypes with their costumes and superpowers. The parody is of a lovable seriousness that is very appealing. The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special attention as the target of Mr. Furious's wishes. There are quite a few talents here. I know that some have been disappointed with high expectations, but this movie is fun and somehow sweet.
