First of all, I would like to say that I am very satisfied with this highlight of the Bourne Trilogy. Please, oh, please do not ruin it by doing the next years or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right ... moving. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems he should only play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Bourne films, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was delighted to see how well all the information we receive in "Identity" and "Supremacy" meshed in "Ultimatum" to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of the seat. The battles between Bourne and the assassins are always fun. I've always been a fan of CIA agent movies and how the CIA brings their Intel together and this movie is right on this street, which makes it even more exciting for me ultimatum, without seeing the previous 2 installments ... you will Still enjoy the movie thoroughly, but I would still recommend you to watch it first. This would allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne, become connected and become part of his world. So you can appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first two, but I personally think that "ultimatum", POSSIBLE, could have the advantage of comparing the trilogy.
