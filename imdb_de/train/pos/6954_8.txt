This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and the laughter of the audience supports me. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) was the laughter so spontaneous and intense. Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) easily got involved in the parody game (Spying on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Sex on My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Ivan Reitman, the director between comedy and drama, between crazy and downright ridiculous, is great. Never can shock and dramatic seriousness break the rule of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the ending is broadcast beforehand. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it develops. As in real life, the truth is sometimes so obvious that you can not really see it. With Tootsie (1982), eight out of ten stars are at the top. Maybe a nine (depends on how it appears in a second consideration).
