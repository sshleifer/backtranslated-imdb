This is one of the best movies. It is one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work too. <br /> <br /> The names of the actors and actors are not on the American star list. However, they offer the same or better performance than the best in the list. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance and friendship without having to endure someone who has a kickboxing their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, you have no heart and no feelings. Then have a look at a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. Watch the movie. It is a must. TH
