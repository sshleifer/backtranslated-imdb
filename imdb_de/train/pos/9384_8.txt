An excellent example of "cowboy noir," as it was called, in which jobless Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses his job because he insists on being honest (he has a big leg). Since he can do nothing else, he decides that he will lie once. When he goes to a bar and the owner Wayne (the late, great JT Walsh) condemns him for a batsman whom Wayne has hired in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays along and accepts Waynes' Money. Then he goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husband's intentions and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that does not make things complicated enough, the real hit man "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) pops up and Michael has more problems than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" brings a lot from the venues. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, has recognized the potential of a story in a truly isolated small town that may already have seen better times and in which residents could be involved in any way. It's also an amusing idea of ​​the kind of trouble an honest person could come in contact with if she chose to give up her principles and surrender to any temptation. It's a strangely dark and confused story with a number of main characters who, if not corrupt, are morally compromised, at least like Michael. The lighting of the cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is excellent in his mood; Even the culmination of a cemetery gives the whole thing a beautiful morbid quality. Although the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the film has a nice way to fascinate the viewer and simply draw it. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in the lead role, but his co-stars have a great old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greedy-motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are fun in these areas. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor excellently qualify as Walshs MPs (in a particularly good twist, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there's also an entertaining cameo role for Country & Western star Dwight Yoakam, who also made the film enjoyable The credits honor the melody. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good little movie worth seeing. It moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else, it certainly will never get boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
