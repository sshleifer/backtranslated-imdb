This movie has made me very happy. It is impossible not to love the clever and sweet orphan that changes the heart of a selfish lawyer who is only interested in pursuing success in his career. This is a very optimistic movie, and I sincerely believe that we need more movies like Curly Sue. It touched my heart.
