This movie is very entertaining and never boring, even though it runs for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and very believable. The violence in the film was a bit extreme, but then it became clear how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film. The end is amazing and is one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.
