When I was 17, Bye Bye Birdie staged my high school - which is not a big surprise as it's perfect high school material and is supposedly the most staged musical in the world. The students kept strong memories of the production and their songs, as well as a long-standing disregard for the film version of Dick Van Dyke, who darkened the Elvis references (intentionally) and camped for a buoyant 1960s audience When the 1995 release hit my cable TV screen with Jason Alexander, I was pleased me about what I saw. Alexander shows an extraordinary performance as Albert, a performance that differs greatly from his better known personality from a particular TV series. The rest of the cast is entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not perform her role, supposedly a naive and innocent student). <br /> <br /> But the best thing is the musical numbers that are known from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as musical stage songs (so no stage is present). <br /> <br /> So if you know the musical (and few do not), then watch this telemovie. The stage shows justice in a way that is unlikely to improve, which is good enough for me. What is better than to represent the work of a writer faithfully and with color and style?
