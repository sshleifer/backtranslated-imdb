Hello, I was Alanrickmaniac. I am still crazy. It was just another movie that I partly watched on TV. Then I had to get the videotape to find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD because the tape showed signs of deterioration after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to touch the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and the script. At the moment, it's getting even worse that I'm trying to get other people into my addiction with my website and the "Still Crazy" parties. <br /> <br /> How could that happen? What drove me into addiction? <br /> <br /> OK, it's one of those funny, but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies that only the British can produce. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is worlds apart from stuff like "This Is Spinal Tap" because of the characters that are not childish or ultracool, but real. This is also a story about aging men. A story about men who get along. Or not. It contains some of the best actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, who plays one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Good, the soundtrack is amazing. Foreigner Mick Jones wrote the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy and portrays the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms, really sings. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you only hear Bill Nighy's "Love Actually," you do not know how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you'll be thrilled for every scene for the umpteenth time, especially for those concert scenes. You would die to really be in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit plays "All Over The World" and sings on the lungs. They long to celebrate the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit on the stage of Wisbech with thousands of people. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I am addicted to strange fruits. If there is a world where this band really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Still crazy ... anyone?
