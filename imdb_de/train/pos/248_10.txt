'Ned Kelly' is a wonderfully made Australian movie that honors a true Australian hero. We are taken to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of Kelly Gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an extraordinary cast, all of which perform outstandingly, bringing the film to life. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe and played the role of the quiet, loyal lady man very well. I was swept along at the moment. For a moment I almost thought the gang would win the battle at Glenrowan, unfortunately it should not be. Some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), it was somewhat disappointed. Maybe the movie could have taken longer to tell more about the life of Kelly Gang / Ned - I had the feeling that not enough was covered. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some shortcomings, this is a moving movie that moves all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I'd assume this movie should be better viewed than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned).
