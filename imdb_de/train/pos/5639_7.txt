I've read the other reviews and found that there's a comparison between the movie and real life (like what it means to get into music school), Britney bashing, and so on. So we focus on the movie and the message. > <br /> I rated this film 7 out of 10 at the age of 8 to 14 years and for a family movie. For the average grown man ... 2 of 10 <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I know Britney Spears, but never noticed that she sang Stronger until I read credits and those reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I was not worried about "self-promotion." <br /> <br /> I watch movies to be entertained. I do not care about casting, lighting, producers, directors etc. What is the movie and does he entertain me? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because of the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is the low self-esteem (which is a very different story) that has been observed with the message in mind as this is a field of interest. The film is light, light and airy, ideal for children. I found that the Texas twang faded throughout the movie, and of course there are so many ways to give up giving up / not giving up bot, so it was a bit predictable. Great message ... should be more of it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a guy who's watching alone, Hannibal gets.
