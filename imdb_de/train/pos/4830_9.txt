Although some reviews were clearly Luke-warm, I found the story totally compelling and although some critics have described the love story as "Mills and Boon," what then? It's good to see a warm, touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and dabbed their eyes. They truly believe that young Victoria and Albert love each other passionately, though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage. However, I felt that Sir John Conroy, desperate to control the young queen, might also be played like a pantomime villain. It is believed that he was actually the real father of Victoria (due to an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent), it would have been interesting to investigate this theory. Emily Blunt convinces as a young princess who is trapped in the stuffy palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate them. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, thriving like never before under her long reign. I believe word of mouth referrals will be a great success for this extremely enjoyable and beautiful looking movie.
