I saw last night after not seeing it for several years. It's really a funny little movie, with a few faces that you did not know were in it. Arkin shines as always. Listen; You will not be disappointed. It was just released on DVD, by the way, and unlike its packaging, it's widescreen. The transfer is rather bad, but at least the WHOLE movie is visible. ;-)
