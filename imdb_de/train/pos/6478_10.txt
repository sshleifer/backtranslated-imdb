Although this has been said from the British point of view, it is the best documentary of the Second World War ever produced. Presented in digestible episodes (as digestible as war can be), Laurence Olivier's solemn voice joins the crowd of eyewitnesses forced to witness the events of that terrible time. Eagerly waiting for his DVD appearance in the US. The Europeans had a DVD release earlier this year.
