"The Days" is a typical family drama with a small hook - you have to refer in every way to the emotions of the character, so you really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show] <br /> <br /> The story is obvious to all the people who have seen the show, the world of Cooper Day , the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes one day to become a rich and famous writer based on his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a brilliant little brother. The first episode that sounds a little stupid since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and the mother are getting pregnant. This is the first situation the author encounters. Then the father gives up his job at the law office. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets into a fight with the sister's friend. That's all in one day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ spoiler] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I dont know. It's a bit crappy, but I like it. At first I thought the camera work was a rip-off, but then I got used to it and started liking it. I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate feel of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the acting. I admire the story. Then I want a second season of The Days. I was slowly becoming a fan of it when the 6-episode of ABC was broadcast. It's a really good show and it's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans will not compare them anymore. <br /> <br /> And if you can refer to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll like this show. A lot of.
