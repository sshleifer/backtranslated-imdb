I'm a fan of C & C, who returns to his records, and liked this movie, but sometime in the mid-eighties on cable television in San Jose, California, he was broadcast with an alternate storyline that destroyed the entire site of the movie. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag "Red" on Chong contains diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation stays the same ("... it's ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot where clips of aliens were added on a ship, C & C were watching and talking to each other about preserving the diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke" is something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and obvious that they tried to make them family / kid friendly. It would have been better if this network had not broadcast it at all.
