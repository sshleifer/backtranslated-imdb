It turned out to be a first-class production on a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from ax-swinging dwarves to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental, but romantic enough to sustain interest. I also liked the mix of humor (which can easily be wrong, too much / not enough), which means it was neither too dark nor too fake. It was a big step ahead of the other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website worth visiting. I can not wait for Bane, if the improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
