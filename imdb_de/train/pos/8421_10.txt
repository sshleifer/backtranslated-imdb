Josef Von Sternberg directs this great silent film about silent Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Tsar of Russia there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, partly for his role as general, ironically cast as a Russian general in a silent picture. The film looks back on his time in Russia, which led to a fall of the country to revolutionaries. William Powell makes his debut on the big screen as a Hollywood director, who occupies Jannings in his film. The film offers an interesting insight into the fall of Russia and an imitation of Tinseltown behind the scenes in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers another classic filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
