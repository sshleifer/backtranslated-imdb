The version I saw in this movie was the blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a dirty word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was damn funny. It also agreed with the bone. If you've ever been to Hollywood or the surrounding area, you'll understand the humor. If not, you can not "get it" at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the industry struggling to make it until they finally reach a break point makes it a rare gem. Although it is said to be a drama, it is a drama, just as Deer Hunter is a comedy. Loren Dean is as always wonderful as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy did well. His performance is particularly impressive in the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can not have everything.
