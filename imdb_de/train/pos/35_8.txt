When I saw the elaborate DVD box and the terrible Red Queen figure, I was sure that I would experience a great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Obvious nonsense of course and unforgivable, that such a complicated solution should be hounded so fast that the subtitles can hardly be read, let alone the ridiculous explanation. Apart from the fact that the movie is a dream. Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful surroundings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He may not be Morricone, but he might as well be in those lighter pieces. Really enjoyable with a lot of color, lots of sexiness, a few bloody kills and minimal police intervention. Super.
