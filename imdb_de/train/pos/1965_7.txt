I found this movie very good in all areas. The drama was brilliant of all characters, especially Ms. Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character becomes smarter and more psychological by the minute. The plot is interesting, though this film is more for the mind that plays between the main characters and how Catherine continues writing for her novels with new ways and phrases. The setting was also fabulous and the entire atmosphere of the movie was a mysterious, thriller-like masterpiece. Look at this movie now, it deserves better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some flawed, horrible reviews of the movie (before it even started) ... you will not regret it if You see it ...
