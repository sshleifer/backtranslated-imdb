This is the second movie I've seen of Ida Lupino as a director after the hitchhiker of the 53s. I think this one was a better movie than this. This girl has a girl who wants to marry soon, and then she is sexually abused. It does not like everyone to look and talk about them, so they run away and get taken in by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is correct, just to give 2 and 1/2 stars.
