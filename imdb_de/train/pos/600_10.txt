Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who tramps a thousand miles to visit his absent millionaire (the scary Ray Wise) on a sprawling, windmill-run ranch and lands in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother (the delicious Clare Wren), which causes problems for the already dysfunctional family. A chic, stylish and exciting drama that did not receive commercials and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I first saw it. It's beautifully written, cleverly handled and strictly referenced by a script that bites your nails. I can not believe the critics who did not like it actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.
