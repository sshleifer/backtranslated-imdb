This movie is one of many "Kung Fu" movie films made in Asia in the late 70's and early 80's, featuring cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue, and lightning fast martial arts action. But unlike most movies in the genre, it also has a decent storyline and a lot of great comedy. When workers at a dyeing factory are forced by Manchu thugs to stop working, they hire a competitor (Gordon Liu) to try to deter them. If his attempt fail miserably, he moves into a Shaolin Temple to learn how to really fight. Instead of making him a kungfu disciple, Master instead commands him to build a scaffold that covers the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that as he completes these small tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles), he learns the skills to be a kung fu expert! It's a bit like Karate Kid as Mr. Miagi Daniel teaches the basics of karate by doing routine household chores - "waxing up, waxing down" and so on. There's a lot of great comedy from start to finish and lots of action in the end as Gordon Liu faces his Manchu tormentors once again. "This time it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu knocks proudly on his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss them!
