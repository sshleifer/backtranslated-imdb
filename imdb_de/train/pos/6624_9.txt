I highly recommend this movie. Located in the Bladerunner future of Paris in 2054, it is primarily a classic film noir script: Lady in Danger, sister trying to find her. Fortunately, stereotypes are avoided and a pretty good story combined with interesting, innovative visuals. The movie may be reminiscent of Sin City in look, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic look that I find really intriguing. Every frame, every sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk by an experienced graphic designer. In terms of history and artwork, you'll find nodding from the '40s (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca as well as a grim future in which our goals are ruled by corporations. Make an apology to watch this movie.
