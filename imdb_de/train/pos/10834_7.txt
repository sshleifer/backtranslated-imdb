I did not approach "Still Crazy" with real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll image, I thought ... good nostalgia for the baby boomers. This movie is partly like that, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously staged a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style. I think it's fitting that this was his last movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as frontman of the band. Bruce Robinson, director and director, joins the band as guitarist. He does a great job, although he has not appeared in the movie since the late '70s. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you have found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
