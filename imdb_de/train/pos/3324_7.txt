Someone mastered the difficult task of combining sport with romance. In reality, sport and romance merge like oil and water. To put the two together successfully on the screen, this is about splitting the atom. I never thought it would be possible. I'll be the first to say that I generally do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most movies about sports. This movie was a pretty good mix of both. As a baseball fanatic, I really appreciated the comic ordeal of Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a great Boston Redsox fan. Anyone familiar with baseball knows the bane of the baby who was bothering Redsox for 86 years, and they know how crazy baseball is to many Redsox fans. The Farrely brothers did a great job making this a good comedy. This was a very good movie that many could enjoy.
