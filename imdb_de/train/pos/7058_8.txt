Shortly after I saw the movie, the true magical feeling of the Walt Disney movies came to me, and I realized that I had seen the "real" magic in a movie a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The combination of the right music, speeches and magical effects brings the Disney feeling back into your body. I've seen very special things where the unknowing effects in the movie started with the Disney logo turning into the Cinderella Castle, ending up as an old story telling the fairy tale with your grandparents. The magic has returned to me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
