I do not know if it contains spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk being blacklisted by 3462. I agree with the commentary of the viewer, the Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". You can not have seen the same series as me. <br /> <br /> The series * I * saw the history of European colonization in America and southern Africa without any particular inaccuracies. I have not seen anything in the series that depicted Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, even though Europeans * often * were lucky - and fortune is not wrong. Nor did I see any aborigines portrayed as poor little innocent things. If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - one would expect to be a leader in dealing with foreigners if his country had not been remembered by another world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly saw nothing that could be interpreted as a Marxist or Neo-Marxist except through the incredibly elastic ideas. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples * have * built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. By the time they were at the peak of their accomplishments, the civilizations of the Aztecs, Mayas and Incas * had advanced as far as any other in the world - and just as rich; sometimes more. The Native Americans and the Khoi-San population * were * decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans. Just as the European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi San peoples are completely different from any other sub-Saharan Africa). <br /> <br /> So I do not see what other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series does not tell me anything I did not know until the end of seventh grade. There really is no new historical information in this film. However, it offers some beautiful dramatizations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and it fills a few holes here and there that were not covered in Mrs. Gruber's Sixth Hour Social Studies class at the Milan Middle School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, you assume that you were decent. At primary and / or secondary level you do not learn anything new, but you have a nice and entertaining time to check what You have already learned (or should have learned) at high school.
