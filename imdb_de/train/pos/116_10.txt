Man oh man ... I foolishly misbehaved (not the right term, there is a long list!) To watch this movie, and finally had the opportunity. And "News" is: Wonderful Labyrinth Spectacle! <br /> <br /> For each of Trier's "followers": both Rigs, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, The Five Obstacles, etc. Europe is probably the visual difference in size. Everything is pretty dark and claustrophobic! You really have the feeling of being in this "imaginary", nightmarish time distortion. Starting with the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, up to Noir films of the 40s with acid drops Avantgarde von Trier lead the art film scene as "well-meaning totalitarian" filmmaker of today. His authoritarian handling of very complicated subjects, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intention of healing some of the deepest wounds we feel in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As utopian as it seems I think people like von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader sense. The daily movies and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer necessary as a means of reflection, maybe it could be a new era: "The Age of Emotional Control of Our Fears". He constantly offers us this through his work. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
