This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! <br /> <br /> It's not an idealistic movie, I would say that it shows life as it was in the 60s and 70s. The main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but also have some "dark" pages, which makes you think they are real people. Great movie with great actors that shows that life is not always funny, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion", as Gigi would say.
