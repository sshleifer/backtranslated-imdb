I really like this show. So I was disappointed when I learned recently that George Lopez is a racist and he fired Masiela Lusha from the show just because he found out that she was not a Latino emigrant, but an Albanian emigrant. I learned that from people on the show. She was really one of the better parts of the show, and so to learn that even among those who are thought to be responding to racism, they can hate someone just because the country they were born into it really is disappointing.
