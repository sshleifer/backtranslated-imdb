John Thaw is a great actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his role in the role of a crunchy old Curmudgeon, who reluctantly agreed to take on an evacuee from the streets of London (World War II era). The film is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are somewhat underdeveloped (especially the school teacher), but none of them are essential to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie needs little more.
