The only word that summarizes this film is quirky. It is a carefree play through an existential concept. bouncy (in more ways than one) and a little bit crazy. I would not call it a great and memorable cinema and it does not seem to be as catchy as the director's first movie "cube". Acting sometimes changes from serious to annoying, but I think it was the way it should be written. Made as a serious movie, it might have been great, or very likely put into a state of entitlement. A bit like "The Matrix" meets "Head" meets "Human Nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
