I had been electrified when I saw it for the first time in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko has gone halfway through the film, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom will not be forgotten. When I was in South Africa in 1993, it's also largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and I heard the audience sang on a dance night in Natal Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, I heard my hair on the ends. There is much to learn from this story for all peoples.
