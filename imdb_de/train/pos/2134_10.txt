Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of films that will live forever, as is the case with The Shop Around the Corner. This film has been rebuilt into other lesser-known films and a musical game without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own and definitive version. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together in several films. Her characters in this film are an example of how to be in a movie without almost acting as an actor. Both stars are as adorable as the pen pals who do not know each other, but fate made them collaborate in the same store in Budapest. The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supportive occupations that assemble the studios frame by frame. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan playing the shopkeeper. We also see, among others, Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, who do an impressive job in making us believe that they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these movies will live forever!
