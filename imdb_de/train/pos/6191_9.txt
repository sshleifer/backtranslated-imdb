It seems that Hal Hartley's films are a hit or a miss to most viewers. This movie is no exception to this rule. Fay Grim acts as a continuation of Hartley's "Henry Foole" from 1998. The focus this time is on Henry's ex-wife (perfectly played by the ever-welcome Parker Posey), who is plagued by CIA colleagues over Henry's unpublished book about all of this dodgy shops. In the meantime, Fay gets into an odyssey, deals with international spies, etc. The film gets a little embarrassed in the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, you should not miss it. For the first beginner of Hartley, who has only heard of his technique, you should look at his earlier films before dealing with them (especially if you have not yet seen "Henry"). I admired the camera work that sometimes reminded me of certain early man-ray photography.
