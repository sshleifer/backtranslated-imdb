This is one of the best Hong Kong (action) films ever and has a thrilling and exciting story as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has everything, romance, drama, excitement and a great hero. It's the only martial arts movie that interested me in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. Sammo Fans- This is a must (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
