I once lived with a roommate who had attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty-dollar noise from sneezing after midnight. <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure if it works. Overall, the descent of the Polanski character into paranoia and madness, which takes about the last half hour, is quite bitter and bizarre. Ebert was absolutely unconvinced and hit the film with a diabolical critique of a star. But I think that individual scenes and moments work wonderfully, even if I do not quite understand the whole movie - what does egyptology have to do with it? - I still have a positive impression of it. <br /> <br /> I like the disgusting friend of Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I decided to have stupid friends instead of no friends at all! I love the cinema scene - the funniest moment in movie history I would say. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so fake in this movie, that's almost unbelievable. And she's doing a great job, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor. I disagree with the occasionally derogatory remarks about his performance here. His character should be restrained and thoughtful, so fits his restrained performance. I personally found him perfectly likeable - though he lost me a bit when he did not pull himself into a suit for any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dark. And slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of housing life - something that I've totally overemphasized - so I dig it. It's funny how all you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly such a spinner movie becomes very important! Definitely worth a change of pocket on DVD.
