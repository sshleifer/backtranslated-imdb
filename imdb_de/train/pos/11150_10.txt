I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" and thought it was another overrated movie from the 60s / 70s. Some of my favorite 70's movies are similar to "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Drivers", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many, many overvalued ones that are excellent among critics Reputation as groundbreaking - unfortunately, the vast majority of them are not feeling well today. I somehow feel like "Easy Rider". (Although it's one of my favorites as well.) So I did not expect much from Midnight Cowboy, but got a lot back. It's a touching story, well done and narrated with some of the best performances ever. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he talks - maybe because of the Lenny / "Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is absolutely convincing. Half of the film budget went toward his salary as he became a star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-fastest Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who drives north to the Big Apple to become a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways get in trouble and he pairs with a crippled cheater named "Ratso" - who volunteers to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of the profit. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long at two hours, but never seems to be very long. Some films tend to pull, especially some of the films filmed in the '70s because the directors (as stated in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") were the stars of the movies in the' 70s and occasionally one Something too baffled with their material, too long studied characters / scenes / etc. that's not important. Almost the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - they make the movie look extremely outdated (much like on the drug Odysseys in "Easy Rider") and really harms his flow because he is not needed /> <br /> Apart from that, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost flawless movie. I was positively surprised. It has its faults (flashbacks are a bit cheesy and never used as they might have been), and some scenes are a bit uneasy (like the gay movie sequence), but if you can handle their content " Midnight Cowboy "is a really great movie, an uncompromising study of the street life of the late 60s / early 70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards, the liberal perspective of "Life is terrible, etc ..." may seem a bit dated and heavy ... but I still love it, and most of all, the extremely touching ending is for I have a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (It was technically released in late 1969, but I would still classify it as a 1970s movie.) It also won the Best Picture Oscar, the first - and only -) X-rated film to do so. It was later re-rated R in the appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4,5 / 5
