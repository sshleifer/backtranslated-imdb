It is immensely helpful to know the culture and the period in which the film takes place. Above all, these ladies are not geisha, they are Oiran (prostitutes) in the "green houses" of the Yoshiwara type (about 1860), give or take. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and above all how people deal with adversity, both with their own and with others in their immediate environment. This and the outrageous photography together with the breathtakingly beautiful music make for a nice ride. Just plug it in, pick up your unbelief and enter your world. You will not be disappointed.
