Loved Joan. Good performance. What is not good for you. I saw this movie and then Jane Eyre right after that ... it's getting better and better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Exactly what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I am glad that I have it on video. I do not know what you need in a movie anymore. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... A test ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very nice , I wonder what the budget for this movie was? I wish they still made movies. Whenever they try, they just seem to make a cheesy movie. Films in black and white still harbor a certain mystery.
