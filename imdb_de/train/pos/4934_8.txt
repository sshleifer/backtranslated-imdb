"Panic in the Streets" is a rather unknown short film by director Elia Kazan and shot in front of his classic masterpieces like "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan won an Oscar in 1947 before this film, so he was not completely unknown at the time. Still, "Panic in the Streets" is mostly a movie under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning script. It has a very good concept and its excellent, tense Thriller material with a touch of crime / film noir elements. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely great and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is fairly unknown (especially at the time it was released), but it still contains Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first film roles. Especially Palance impresses as a tough gangster boss with a very powerful-looking face. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie does get a bit weaker in some places. The movie starts off very well, but after the start, the movie slows down and does not always make the right decisions about the tempo and the point of view from which the story is told. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, "Panic in the Streets" remains a perfectly predictable film, mainly because of its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the film believable. For fans of the thriller genre, this is a great movie you can watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
