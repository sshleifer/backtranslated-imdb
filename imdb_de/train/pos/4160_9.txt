One word can describe this movie and that's weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old. I thought it would be interesting. Well, the movie is about a boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can take revenge. On the way he encounters very colorful characters and ultimately has to decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation / science fiction, you should take a look.
