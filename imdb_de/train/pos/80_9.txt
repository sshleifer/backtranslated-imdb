I really enjoyed the reunion! I would have rated it 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". It was not even mentioned where they are today or why they did not participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters, and I think it was a mistake not to explain their missing appearance. <br /> <br /> I was glad that TNN ran the series again! I had been looking for episodes for years and what a pleasure to record the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
