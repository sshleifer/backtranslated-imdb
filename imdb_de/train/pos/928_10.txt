I had seen as much of the series as I could see on TV, but unfortunately I started a job that got me working in the evening. I was able to capture at least a few shots of it ... and, of course, bought the recently released full-length DVD. If you look at the DVD, you will see that the animation was a bit rough at first, but after the pilot was done some bugs were fixed. The voices are well matched to the characters and the writing is excellent. It's refreshing to see animations return to their roots by reintroducing adult themes. With the way society has emerged in the last century, it's necessary to be a little bit blatant today to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are in situations that correspond to those we often face in real life. It's a typical sitcom in that respect, but the humor is more like what's expected of late night television such as a talk show sketch or Saturday Night Live ... back when SNL was actually funny. Good job, Dreamworks. Maybe you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going ... and also to improve the merchandise for the series to reduce the high cost. However, it is a challenge to do this for a caricature of mature nature. Hmm ...
