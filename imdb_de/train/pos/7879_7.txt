Like most of Eleanor Powell's films, this film deals with the toughest actions. For some reason - oh, it is explained! - She decided to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good and bad guys fight for the mine and who gets confusing. But as always Powells dance is excellent and worth the entrance. And here Lahr plays his cowardly lion and remembers the Technicolor movie of 1939. A small relief is that he hears a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and his meager vulnerability, which he later gave up for his Person of the Wise. In addition, great drummer Buddy Rich has a wonderful time showing his virtuosity. Pay special attention to his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpet player Ziggy Elman. I say "maybe" in ignorance, but I do not know any other drum / trumpet sequence like this on film or records. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's goofy personality is relatively restrained. Powell shows again that she is the biggest dancer ever.
