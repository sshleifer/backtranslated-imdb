I thought that would be a wonderful movie. It touches every fiber of a human. The love in the film is very intense. I thought that it was Will's best performance so far. Great director. Did the editing music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie everyone should see. I hope people get something wonderful from it. Overall, an excellent movie. I think Hollywood should make more films with substance. Even action movies can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a devotion that is rarely seen. I would suggest looking at this alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I realized that the world stopped and I focused only on the film. The outside world was closed for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all the chaos that is going on in this world. And with this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cared more about people than about him.
