This funny line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny under its own conditions and unintentionally pretty funny.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they too bad! One is given for pinup poses and blatant comments wherever she goes. The other guy got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has these sensual, slightly failed lips. And to give away nothing, she is even worse than the others. All three sisters are played by asterisks. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had a career. <br /> <br /> This looks like the first mainstream softcore porn ever came on the market. Well, of course not the first, but the most racial of the time. <br /> <br /> The girls wear as little as possible and do not forget the female spectators: Bromfield shaves with an electric shaver - whose fetish was that? - naked torso. He is also shown wet in a bathing suit. <br /> <br /> There is a real conspiracy here as well: the girls' family is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can act like suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main target. The women are sparsely dressed. They often resemble lime-like covers of magazines such as Police Detective or Jackets of Dime novels. <br /> <br /> But the guy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is meant for that too. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and also on your own terms.
