This reminded me of Spinal Tap on a more serious level. It's the story of a band doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious. I was particularly impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray. They felt sorry for him, but he had a certain horror. It's a great movie you can see if you've ever seen your favorite band crumpled, old, and pathetic. Bittersweet, highly recommended.
