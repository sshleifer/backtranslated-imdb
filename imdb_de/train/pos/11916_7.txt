With all the "adult" introductions in today's family movies, it's nice to see one you do not have to worry about and just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids. Yeah, this movie might have some bad words (at that time Knox swears, but you can not hear all the words), but for the most part the movie is as clean as it comes (and includes) movies from earlier in the day) , Not only that, it's very pleasant, one of my favorites, and just a great, clean and funny movie that you can watch with your family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short. I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are contained in it, I will not mention it because I do not want spoilers here. <br /> <br /> All in all nicely done and a great movie to watch; So go out and get the kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!
