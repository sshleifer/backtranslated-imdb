Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss when it really is a story about being alone. Some people may never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles character Johnson reflects the total opposite of Sandler's figure Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful addition to the cast and Sandler pulls the tears. Cheadle had the funny part and was a great supporter for Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars here somewhere. A very nice movie. If you have ever lost and felt alone, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. Jerry
