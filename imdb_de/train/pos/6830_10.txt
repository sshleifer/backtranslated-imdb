Many reviews here explain the story and the characters of 'Opening Night' in detail so I do not do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the movie is a wonderful life affirmation. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Myrtle Gordon remembers how "easy" it was when she was 17, as she did that, youth and energy and the feeling of knowing the truth. The experience has made her emotionally fragile and wondered what her life was for and whether she could still live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and asserts herself ("I'll bury this bastard," she says on stage by fellow actor Maurice). It almost seems sadistic when Myrtle's director stops people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first appearance. He knows, however, that she has to have the courage to do it herself, if she can do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary break on the downhill path of Myrtle. I think that's really her "opening night" - she opens like a flower for new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It moves enormously. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is outstanding. The movie is outstanding. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
