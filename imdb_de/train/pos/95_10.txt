Yes, I have a copy of it uncut on VHS in excellent condition, which I have transferred to DVD. If anyone would like to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic, please email me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i and I thought that I can not be the only one on this planet who has this classic on tape, there must be other people, and if they do, I'll go with them because they are very few who have this classic. I have all the Muppets for Christmas except one that John Denver did with the Muppets again. I think it's a smoky mountain vacation. I'm not sure, but it's close.
