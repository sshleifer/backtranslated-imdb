I think this movie is very pleasant. The plot is simple and easy to digest, the humor is light and clean, and since the plot, which involves false identity, is quite common, I look forward to seeing how this film illustrates this story. It turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female lead is admirable; Her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to make David's crafty role a few white lies was very charming. I think Vera is also very, very well done. I feel drawn to her toes as she fiddles around the stage effortlessly and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who are fed up with today's profanity-filled films, you'll love this movie.
