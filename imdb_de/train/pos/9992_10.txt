... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes nobody should miss. Nice story, funny situations between riches and rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad track, maybe not perfect, but he's funny; D Do not look at the rating, but at BS. Look at it, then look at something like Final Destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If so, I do not think we can be friends. XD At this point I recommend every Brooks fan the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm";) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of Inchworms! I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment. I do not want to write a book here: P
