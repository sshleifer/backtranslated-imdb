Omigosh, this is really the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement, and I've seen heaps (given the limited availability in New Zealand that's a lot), but never before had I had to sleep with the light until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this is a rip-off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (but different) storylines, but the Grudge considers itself a frightening movie - seen in the movies , I even cried at a certain point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, especially by the minor characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a true hottie and William Mapother seems to be having fun. Although I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she does not really seem to dive into this movie. Of the minor characters, hers probably had the deepest and the darkest story, but she does not seem to be everything. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she's about the same in all her movies and roles, right? The ghosts were really scary, the music and sound effects were daunting (especially the noise made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the end was cool too. <br /> <br /> 9/10
