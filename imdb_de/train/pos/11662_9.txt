The secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and stunning animated films I have ever seen. Before I looked at this film, I was convinced that nothing could give up for his money and that winning in this category was a huge success, but I found Kells to be a serious contender. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a bit too strict and much more intent on fortifying the wall around the city from an imminent Viking attack than promoting the boy's imagination. When legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) shows up and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey into the forest and meets a beautiful forest nymph named Aisling who likes him (and saves his life more than once ). With Aisling's help, he seeks to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book that legend says can turn darkness into light. <br /> <br /> View my full review of The Secret of Kells: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
