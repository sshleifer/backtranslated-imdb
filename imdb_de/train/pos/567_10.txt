Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann have teamed up to make some of the best westerns ever made, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the movie, however, are the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serve as a backdrop for the US history. Some of the best films ever made in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> In all five westerns where Stewart and Mann were playing together, the supporting roles were perfectly staffed. No exception here, except for parts that can only consist of a few lines. The characters are firmly marked with these lines. Stewart is a cynical, hard-nosed loner in this movie whose only true friend is his pal friend Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death by the villains, who wants to get him to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and thereby to solve themselves by chance. John McIntire is the main villain of the play and he was a subconscious actor with a long reach. He could play adorable old codgers, authority figures, and in this case a particularly evil and cunning villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best western ever.
