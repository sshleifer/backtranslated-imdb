But the opposite, sorry bud, I completely understand how to get into a movie because you're referring to the subject (and you have). This movie is awesome, the main character would give every Charlie Brown subtitle a fight for his money. He just keeps muttering, which is always a laugh. Most scenes feel awkward when characters often look at one another. If your line is now, then I will respond. Best British comedy? Please buddy, talk to your bad self a strong word ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this movie is awful. I mean, the people involved are into it ... they made a movie ... and maybe motorcycle enthusiasts are interested in it, but people who still live here with a sense of humor on earth will smile more than just a Christmas present they did not buy them ... was that too hard? I apologize...
