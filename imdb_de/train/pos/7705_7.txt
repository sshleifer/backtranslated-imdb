I've seen this about 10 times now, so there has to be something I like! <br /> <br /> The 1950s US science-fiction movies were pretty mixed: they were either smart and / or thought-provoking or cheap and ridiculous cheeses. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in this rarity for the genre color. <br /> <br /> It also had a head start with the script - though Shakespeare may not have realized it, it was based on its timeless playing and thus guaranteed a certain longevity if done well. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a murderous idiot who was artificially infinitely magnified by machines used 200,000 years before a dead race. Along the way, the storyline expands on 50s stereotypes and so pure corn that you sometimes wonder why you see them, but they always do. This love triangle thing ... yuk! Disney's cartoon series is still going well, and the comic backgrounds directly from the cover of the Galaxy magazine etc. look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car in the distance across the desert is a shout! All in all, with all the mistakes, the best of its kind, and we should be grateful that such flawless printing survives.
