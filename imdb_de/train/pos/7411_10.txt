The key to joy and beauty, to the pain and sadness of life is our ability to basically accept life as being what it is. That's why we do not constantly fight against this compelling truth. This way we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so hard for most of us to grasp. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth, but lets it discover in our own way. This is a nice but simple story, more of a fable played very well. Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than watching actors. <br /> <br /> I had trouble writing a review of this beautiful movie so others would be motivated to see it. I am at a loss. The story is about men in a bathhouse. Sounds like a real turn, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shower, but that is almost a contrast to an important thematic element in this movie, the bathroom. I am still at a loss. If you talk about the story or the characters, that does not do it justice. <br /> <br /> I just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was. I was also pretty entertained. I took great care of the characters and took care of what happened to them. For every story, this is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you've been moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, you should see The Shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality is excellent. I've seen it in the original lanquage with well-made and well-placed English submarines. <br /> <br />
