Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield), until both fall in love with her neighbor, Court (Jason London). But not after a terrible tragedy, the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them from each other and that their love for one another will never fade. Probably the most painful story of young love I've ever seen. Acting is fantastic and Reese Witherspoon delivers a great performance in her first movie. I would give the man in the moon 8.5 / 10
