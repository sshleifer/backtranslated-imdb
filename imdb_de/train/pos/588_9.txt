I have seen all the films shot by Robert Redford, and I appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In A River Runs Through It, Redford shows the lyrical romance and visual splendor of the Montana's high Rocky Mountains as if he were a 19th-century landscape painter by Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film loves the visual and the word with texts by author Norman Maclean and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose parenting methods include fly fishing, as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt include growing teenage sons and later complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are absolutely believable, like the brothers, whose love for fly fishing will forever connect them to each other. It's the relationships between men, fathers and sons, brothers and their wives to the outside world that explain A River Runs Throughs to a tale of stories missing in so many Hollywood films in recent years. <br /> <br /> However, what makes these relationships special is the attention that Redford gives to the language spoken in dialogue. This is a written script, nice to listen to and memorable when connected to the stunning rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and setting correspond to the performances of a cast rising to its material. The idea of ​​fly fishing may be a strange way to center a story, but it's not that implausible in Redford's hands. Considering the material, Redford's Sode is an easier time and worth a visit.
