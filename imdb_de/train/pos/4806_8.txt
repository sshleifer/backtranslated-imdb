A new page in the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most of the fleeting thoughts of Queen Victoria are those of a woman who ruled for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives the audience a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, the rise to the throne, and the early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the movie. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors, including Miranda Richardson, are a good choice. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a dramatic story and histrionic "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth seeing. There are a few historical freedoms that scriptwriting took over. The film seeks to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the time. The stage design and the costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film is especially appreciated by those who are interested in the story, time drama and Blunt and the other actors. Recommended by heart. <br /> <br /> Note: A
