This movie seems to get some bad reviews for some reason. Probably only from the mass population. Anyway, that's actually a very interesting movie. The film is a sci-fi movie with too little budget that actually works because of an interesting story and well-made scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If sci-fi fans read this, I definitely recommend this movie if you like good old sci-fi movies. The movie has crazy ideas. The scene includes nations that go to war with GIGANTIC machines, where all the countries invest all their money! The world was divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war, or rather to a "robot duel". The method of warfare is cleaner than the nuclear war, since now all of them carry respiratory masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well written and good effects for the economical budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have a small budget and actually work.
