When a small town is threatened by a child murderer, a police officer follows him by pretending to be his girlfriend. As she becomes more and more emotionally concerned with the killer, her psyche begins to beat, resulting in her no longer focusing on working with the criminal. Not a movie of high voltage excitement, but solid police work and a good account of the flawed mind of a psychotic loser.
