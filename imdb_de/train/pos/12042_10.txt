........... as I've seen this movie) I'll never watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason is that we had read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class got into trouble when the woman in black came through the window and hovered over Kidd's bed, although this was just a short while ago when there was something that also scared us when Kidd found the toy soldier under his pillow and a child's voice says, "It's for you." This scene still haunts me, almost 7 years after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
