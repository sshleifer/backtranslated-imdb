The men can slaver over Lollo if they want (or their Lollos - she gave her a name for the breasts in French), but the ladies have an even tastier bite in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful in acting. Do not be put off unless your version contains subtitles, because in this simple, brisk story of love and war, where everything is fair, they are not needed. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads the palm of Philipe and tells him that he will marry the princess. After that, the story of the Gallic gestures and running, jumping and swordplay is pretty clear. <br /> <br /> On the minus side, the obviousness of the story and the cumbersome facets of the sound become a bit tiring. and it is annoying that the French apparently consider themselves superior to Hollywood in order to even plausibility of their exciting stunts. And of course the non-French speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la like: Virtuoso girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, why did you think I was interested in this bagatelle?
