There are moments in the movie that are so terrible that your teeth hurt. But knowing that there were only a few weeks left before the code made movies harmless and bland, Paramount rushed it into production before allusions and denials went out of fashion. Vanities is so cruel to women that it is delicious. While Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown with price tags that would insult a Bronx hooker. They emerge from mussels (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in absolutely absolute postures. Minions of the law, so stupid that they can not find the door, their skirts can look up and giggle. Bare-breasted choral girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (could they possibly be a source of hallucinogens?), While we hear "Sweet Marijuana" and watch blood fall to the chest of a chorus. Carl Brisson has learned his lines phonetically and does not seem to know what he's saying. But it's worth it when Norma steals the show while nobody is looking. <br /> <br /> If you take a moment of this fragile lint seriously, the point of the entire exercise misses. Take a look at this with a founding member of NOW and get ready to justify the whole Hollywood machismo between body thrusts. <br /> <br /> By the way, Toby Wing is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> A walk through the Memory Lane.
