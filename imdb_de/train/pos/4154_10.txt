This was one of the best episodes of all time. The officer Sean Cooper was murdered in 1968 in his patrol car. A dying convict in the state prison shows that he stole a heroin block from the car after shooting. His case is resumed on the assumption that he was corrupted as a police officer. Further investigation into him as a police officer and a person reveal that a war veteran is involved in a forbidden love. This kind of love was considered shameful and at least hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love I personally support, he was still a cop and a human and should not. It was not killed for it. The soundtrack was excellent (keeping me constantly on the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to highlight an object or give a scene a particular feel was particularly appealing. I will repeat this here!
