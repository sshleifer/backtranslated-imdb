My friends and I have just discussed how frustrated we are with the way films and especially romantic comedies are made. We are offended by the blow Hollywood is inflicting these days as they behave as if everything is alright. It does not have the big names of the actors, the big budget, I do not think there was a big release (I rented it from Hollywood Video). <br /> But it had what most people lack. It was a great chemistry between the love interests "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Your love story was not forced upon us like so many. The director took the time to really get to know these characters. Her story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The side cast added not only really funny comic moments to the story, but also depth. James LeGros's character was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in a psychic hotline was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great it is to fall in love.
