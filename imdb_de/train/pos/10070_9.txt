When I saw this movie on video last night, I constantly got these tingles that told me this movie will last. I have the feeling that I will look at it over and over again. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities one can expect in a story / movie. And although some cultural references are dark to me, a Western viewer, this is essentially a universal story.
