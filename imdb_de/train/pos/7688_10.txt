Back in 74 Eric Monte made the classic TV show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love seeing the Reruns on TV land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther's role. John Amos was feeling a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity most of the time, giving millions of fans time to see the Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ had not been there with his always Kool Aid attitude to save her. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 should have been longer than in the 80s, when I grew up.
