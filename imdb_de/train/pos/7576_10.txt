The third and last part of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of them all. The "training" is even completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone. This film details how Hanzo investigates the loan sharks performed by blind monks. There is also a historical commentary on the proud refusal of ancient Japan to integrate Western technology. While the first Hanzo movie was just a funny and bloody ride with little connection to his storyline, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got Gold" does it all together and brings everything home in the end. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (it's * Hanzo, the razor, after all).
