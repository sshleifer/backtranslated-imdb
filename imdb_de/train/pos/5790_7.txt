Impressive! I can only say that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian) then I'm just giving up. In her short skirt, high boots and pronounced chest line she is a real baby, even if her zombie-like eyeshadow comes and goes. These 30 minutes are undoubtedly the sexiest of the series. Watch the realistic and insightful wrestling match with Bronson until he bangs her chin unaffected and ruined all the fun. Okay, I probably should give up my hormonal reaction. <br /> <br /> This is a very good half hour of this undervalued force behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Of course, the producers want to complete the third season with an above-average entry. It's an America after the nuclear war (we know it's part of the invasion power), and only Americans Bronson and Soviet Montgomery are left, along with about twenty tons of realistic rubble. They wander between destructions in changing moods, wondering how long it takes for biology to trump politics, which of course is the case (happy Bronson). And that's it. No real talk, except what Bronson has to say, which is pretty over the top. Still, the script is still entertaining and daring for its time, suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truckers (a popular stereotype of the Cold War of the time). <br /> <br /> It's pretty curious that the very Slavic-looking Bronson (Buchinsky) would be cast as an American and the shiny-looking Montgomery as Slavic. In terms of appearance, it should be the other way around. My guess is that the producers did not want to engage the American in the physically weaker role of the woman, regardless of appearance. However, there is little of the usual TZ anxiety or atmosphere, yet the episode remains a very, very observable 30 minutes.
