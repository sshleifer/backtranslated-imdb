PRC, the lowest, actually hit gold with this capricious little thriller. With "Detour", one of the best low-budget movies ever made, they did the same. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a one-set movie filled with fog and shadow. a technique used by most Poverty Bureaus to hide the sets or their absence. But it works well here. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) staggers in the swamp, killing those involved in his unlawful execution for murder, and bringing sympathy to the viewer. His last victim is to be the ferryman's daughter ... he concentrates his anger not only on those directly involved in his fate, but also on his relatives. Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that suits her acting style. She offers herself to the strangler to stop the killing, but as jokes to the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete, and he returns somewhat discouraged to the afterlife. If Ulmer (who directed "Detour") ran "Strangler", she would hang on the next tree and the work of the Strangler would be done. But who complains? It is not the story that is the main attraction, but the veiled sets, the lighting and the general moodiness of the play. Immediately behind "Detour" stands PRC's most beautiful hour
