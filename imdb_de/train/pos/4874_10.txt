Kusturika has made it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of own landmarks, with frenetic rhythm and many wonderful moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! The music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and amazing devices and inventions, all colorfully visual, just to entertain. Pure cinema in essence. A wonderful experience. And one is especially grateful, as good comedies are so rare and wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you've enjoyed Kusturica's earlier films, you'll love that, though, as in all comedies, it's a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it.
