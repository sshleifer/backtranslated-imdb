This is essentially a variation of House Of Wax, both in the storyline and in the role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both images, he plays a talented artist driven mad by his creations, usurped by other less gifted and less scrupulous people. In this film, he plays illusions for stage magicians who want to build themselves a career just to be frustrated when another illusionist, the Great Rinaldo (John Emery), insists he keeps his contract and gives him the first choice of gives him illusions. The price is already bad for Rinaldi, as his former wife is now a supremacy of Rinaldi. He uses his talent as an illusionist and a brilliant facial expression to avenge on Rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much the whole show here and there is a well-understood star turn is a bad luck man, whose predicament brings sympathy to the audience. The rest of the cast is competent when it is colorless and the weight of the whole car falls on Price, which carries the load with ease. <br /> <br /> Good solid B-movie melodrama. This is a crime movie and not a horror movie. It is pleasant, provided you do not expect a masterpiece. In black and white it is little gore and is best seen as a melodrama and for its presence enjoyed stars give an idiosyncratic performance
