Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept in this kind of role, where he has to portray a character whose morality is initially uncertain for the audience. As so often with Sutherland's characters, we must ask, "Is he a Villian or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story told intelligently. about the incompetence and anxious bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union, which hindered the efforts of extremely competent people. Sutherland's character is ironic: "The measure of a bureaucracy is its ability to make no special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between Rea and Sutherland's characters), after the perestroika was forced with their revelations, has tremendous emotional implications. You can feel the suffering of the committed people who have worked in this system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes depicting the victims' family members add emotional resonance to the story's impact. This is rarely a feature of a movie with this disgusting theme, but effectively reminiscent of the victims' lives and loved ones. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important movie that has earned its showcase on Canada's History Television.
