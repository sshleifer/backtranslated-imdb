Sweet idea ... The saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a tiny little community from Lampidorra. This country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course there were only 48 states at that time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the land she inherited and we follow her as she tries to figure out what to do with this foreign land and its even stranger people. Once she sings a song she claims is from her people, the Navajo, and from there it gets darker and darker ... though Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and ubiquitous smile are never ruffled or torn to pieces. There are other songs scattered everywhere as the citizens sing to greet their new princess. In a glorious British version of Technicolor or a similar result over the only big name here, Dirk Bogarde is filmed as a British subtitle Tony Craig, cheese seller. Bogarde made a big appearance in the British film industry after his military service and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and "the new princess" cling to each other again and again, and their adventures are becoming ever closer together as the financial problems of Lampidorra worsen ... A little farce ... in the spirit of Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the author and director of our small project, and was married for 50 years! Guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi films in both the UK and the US.
