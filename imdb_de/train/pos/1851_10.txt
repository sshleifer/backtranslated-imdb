I saw this movie in August at the 27th annual conference of the National Union of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI. It is the first public screening. THE MOVIE IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher wrote the film very well and Denzel's direction is right on the money. Opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
