Sure, this movie was not like that. 16 blocks, inside a man, an American spook. etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a big puzzle that can happen to any of us. I found this movie really great and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed this movie "San Pedro, California" And we've heard true stories about incidents in this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you heard about the famous boat on the long beach "Queen Mary". Well, this boat is being tracked. i believe in spirts, illusions and parallel or whatever you spell. is real. Everyone is in their own universe. <br /> <br /> and the mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend to watch this movie. It's great and not bad directed. <br /> <br /> for those who rate it as 1st. They do not understand the movie. it means. his plot, his view. and how bad ocean life can be for each of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
