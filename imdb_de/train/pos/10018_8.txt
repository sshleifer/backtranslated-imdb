This night listener is better than people say. It has weaknesses and seems to have a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think that its creepy atmosphere and its fascinating performances make up for it. The whole thing feels like one of those fireplaces "that happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. A big complaint about the movie is the tempo: But the slow and sometimes awkward pace is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this film is well kept in the realm of possibilities, and real life is just a jerk. So there are no obvious endings or groundbreaking revelations, no "showdown" scenes. Thank goodness You must enter the zone if you watch this movie, forget about your reservations and expectations for the (conventional) good movie. Williams is not great, but he easily fulfills the needs of the story, and his character should be somewhat generic ("No One") because he is the Everyman, the avatar through whom we enter the story ourselves. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (though perhaps she should not win it). Try it once. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is certainly one of the twenty percent of all films that hit the market these days.
