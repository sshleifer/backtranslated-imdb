Mark Frechette plays the radical left of the college Mark. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a riot on campus and flees all the way to the desert. He steals a small plane at the local airport and flies it himself. <br /> <br /> As soon as you leave the desert, Mark discovers a car from the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark circling the plane. Mark plunges the plane several times very deep, causing Daria to duck or get hit. When he lands, he meets Daria, who is fascinated by Mark's airy high jinks. <br /> <br /> After plunging into soulful conversations for hours, Mark and Daria undress and love each other in the sand. But as Mark eludes the law, they realize he has to keep going. Marks and Darias short Tryst is very moving, because he can not develop into a full-fledged romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the beginning of the 70s. Both movies have a sprawling, vague quality with intricate meanings and characters. Frechette was as reckless as his character in this film. A few years after he made Zabriski Point, Frechette deprived a bank of real life. During his term, Mark died a baseless death. He was killed by a weight of 150 pounds, which fell on him during weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best part about this movie was the great cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible slow motion scenes of debris hovering in the air after a blast were a stroke of genius. Although Zabriski Point was not as groundbreaking as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonated with the counterculture of the early 1970s. I recommend it for those who like avant-garde films that show the uproar of youth uprisings in the early 70s.
