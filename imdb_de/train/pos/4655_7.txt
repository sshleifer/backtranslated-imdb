Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler, who is just getting out of prison at the beginning of the film. As soon as he leaves the gates, he immediately works on a plan to re-create a bundle of theft, though this time he has a pretty big goal. This is actually one of the weak points of the film, as it apparently does not know about computers (few did in 1968), but it literally manages to become a computer genius overnight! Yes exactly. Anyway, he has the idea of ​​spending a computer expert and getting a job with a large American corporation so that he can embezzle a ton of money. Considering that his knowledge of computers is only rudimentary, it is amazing how he realizes a brilliant plan AND manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defense. But it's a movie after all, so I was able to expose the unbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can run away with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, it becomes very, very confusing and Smith announces that she has actually managed to accumulate more than two million by investing in the companies founded by Ustinov (although she did not know that they are only dummy companies). This should mean that these stocks were ultimately worthless. What they seem to imply (and I might misconceive here) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stock before it became public and the stock became worthless. In any case, the movie seems to have a magical ending, where nobody gets hurt and everyone is happy - and that just did not make sense. It's really a shame, because the acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I seemed to have interpreted the end, let me know because the movie was very vague in the end.
