I disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding Jim Belushi's talent. I really like Belushi. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he appeared in the scene for the first time because I was a huge fan of his deceased brother John. But Jim has a charm on screen that has taken him a long way - and he has developed it well over the years. Curly Sue is one of his earlier films - his weight is a giveaway (is not that true of most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it is touching and heartwarming. So if you have chases, explosions, and unnecessary sex, you may want to pass it on - it's a warm movie of three lost soles finding each other. Do not get me wrong, I'm all in favor of the three aforementioned keys to a successful movie, but I also like a nice, solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch perform well, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents?)?) should be shot. You would not want a better introduction to fame than this movie, and nothing special has been heard of her since. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
