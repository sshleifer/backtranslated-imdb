Nowadays Spielberg's "The Color Purple" has been nominated for eleven Oscars and won Zilch. Even more disturbing is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserved more recognition than they were granted. <br /> <br /> The story refers to the trials and afflictions of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman who is initially dominated by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's narrated from a decidedly feminine perspective, but you do not have to worry about it being a sugar addicted "chick movie". <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes animated with humor, although the main character's struggles take precedence. Some may not appreciate the change of sound towards the end of the movie, but I did not mind, though similar content in a smaller movie would probably make me roll my eyes. The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were well deserved and Danny Glover was inexplicably stiff. As already mentioned, Spielberg was not nominated for Best Director for his efforts. Such a failure embittered faith, since Spielberg's direction here is first-rate. I'm not crazy about Quincy Jones' score, but it's not below average. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is a satisfying story well told by a filmmaker working at Pulitzer Award Winning Material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be treated so badly on Oscar night.
