49. PAPERHOUSE (Thriller / Horror, 1988) Ill in bed with fever Eleven-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) only has her drawings to accompany her. Her health is gradually worsening as a series of mysterious "black outs" grab her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house on a barren field where only a sick, sick boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) lives. When a dark, unknown danger threatens its idyllic "paper house", Marc's life is endangered. Their lives are also in danger, as these dreams reflect their own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Haunting's first debut film by British director Bernard Rose. Created from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, she leaves behind many other "original" fantasy works. When a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it's difficult to give it the mix of fable and reality to make it work in movie form. Director Rose successfully captures the fantasy world aspect of children along with a darkness that she wants to grab. <br /> <br /> Phillip Glass's feverishly posed pose knows how to skillfully use music with a skilled timed "jump out of your seat". Moments Most thrillers are very sloppy in this all-important aspect because they make the audience unaware of what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he absorbs tension and never lets it fall into the next sequence of events. His mastery of the placement of objects within the frame (as in his paintings by P.O.V.hots) adds an extra dimension to cinematography that otherwise seems to be lacking. Only in Europe will you find such sinister places presented here: the lonely house, the fields, seaside towns, the watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this movie with "Candyman" (1992). Horror gem of a truly thinking person and a real cult horror favorite.
