This was one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was glad to see it on DVD, which is a relief when looking at the old, grainy VHS versions. I had not seen it in years and have seen it today, wondering how good that movie was on time. It's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy that combines great writing (really funny line with really funny line) with great direction and outstanding performances. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (though John Gielgud won as Best Supporting Actor). If Moore's appearance in "Arthur" does not win a Best Actor Oscar, that's proof that no comedian actor ever won the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). Steve Gordon. <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon makes the movie beautiful, staying true to each of the characters and the warm tone of the story. IMHO, the movie is just a gem. It's just sad that Steve Gordon died just one year after the release of Arthur. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, which is available from 1/2007, it is. Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some extras that are nice, but not enough. An example is a commentary from the director in which he states that he desires to see how certain deleted takes and scenes could be recorded (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult decisions for a final edit. The DVD, which offers the perfect format for such material, should have certainly offered it. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy intended for books.
