Arthur is a rich middle-aged "child" who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes to mind. He likes to boast about his wealth and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur has to marry a high-class girl to inherit a fortune, but he falls in love with poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird). <br /> <br /> This is a damn funny movie. I saw this movie because a very famous Indian movie "Sharabee" is based on Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is definitely inspired by "Arthur," I think they are two different films. "Arthur" is just fun. It is sometimes very hackneyed. There are so many fantastic deposits in the movie. It's not fun, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©'s father and he keeps talking about the moose. Duddley Moore certainly has a weird timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene in which he talks to a sitting couple in the hotel about a "small" country and he talks in two different directions to a man and a woman. John Gielgud received an Oscar for this film. I do not know this actor. I do not think he did a great job, but if I look more at his work, maybe I agree. The film has some flat spots, but not very long. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
