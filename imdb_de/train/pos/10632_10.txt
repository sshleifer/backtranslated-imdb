This is a movie for entertainment; I do not think the world made social comments out of a small movie. Personally, I find this movie funny, bold and memorable. It's a fantasy that resembles an ashen girl who becomes a princess. This movie was very well done, I would like to add, in the 70s a time of the best experiments in the film in which he could mention the sexuality of a person. This movie is not about whether a person is homosexual or not, but it is about love in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the realities of being gay in Hollywood or California in the 70s. Pretty guys who are cared for by older, not so pretty men. Women who had to stay locked up in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community. Then the imagination begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some alcohol, and what do we have? Well, this movie was in some ways better than the bleak repeating of "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the entire crew to watch this movie, and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie when I saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips. I recommend to anyone who wants a fun, tender movie to curl up with popcorn and have fun. Some people need to brighten !!! And this is the movie you are with! should do <br /> <br />
