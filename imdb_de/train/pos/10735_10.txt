When the first time appeared 6 months after the tragedy, I did not want to see it. I did not want to open old wounds. I have regretted it. Now I have seen the movie. Thank god I did. It shows you the courage of all FDNY and NYPD. I greet you. It offered me the closure. I can go on with my life now.
