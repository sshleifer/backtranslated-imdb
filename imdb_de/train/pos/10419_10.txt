I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanzas was the best voice God could offer if he'd had the nerve to leave Hollywood and go to the opera he could have been, the American Caruso, anyone who claims to have it It is a fantastic introduction to the art form, there are no bones and if so, it will be so. In the movie you can see why Mr. Lanza is also discussed in my house. Someone says Pavarotti, I say MARIO LANZA. As far as the movie itself is concerned, when will it be released on DVD, it has to be restored and VHS is not good enough, but this should be the only Lanza movie to be dubbed on DVD.
