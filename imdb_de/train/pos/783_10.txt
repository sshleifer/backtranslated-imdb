The first word that comes to my mind after seeing this movie is "beauty". Beauty is everywhere in the actor's game (Andie is outstanding, as always), in well-designed settings, and in the red line of authors - of love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in those three women's otherwise boring and predictable lives. His interaction makes Andie's character live as entertainingly as possible. When he left, it became obvious that we could not really appreciate and hold our inner faith and our holy desires. The fact that Andie successfully recovers from this loss is not bad, but shows that life dominates every form, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason why I love this movie is that it's so British in every way - all houses and "fags" and accents :))). And Andie is doing a great job again! It's a shame that this movie got such bad marks. 10 out of 10!
