Since I'm from Canada, I can not say if this movie is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately we do not see many Danish films here in a year! Nor can I comment on Clausen's acting in connection with his other roles - I personally found him credible - a touching monstrosity of a man, this Jorgen! As for the actor who played Kenneth, why exclude his participation in a television program as an actor? Are not we about such elitist attitudes? International viewers who do not know his participation in Big Brother will find him a fair actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the mistakes of the film (the writing could have been more subtle in some cases), I subscribe to what one might call the "message" of the film - the essential role of art in everyday life, art as a healing power. Art sanctifies the lie (art sanctifies the lie) - that is a sacred lie: the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense.
