I saw this movie a few times in the 90's and almost split my pages every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but getting up is something else. He is so funny. Even the P.C. Brigade would find that funny. It's a must, and even better if you have the boys or girls for a drink. The deduction of Michael Jackson is just like him, if you close your eyes, you think he sings him. The things he describes are lifelike and you would have to seriously avoid humor if you think that this is not funny. My local video stores are out of stock of this video, but I would like to get a copy to show my husband and my boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy it.
