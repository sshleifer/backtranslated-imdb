I've seen that this movie is a Jane Austen addict and always has doubts about the cinematic rendition of the complexity of their novels. Well, this implementation is just accurate, intelligent, tender, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word perfect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most beautiful and funniest novels thanks to generally ironic situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony and did not ignore the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What engages me in the novel, and the film makes it clear, is the English novelist's profound knowledge of human life and the modern look of women, men, and their relationship, and it's amazing to think how an eighteenth-century writer who lived almost a secluded life, who could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did: that which fascinates me most. We can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just replace the costumes and use a more current language, but the situations, the feelings and the ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives or the constant envy that now governs women's relationships as always, and still the difficulty of expressing feelings and feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universally time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: A young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited for this role (today she would probably be ready for it), Toni Colette is just great. And how I envied them the wonderful clothes they could wear! And then the breathtaking English landscape, where every situation gets a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really enjoyable and deserved movie.
