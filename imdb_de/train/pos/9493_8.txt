White fire has so much to offer. With Larry Bird, who looks like Robert Ginty burning away the load with his fabulous hair and his super macho mustache, the film rises above the other low-budget actioners. The charisma he has with him makes Tom Selleck look like a plaster. With Ginty beating everyone up, the movie only picks up when a story of diamond intrigues comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bush, chainsaw attacks and some great incest motifs. If you're looking for a fantastic B-action, then you've come to the right place. Well, if I can just get my hands on this soundtrack.
