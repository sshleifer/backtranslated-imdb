When I saw this movie in the fifties, I also wanted to become a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a friend with me to see it a second time. I do not think she was as impressed as me! This movie was funny and yet serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. The lessons from this film could be applied to questions related to today's GM experiments.
