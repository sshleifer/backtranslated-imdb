I found the film quite expressive, the way the main character was lost, but at the same time much clearer about certain things in life than the people who mocked him (such as his roommate). You loved seeing him tortured! it had this perverted side that was scary but we were all happy that he came out of misery again We love to watch him under sniper attack or fire, but in the end we are glad that he survives ... <br /> <br />.
