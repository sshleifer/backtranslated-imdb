When two more charming performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appeared together in a more charming movie in 1968, I do not know who they were. I first saw this adorable little satirical gem twenty-five years ago at the age of sixteen, and I consider every year that I did not sit down to see it as wasted. It's intelligent, quirky, neat, wistful, sweet, gently subversive and absolutely adorable. The romance of these two social misdeeds is both weird and terribly moving - more than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to get the right card into the deck, a scene that's both funny and a perfect miniature of heartbreaking loneliness. And this last statue on the worried, worried, loving face of Ustinov, when he asks: "Are you alright?" - Has anyone ever made the look and the sound of devotion so perfect and naked honest? I would never want to meet someone who did not love this movie.
