There are family problems in real life and that's what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through exams and exams, and that's what this film is all about. A man, Daddy, has the maturity and the strength to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The children are growing up, and the hard way is that it's getting harder and harder to realize that parents, no matter how old or parent they are, still love their children and are willing to give them a pillow when they fall. ALL actors portraying their characters performed well. Yes, I shed a tear on the way and knew that as a young adult and later as a parent, I had similar experiences. This is a lifelike thing that every young adult and his parents would see well, though some will not realize it until they are parents. A must for those who care about their families.
