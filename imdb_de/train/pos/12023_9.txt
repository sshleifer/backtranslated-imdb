In order to enjoy the prospect of modern British films, it is necessary to shift perspectives that somehow allow them to be seen for themselves and for their own qualities, rather than the criteria by which American films are judged. Britfilm must strive to be persistent and find it hard to make it, but British films can laugh with cordiality at their otherwise overwhelming rivals. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail in content, but only in itself for the predecessor, so that everything can be considered as the work of star and director somewhere at the end of their lines. It is a few decades later that Gregory is teaching and this time with two girls in her head. He teaches at his school railings against human rights violations. When he is feverish, he finds abuses in his midst and has to wonder if he's just talking. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive movie in which there is not the usual worldly character of an American movie that you expect him to do, he does, but a naive man boy who still has everything for Can question principles. Could be. It is certainly not a protest of numbers to be too warm. Where American films can appear realistic because they are urban and pithy, these and other British films of recent years - those that are not America's visceral thrills - are real because British humor reveals truths.
