... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I'm not enthusiastic about this short film. I happened to see it when I was at a Boston film festival, and I have thanked God every day since then. I truly believe that I was part of an event, such as reading a Tarantino script before anyone else, or the first showing of Mean Streets, or what the creative team has for future products, but I hope I can be there. <br /> <br /> Another really amazing movie.
