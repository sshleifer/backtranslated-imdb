I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this movie page because some of them were slightly misinformative. Originally, I posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was correct because this is the "comment" index and not a message board (although we used them before IMDb used the movie message boards added). I will work this out to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> First of all, you may not realize this, but Gene Kelly became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli opted for a Gershwin "Panorama" film, he wanted Kelly's character to be more demanding than the "Goody Two Shoes" roles he had played in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal "). , Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to construct a new Parisian story based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly the chance to play his famous role from Broadway, even though Warners had outbid MGM's rights to "Pal Joey". In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems have sunk the film (script changes and bad direction. ============================================================================= =============================== <br=> <br /> You complain that Kelly's Pictures They are not well done, even though you are leading your art education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed as bad art and is necessary for the story / characters Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even he knows, even though Milo has brought him close to the point where he almost believes her, but it's important that the audience is not sitting there saying: "But he's a great artist, if only he had the chance!" They want the audience to be fully aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then complain he sabotages his interest in the show; Again, you do not understand the structure of the story: he refuses, because he does not feel like a gigolo, and because he knows that he is not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as the enthusiasm of "Joey" to "found a nightclub". But it has the same function in action. Remember, in "Pal Joey" (the play), it's imperative that Joey give up his nightclub after realizing that he did not deserve it. The same applies to the art fair. If Kelly's pictures were really good, that would undermine this whole point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I think it's in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was good. Compare it to even worse "forced" romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion." ================================================== == <br /> <br /> If you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything in this movie, it just shows that you have not dug yourself into its imagery beneath the surface of the movie. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and the characters, and the dance dissolves the action through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love and then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed in such a way that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art as well as a separate phase of its relationship. If you have not seen that, it's not the film's fault. It's certainly not a "load of crap". ==================================================
