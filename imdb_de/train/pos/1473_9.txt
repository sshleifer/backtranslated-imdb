Keep in mind that any movie (let alone a documentary) that claims any kind of truth will produce a detrimental and proportionate amount of cynicism, of which those who are already on the trail of suggestions or truths that are already meaningless to you Masters of psychology, film and captains of the soul will undoubtedly find this film obsolete, after all, you already know everything that needs to be known. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us who were in the minority like myself, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" ... mostly brilliant and for anyone interested in movies, psychology and modern philosophy <br /> <br /> Slightly like Scott Mcloud's "Understanding Comics", director Sophie Fiennes, Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek directly integrates into many of the films and the scenes he has discussed. The cover is a picture of "The Birds" (Zizek takes out a boat to recreate the shot). Lacanian psychoanalysis, does not necessarily cry, an evening of fun ... but it is! If you like movies, then that's ... Some knowledge of Lacanian psychoanalysis (Symbolic, Real, and Imaginary) are terms that are a bit loosely thrown around at first, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes are remarkably clear to me was a very abstract topic. In fact, it's probably better to be familiar with the films he's discussing than the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Why I love, this movie does not pick great movies to analyze or reveal great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and clever way where film and psychology (and by default the philosophy). <br /> <br /> Why is "The Sound Of Music" somehow fascist, why is "Short Cuts" more than just class and estrangement, why are birds attacking in "The Birds", what's up Learning about the spirit through "Alien Resurrection", what does the planet Solaris do, what do "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" have in common, and what the hell is David Lynch coming across from film to film. .. well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in both "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith" is perhaps the film's strongest and clearest moment when it comes to female sexuality Subjectivity I'm Wondering ... at some point, Zizek admits that he feels that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta, that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (jokingly, it seems ...). Anyway, it's a fascinating documentary that anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant more than literally said should try it. <br /> <br /> And anyone who cares Slavoj Zizek, this is also a must, a lot less dry than "Reality Of The Virtual" and more direct than "Zizek!", Two other pseudo-documents about "Elvis's contemporary Cultural Criticism ", as it is dubbed, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide To Cinema" is NOT about the role of sex in the cinema. Zizek claims that cinema is the ultimate perverted art because it teaches "how you wish and not what you want", and that it is the only contemporary art form that allows you to articulate those desires. This is not a film about finding reality in the cinema, it's about finding cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find and a bit long, but worth the effort, one of the most "stimulating" movies I have ever seen.
