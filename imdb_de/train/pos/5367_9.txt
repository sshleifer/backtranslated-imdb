This film is one of the most underrated films of its time. If you see this movie, full of action, and if something is not going well, the humor is second to none. Brilliant writing for a movie that has become a bloody mix, a gameshow where criminals are the candidates, and a near future where everyone is thirsting for blood. I do not want to ruin anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives "I will come back". He gets the best answer from everyone in this movie. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I do.
