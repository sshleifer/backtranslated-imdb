I saw the movie for the first time when it landed on US cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head off, I was only 16 years old and it was the first New Wave music I heard since I was a strictly folky, classic boy. The music fascinated me, as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels' tough but gentle cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's saxophonist. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic that he only asked for pity. Favorite scenes, the performance as the lights go out, and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the movie is not the rose! But it was really outstanding for his limited budget and for his portrayal of Britain in the early '80s, exploding with rebellious youth and looking for a way out of the queue. I was in the UK just a few years later and found that the film was very reflective of the atmosphere I found there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see it. It's a great movie with wonderful performances, and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
