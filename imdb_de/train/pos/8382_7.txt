If you like Mech War games, it's pretty good. Some of it is cheap, but the robot fight is worth seeing. I've been enjoying the Mech Warfare for some time now, and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that feels close to what it would be like to control one of those giant 'Mechs. If you like the genres, then games that you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to save the Steel Battalion. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There really has to be more films on the same topic. Less remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it
