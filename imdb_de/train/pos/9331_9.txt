This movie was last week and although the quality of the movies at this time of day (around 6pm) is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. She does not look very nice at first, but when you see the whole movie, you want her to succeed. This movie really makes you think. And I think that's essentially because of Brooke Johnson's great acting. I'd never heard of her or knowingly seen her in another movie, but that was a great show. Compliments to Brooke. I hope to see you soon in another movie.
