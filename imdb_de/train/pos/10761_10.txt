My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to see her. She comes from China and has only heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold, hard truth. She wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. I felt terrible watching this documentary, it was like experiencing the nightmare again and it still brings tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I am very grateful to have seen this documentation, I am sure we all remember where we were and what we did when we heard. All of us could only ask specific questions: "Why?", "How?", "What's up?", "Oh, my God!" Almost all Americans were grateful for the brave firefighters and police who risked their lives save others. But I do not think we thought about what they really wanted. It was not supposed to be a documentary about September 11th, the cameraman was only filming a typical day, and they were only a few blocks from the World Trade Centers and had everything inside and out. <br /> <br /> On September 11, I thought to myself, "It's OK, the cops and firefighters are going to bring the survivors out." To be honest, I thought it was an accident. I was in the high school class and was changed from the gym and prepared to attend my science class. Someone came into the locker room and shouted, "In New York, a building has just been bombed!" We all hugged and ran into our classrooms while watching the first tower burn on TV. Not just 15 seconds later, the second plane crashed live on TV into the other World Trade Center and we knew it was no coincidence. A few minutes later, we learned from the Pentagon and that a plane flew to Chicago but was shot down. So many thoughts went through our minds and I kept thinking, "What are the firemen and policemen doing?" But it's a procedure for them, I thought, they'll know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives are gone now, the second tower crashed, things would never be the same. These firefighters in this documentary showed courage, confusion and strength, the real human emotions. They did not know what to do, they were as scarred as those people who were in the towers. They heard the bodies collapse on the floor as people jumped out of the windows. And here I was in a classroom crying when I saw what was going on on TV. I was amazed at this movie and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all Americans were for their help. I know they feel like they're just doing their jobs, but they did more, they were heroes. Every day after 9/11, they dug for three weeks, knowing that there were no survivors, but they hoped and kept praying. May God bless their kind and courageous hearts. <br /> <br /> As for my roommate, she cried and admitted that this was the first time she was crying in these attacks. She saw the truth about what had happened on this tragic day. She asked, "Why?" I did not know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be so evil. "That sounds like Clique, but it was a normal day for all," said one of the firefighters in the documentary. Nobody expected this to happen. Not so, these people in the World Trade Centers or in the Pentagon, or the hijacked planes, they just did their jobs, happened to be there, or were just there for a second. Not only were they murdered, they were slaughtered and these kidnappers did it with a song in their hearts. When all the people in the Middle East celebrate, why do they? They celebrated the death and loss of: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Thanks to the people who made this documentary. They are really thinking about firefighters, police and troops in Iraq, and you hope there are good people in this world. Thanks to all these people, you are our hero. <br /> <br /> 10/10
