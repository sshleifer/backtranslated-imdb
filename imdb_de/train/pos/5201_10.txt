The Human Tornado is a 70-year blaxploitation film starring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore in what is perhaps his loveliest role to date. The film tells the story of Dolemite, a bad ass standing on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and wife to Dolemites "Ladies") named Queen Bee. However, it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to train their bat, so that Dolemite takes matters into its own hands. Rudy Ray Moore shows many different talents in this groundbreaking film, including strong dramatic skills, a mastery of kungfu, an impressive singing voice (he delivers two of the songs on the soundtrack), a touching, compassionate side with the ladies, and an overall captivating one Charisma and a strong sense of comic timing. This movie has everything, people: a deep conspiracy, a blase action, a weird comedy, beautiful women in need, a slam-bang ending ... what more can you ask for a movie?
