This is a delightful movie so exaggerated that my wife, daughter and I found him irresistible. The plot is just crazy, but "sounds" to the world of soap operas in all their unimaginable improbabilities and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I can not play anyone better than Kline, DICKheaded. Field's true desperate need for attention and confirmation-and her near-bipolar mood swings-played well against Field's famous (notorious?) Oscar exclamation. People who can provide such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie where I did not feel impatient with the Whoopi Goldberg characterization. I thought she was "just right" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also top notch. Just a great movie, if you are in the mood to take the ride and the LAUGH!
