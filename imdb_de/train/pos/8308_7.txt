It fits in with a musical Sunday to get your heart racing, and no one can do that better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers of the ladies and defined rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Contact Leon to provide a definitive characterization, as he did with David Ruffin at The Temptations and Jackie Wilson at Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This was a fascinating biography when we saw Little Richard fighting with his father, his church and with himself over who he was. He won the battle and nobody has his voice or style.
