I really liked this movie. I read some of the other comments, and although I feel sorry for those who did not understand it, I agree with some points of criticism. Which strangely makes me like this movie all the more. I accept that they have a nice cast to make a smart movie for the public, but it has so many levels and is still great to watch. I also love movies like these, which cause so many debates, theories, possible endings, and hidden subtext. Congratulations, Mr. Crowe, definitely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw it when it first came out while traveling in Mexico. It was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and have a great paranoia trip! Where does the dream end and does the real begin?
