When I saw this movie for the first time on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitude. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses prisoners for work. SÃ¶ll is what makes the move, his funny shaky movements give us insight into the way the South was back then. I believe that if Soll lives today, he will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude towards a small boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. While he has racist views, he trusts some of the convicts, who are all black. The two convicts he most trusted are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler, but in great performance as well as in hatred. <br /> <br /> This film should have become more well-known. It is, however, on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
