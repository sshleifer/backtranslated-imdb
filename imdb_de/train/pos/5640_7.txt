I really think that this movie is great personally. But in every movie there is a downer. Well, some of you might not have seen Hilary Duff's 'Raise Your Voice', but if you think about it, those two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In 'Brave New Girl', Holly wants it so hard to enter the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice' Terri wants to go to a conservatory in LA (do not remember the name of the local conservatory). They are both in the music field and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films are similar. Personally, I like 'Brave New Girl' better than 'Raise Your Voice'.
