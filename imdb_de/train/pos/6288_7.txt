GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, chic, stylish action image with high octane star power and lots of awesome-looking Cars . If you're into cars, this production by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") is worth seeing just to see the shiny vehicles. Although the film hides a stench of weakness in many areas, his precise sense of action and his excitement make him a moderately successful summer adventure trip. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as the young crook named Kip Raines, who does not provide a list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) at the beginning of the movie. When Kip's life is threatened by such threats, his older brother Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skilled car thief, is called upon to do a task in exchange for his brother's survival: Steel Fifty Cars, specified by model, color, year and make-in only four days. Memphis paid the first three days by recruiting a bandit band to help him finish the raid. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy, but rugged, retired carwalker who knows Memphis from previous stores, a colleague named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) as well Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> A subplot adds to the excitement and excitement of the movie with two police officers, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who, based on past experience, suspect that Memphis and His crew have nothing to do with anything and keep a special eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here. The audience gets to know these people through their rough lifestyle and takes on strong personalities through the hard core and the stylish atmosphere of the films. To make the movie even worse, the dialogue can not define the characters with a sombre cultural tone. I do not claim that I think that profanism and vulgarism are necessary for thrillers to flourish. I actually honor the director's decision to insist on extreme stupidity in a movie that could easily have earned an R rating. However, I believe in a movie like "In 60 Seconds" to strongly develop the enlightenment of the character. Dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are perfect because of the first-class performance, the actors are responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's slippery appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide convincing supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure with a satisfying first act, which explains the style of the story and the motives of the character. sets a fast action theme, but lacks depth and strong character use. In the second act, we encounter some more issues: history wastes time during much of this segment, and never really builds for the third act. While the middle of the film takes a lot of time and a sex scene offers a solid interlude, not much happens. The third act is pretty much a pure adrenaline rush with angry wall-to-wall thrills and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever made. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack to "Gone in 60 Seconds" is great for engaging in the inspirational action scenes. These are scenes like the chases where the movie works despite several destructive mistakes. Dominic Sena, whose career has mainly been commercial director, has an appealing style and attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds" that will provide the audience with two hours of excitement, thrills and excitement, but not much else. <br /> <br /> <br />
