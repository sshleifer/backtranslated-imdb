Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in the Ruins - the not-so-distant future is portrayed as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once you get the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a halt by "the Pulse", it offers a fun landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two main characters - Max (the Dark Angel / Bicycle Messenger) and - Logan (the rich rebel). It seems to be uneven, perhaps the result of a multitude of authors, but held together by the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who is both strong and unsteady, vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
