Dead To Rights is a police officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and accesses the man he believes killed him. Jack is later shot and framed for murdering the man he suspected of killing his father. <br /> Some months later, on the day Jack is executed, he escapes from prison and searches the city after the man who framed him for murder. Jack's quest leads him through a track of * bleep * that ends first. Everyone is dead. <br /> <br /> Throughout the game, Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to guide his dog Shadow to endless streams of people in 15 levels kill. The gameplay is basically "kill 30 people, find the switch to open the door.kill 50 people, find the switch to open the door" over and over again until the level is done. There are also fun mini-games like playing as a stripper to distract the bouncers in a nightclub so Jack can get to another area in the club. or bombing. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is also a tough game. You're taken to an area that is in a hustle and bustle of boys armed with sub machine guns while you have only one gun. The end of the game turns to dust and you have to rely on luck. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is as bloody as it is heavy. If you shoot a man in the face with a shotgun, blood will splash on the walls, ceiling, and floor. And since there are several men in each area, the walls are painted with blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
