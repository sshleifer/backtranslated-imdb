"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The show off <br /> <br /> the outstanding cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman shows an outstanding performance and is always exciting when he appears on the screen. Ethan Hawke is scene after scene, and Albert Finney just chews the screen. Marisa Tomei, however, is not used criminally, but looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is superb, the story is not linear, but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, though not known for his blockbuster, has proven to be a jewel with this!
