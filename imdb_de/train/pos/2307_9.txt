I have to say that this movie is really amazing and heartwarming. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not that bad either! It's so cute to see how Dani falls in love and it breaks my heart and at the same time warms my heart as I hear how Court falls in love with Maureen. but it is even sweeter to see how interested he is in Dani. I have to admit, although I wanted him to end up with Dani. It's just so cute to see her fall in love with her, I did not want her to break her heart so much. But the biggest tragedy I've ever seen happened in this movie. If I saw him die, I had to cry for a whole day. I just could not believe it. However, there has never been a more affectionate relationship in a movie than Maureen and Dani. You can really go through everything. I give this movie a 9 because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
