This was the most impressive, moving, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. To be honest, even these adjectives can not describe it. I can not just pick a scene that was outstanding for me. I think if I had to list a few, that would be the fireman's reactions to the collapsing sound of the leaping victims. the reaction of the people who were trapped in the elevator and who did not know what was going on when they finally showed up to the terrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; and finally the silence. <br /> <br /> On this day and now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a major disruption in power, as if millions of voices were suddenly startled and suddenly silenced - it's amazing how accurate it is in its description - there was really a disruption in power. <br /> <br /> This documentary clearly illustrates this disorder, the feelings are so unbelievably visual, the anger, the frustration, the shock, the fear, the exhaustion and the realization of its magnitude, it's all there, nothing is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and moving documentary that deserves and deserves Emmy, not just because it documents 9/11, but because it's just what it should be. <br <br /> If you're going to watch, be sure to bring a box of handkerchiefs with you, you'll need them, I know I did it.
