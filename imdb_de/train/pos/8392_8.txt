In this film, artful film techniques are shown, in which instead of the landscape shot, the camera's attention is small, as someone looks like, how the woman wears a cocktail hat and is wrapped in a cloth. How the husband can wear a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely relaxed and comfortable. How provocative the woman is is another feature of the tableau that the director decides to let us know that she is a sexually free spirit, and the goal is to receive the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with a special feeling for what the man feels. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open mind in which she holds nothing, is not particularly ashamed of how she behaved, and wants to share these facts with her, because her main focus is always on the fact of her marriage. Nothing and nobody can come between the two. Only the odds of fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war and the consequences of his return after his return. A very fascinating film that is totally absorbing.
