JUST CAUSE is a flawed, but decent movie held together by strong performances and creative (albeit highly predictable) writing. Sean Connery is a crusade against the death penalty that was used to rescue a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate punishment. To get things right, Connery ventures out to the scene, where he not only struggles with time, but also with a meddling sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). There are many twists and turns and role changes - some surprising, others not - as the aging Crusader tries to solve the puzzle. The climatic end is a bit ridiculous, but ONLY CAUSE is worth a glimpse of a slow night.
