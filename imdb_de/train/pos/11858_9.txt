This movie is just great. If you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. Although the film has almost nothing to do with his original from 1932, Pacino as Tony Montana does a great job getting around. Pacino has this path where he can say something anyway. Just make it sound great. If you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the dirty words (if you've seen it) then you should also see Scarface to see a different perspective as an actor can say. (it's pretty cute) <br /> <br /> Even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot goes very fast through time, the real-time aspect ratio does not stay correct, but it's still easy for you to follow You must always keep your eyes open so as not to lose anything. Personally, I've found that watching this movie sounds like a breeze for three hours, it's really just so great. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those movies that are played so well that they not only work well you forget that this movie was filmed in the crappy 80's, but that you really become evil ...
