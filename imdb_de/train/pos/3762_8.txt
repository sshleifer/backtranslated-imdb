Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return while the two buddies from San Dimas are sent on another journey of their lives, while someone from the future has the exact opposite of the feeling shown in the first film The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they have a chance to play a life after death so they can come back and stop two evil robots from ruining their future. In addition to the roles that they ... he ... perfected, they also play classic games (and have even revived a few extra sales) (I even have my original version of Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this movie better than the original is because it's about "how it could be" rather than "what was". Without spoiling the movie, I can not give you any further information (I think you both have to look at it and decide for yourself!) 8 out of 10 stars.
