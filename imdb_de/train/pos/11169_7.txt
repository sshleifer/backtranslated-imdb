When I first saw the movie, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the scary things happened, like when the church dies and comes back to life and Gage and his mother die and there's a jerk. Father has to bring her back to life, though he nods the warnings and ignores Jud. This is not the best work of Steven Kings. I thought his best work was the glow. I do not think the people watching and commenting on this movie are so terribly wrong, because all they think is what they thought. as if that person can do a better job in making a horror movie. I mean, making the meter evil and how it kills Jud is awesome. Making the most innocent and unsuspecting character one of the killers is cool. People who do not like the movie are stupid because it's all a scary movie and nothing. Do not expect something from a movie that it is not. It was still not so good. I still recommend people to watch the movie
