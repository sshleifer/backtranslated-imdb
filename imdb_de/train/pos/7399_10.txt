My choice for the best movie ever played was Laughton's "Night of the Hunter," which remains outstanding in my canon. However, it could have been replaced by "Shower," the most artistically dazzling film I've ever seen. The way one looks after others is represented by the flow of water, and the way that water can be made for inspiration and comfort, cleansing, etc. is the essence of the Dao. It can be argued that the themes of NOFTH and Shower are similar, and that Lillian Gish is the purest form of Christianity in the first form, since bathhouse operators are the purest form of Daoism. I would not oppose such an interpretation in any way. Both films are a visual delight in the integration of idea and image. Shower, however, offers such an un-stylized view of the sanctity of everyday life that I give it a nod. I adore both.
