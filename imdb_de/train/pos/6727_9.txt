I realized a few days ago that the creators of this film had a pun on the title. This film is not primarily about the act of the "giant giants," but mainly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING GIANT, to change the emphasis from the Wedge, one of the hardest and best bodysurfing spots of the world. I've been surfing 15 to 18 feet and ridden a lot and was hammered by 10- and 12-foot waves. This experience is the reason why I totally impressed the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, like any other normal mortal, could drive over a decade with Mavericks BY HIMSELF, is beyond my reach. The first safety rule of a water sports is "Never surf alone / dive / swim". He went to where healthy people would not and told them about it. I would not go out there if the water was 75 degrees and all the sharks were left. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: The first shot of the waves on Jaws keeps the skin tingling all over my body. These are not just scary waves, but uncontrolled intestinal evacuation waves. If we see that Laird Hamilton not only survives waves of 40 to 60 feet (I can barely enter those numbers), but faces actually work like a fun day at Rincon, I'm overwhelmed. Big Wave riders have a commitment and a focus that is comparable to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave him a 9 instead of a 10 because it's negligible to mention that there are big big wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at the outer log cabins and a 10 is it!
