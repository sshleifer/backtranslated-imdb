"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné film from the period 1936 to 1946, in which dialogues were written not by Jacques Prévert but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in the pair Jouvet / Arletty than the lovers Annabella / Aumont. The latter is rather bland, and their story is strangely reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except that the story of the Chanteuse is a tragic story. What fascinates today is this popular little world, the Canal Saint-Martin settings. <br /> <br /> This film is very important to French film lovers for a very special reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégé Raymonde that he wants an air exchange (atmosphere) because she does not understand the meaning of the film world atmosphere, the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) considers it an insult and delivers this line, which is undoubtedly the most famous of the whole French Films is: <br /> <br /> In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Translation attempt: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Do I have an atmosphere face?" This is our French "Nobody perfect".
