I loved this masterpiece and to be honest, I also found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) stupid and Saxon. Angela Lansbury plays her character perfectly and I do not know why people see this movie as distorted. It was magical and fun to watch. Every scene had a certain charm when you got to know the characters better. They really see how this small, jumbled family can learn to connect with each other despite their age and differences. I found the characters well-developed, especially Charles, who was in "The Age of Not-Believers". Mary Poppins may be more popular and appreciated by others, but this little gem will be the one I will always love and cherish.
