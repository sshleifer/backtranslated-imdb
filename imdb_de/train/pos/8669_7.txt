If, unlike some of the commentators, you do not wage a class war, then you do not mind seeing the lives of other people who are quite successful, extroverted, bohemian (gasping) and not fearsome at a party. Englishmen are a kind of trouble Result. This is not a bad movie, rather close to the Euro cinema than an imitation of the usual sloppy American garbage ... I think the minimal sound design and the cheap camera are more of a conscious decision than a bad movie production I would defend that Film is no worse than that, and it focuses on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie- thinking, that's her name because the sarcastic drunk is there). One exception is David Baddiel, who is never in serious things may appear !! It's easy, and we're not going for that kind of anatomy of relationship in this country, but if you do not have any real friends to go to a party with, you might be sitting in a worse place than sitting down and watching them.
