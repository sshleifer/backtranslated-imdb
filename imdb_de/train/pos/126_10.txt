Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers influenced by Film Noir, then this is just the cure for all those Hollywood summer blockbusters that clog the theaters these days. From Trier's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have received more recognition, but this is really his best work. It is striking without distracting, and offers the perfect combination of excitement and dark humor. It's too bad he decided that handheld cameras are the wave of the future. It's hard to say who talked him away from the style he's exhibiting here, but it's everyone's loss that he went in his theoretical dogma direction instead.
