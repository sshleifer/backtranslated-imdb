Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election sometimes feels like a longer image, with many characters and storylines abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of them are treated in the really outstanding and far superior sequel to Election 2: Harmony, but it is still a tantalizing thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootings and explosions (but not violence) of constantly changing alliances can change in the time needed for a phone call. It is also a film in which the most ruthless character is not always the most menacing, as the deterrent end only makes it too clear: one can imagine that lifelong psychological counseling is necessary for all the trauma that inflicts on an unfortunate onlooker. <br /> <br /> Simon Yam, too often a variable actor, but always in top form under his leadership, may never have starred, not least because Tony Leung's more extroverted performance makes his silence stronger.
