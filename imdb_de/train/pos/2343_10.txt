Thankfully, ABC picked this up instead of Fox. The best description (for connoisseurs) is really Wonderfalls Meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience of death and destiny makes me a fan of Brian Fuller early in life, but I definitely enjoy his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, pies, talking toys, pebbles, and other mischievous items :) While I'm a bit "Burtonesque," I think this enjoys its own niche, the J Depp or HB Carter not as a wonderfully resourceful playground needs. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood that crash into everyone and actually make sense and let us live life to the fullest!
