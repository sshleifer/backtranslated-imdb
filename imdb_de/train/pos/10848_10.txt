... heads, hands and feet - a band from the past, just like Strange Fruit. A triple whammy there. Those who claim not to like this movie are either heartless or under 40 and have no experience with reality. Sorry for you. This is a very well-watched small picture, which is an excellent way to overcome an hour or two and probably will not fade much at the second performance. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a fat drummer (in many ways the most adorable character of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic singer and frontman all make great performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a wonderful role due Eyes to go with some sharp actors like Karen who tries to keep the band together while spectacularly destroying themselves. <br /> <br /> The Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear, mock the hoople in front of everyone in their bloated ridiculousness, and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unjust for everyone. The next comparison is The Commitments, and that's not a bad thing. And any movie that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I can never remember, but the name lives on - well, it shows that someone in the team knew what it was all about. <br /> <br /> A little joy and thanks for the memory. Oh ... and I have another one - stiff little fingers; a-a-and what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS Anyone? (You have to watch the movie or were on the way)
