I know, it's fashionable to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of spooky movies, including the original 1963 Haunting and most Hammer movies. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all, which was probably why so many modern viewers did not like it. Still, many viewers can take movies like Scream out of control, because for most people, killer killer is easier to believe than demon or ghost. Actually, this movie had a lot of great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I've seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and did not try to find the realism of the sixth sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Maybe this film may appeal more to John Carpenter fans, but rather a traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a beautiful movie from 1963. He was even scary. With Pamela Franklin you can see both Innocents and The Legend of Hell House.
