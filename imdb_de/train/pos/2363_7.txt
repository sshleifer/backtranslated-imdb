This adaptation of MR James' short story "A View From A Hill" was first shown on UK television in 2005 on the small digital BBC 4 channel. Remember the BBC's successful adaptation of the 1970s to other stories by MR James, including " Whistle And I Come To You, My Boy "and" The Signalman ". Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "A View From A Hill" is still an entertaining and sometimes exciting drama. A historian arrives in a small rural village to collect the collection of a recently deceased collector of ancient artifacts. In the countryside he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does that have to do with old binoculars and a cruel legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what do the rugged Squire and his servant know about the situation? Although I was not scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production and if it had taken more than 40 minutes to complete, it would have been a really great adaptation. As it is, everything feels a little bit rushed and a bit more exposure to set the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give 7 out of 10 points.
