Is someone else crying when he sees this movie? I love it! One of my top 10 films ever. I just feel good. I keep looking at the final production number with all the actors again and again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE baby of the movie, IMHO! I've never seen the piece, but I get angry when I read reviews that say it's better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The film-making process will seldom deliver a finished product that remains true to the original work. I think it's only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known, on-screen works are not changed anymore than they are. This is a very good movie, it is very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
