Since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating must already be lowered. As this version stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, it helps. <br /> <br /> Is not this exactly how the United States government is to terrorize one of its own citizens? Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But the truth is, the government would do anything to destroy a man's life because he was trying to get home to his wife. A wife who is no less in work and may not succeed. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country that the police escorted a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the disc jockey. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were some great scenes, great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much deliberation, I gave this movie a 7.
