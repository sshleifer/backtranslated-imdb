Glamorous! I saw Domestic Import in Philly with my children in October. We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I have not heard her laugh like that for years! It was the first time I could remember a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's really cute and we can not wait for it to appear on DVD. You have to do more movies like domestic import. It's refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be ashamed of). I have not seen such a cute movie since My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is there too and he is weird. I remember him from WKRP.
