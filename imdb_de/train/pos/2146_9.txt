I just watched this adorable Japanese feature film at the 5th annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival at the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this movie, which is subtitled in English, has the ballroom as a heart, the film does indeed depict the world outside of Japan, such as the rigid structures of the family, employment (Salaryman), and rest in the world modern Japan still exist today. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the surname (surname) and the given name (surname)] using the less popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [I will not even use the names of the movies if the readers of the world may not be familiar with the Japanese formula names, which may be confusing. I refer to the <br /> <br /> actors with their professional acting name, as listed in the Internet Data Movie Base.] <br /> <br /> He asks for the help of his real wife, the professional ballet Dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and so far only film. She is a dance teacher in her father's dance studio. Her real ambition, however, is to once again participate in an international dance competition that previously disqualified her. No, I do not say why. Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. He's been a veteran of about 25 films since 1979 and gives an impressive performance of a 40-year-old corporate man who has a pretty wife, a teenage daughter, and has just bought the house of his house. <br /> <br /> longing. <br /> <br /> And yet something is missing in his inner happiness. Watch this movie to learn how to "get involved" in ballroom dancing and go secretly into class. Most dancing characters are freed from the traditional <br /> <br /> Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly and warm and welcoming. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to the structure of Japanese society, which in its philosophy is "room for everyone and everyone in their place." <br /> <br /> The movie has so many funny moments. The almost 1,500 theatergoers broke into spontaneous laughter in many of the comedic moments. This proves that comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as is Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny character actors. <br /> <br /> You could buy and read a college textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or you could watch this fine movie and start to understand how <br /> The people of Japan grow into one rather rigid social structure. Watch the movie "Shall we Dansu?" is a quick dip into further studies and watching other <br /> <br /> Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it'll make you cry a bit and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
