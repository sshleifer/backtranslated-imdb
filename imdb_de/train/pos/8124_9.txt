Apart from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is the oldest pure science fiction film. The film may be a bit preachy at times, and acting can be a bit broad, but it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it is very original in terms of style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films that are so similar to me. Secondly, the special effects of the time were absolutely incredible - with matte paintings, models and huge casts, amazing scenes of a post-apocalyptic world and a huge city of tomorrow were created. Sure, you could sit back and hit the movie because the effects are just so by today's standards. But you must know that this was the state of the art when the movie came out in 1936, and he really must have thrilled the audience. In many ways, the sets are reminiscent of the "modern cities" seen at WORLD'S FAIR in 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn apart by the question "are people really that stupid or are we destined for size?" The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> One last note: I've seen this twice on TV and recently on video. All three times stank the sound and print quality - especially the sound. If this is available on a DVD, it is hopefully much cleaner and offers optional subtitles. As the sound on the video became less and less, I really appreciated it!
