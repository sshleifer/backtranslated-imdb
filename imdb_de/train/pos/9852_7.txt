No day goes by without a new computer animation movie. So we really have a chance to see more than a few nice effects. After seeing Ice Age, it felt like it did not affect me as much as other films in the genre. <br /> <br /> But that's because I'm a big guy now and I'm pretty sure this is a movie very enjoyable movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is pretty simple and the "actors" are funny in a funny way, with no coarse or complex humor. Even the "bad guy" is a pretty, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a bit of a disappointment to me (knowing that most of the main characters are sadly doomed to extinction), but a great thing for kids. And apart from a few battles, nobody dies (not even when mauled several times by a mammoth), causing a carton-like feeling. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice, but apart from some, it's nothing special, really nice kartoony-feeling scenes, if you want to go for a nice picture or pages of a comic. [Which means a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There were some jokes that made me smile - I accept that creators tried to satisfy these adults - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion ) better go unnoticed because it does not feel like fitting into the story. All in all, it's a nice movie, but it's more of an ideal Disney clich√©. If you do not hate cute animals doing funny things, at least look at it.
