After the success of the second part, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should make a third appearance. Instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA-Rowan Atkinson) lives at the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" Butler George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). In this third series, Blackadder, the wonderfully written sitcom, tries everything to become rich and powerful. He tries to choose a lord for a dilapidated district, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a street man, and finally poses as a prince. This is a very good installment for the popular comedy. Contains performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 of the 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 of the comedians' comedian, and he was number 8 of Britain's favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 of the 100 Greatest TV characters and he was the number one 3 The world's biggest comedy characters and blackadder (all four series) were the # 2 UK's best sitcom. Outstanding!
