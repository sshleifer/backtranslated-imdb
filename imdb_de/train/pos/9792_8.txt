Once a year such a movie "comes" and makes it easy for you. You have no trouble thinking that it is good, it is just like that. You enjoy it while you see it, and you take it home. I can not say that it is absolutely flawless, but it is close by. Acting - great, story - interesting and with elements of tension. It's a little family history, pretty predictable, but not the secret itself is important. it's the way the blind girl needs it to reach it. I was impressed by how the director portrayed her deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like so much is the actress who played the mother, she was too hard and no need. Keren
