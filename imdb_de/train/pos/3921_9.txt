In Carmen, Saura again tries to create a dynamic connection between reality and fiction, between the actual passions of the personalities of a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance parts of the opera Carmen, and the scripted passions from the history of the fictional Carmen, the famous deadly mix from a free spirit (read the disregard of faithfulness) and their ability to drive men crazy with desire. Saura used this vehicle fiction / reality in an earlier black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tensions between the dancers who practiced Blood Wedding have proved to be beneficial, as they have become the fictitious characters in the story, directing their emotions into their roles, in Carmen the parallel between the small, libidinal drives The Dancer of The Troupe during the Rehearsals and the Ghost, who has to do with the myth of Carmen, never comes close to being credible. It remains a gadget and for that reason a distracting distraction. You really have to see the blood wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it hardly matters that melodrama Saura tries to impose his Carmen, because the flamenco dance and the guitar music of the rehearsals, which come to 95% from the film, is more than paid for by some of the most well-known flamenco dancers and musicians. A flawed movie and a miracle: Maybe perfect for drilling in Keats' negative capacity?
