... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). Apart from a big fan service for fan girls (well, that was superfluous ~), it was the story that blew me away. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people in this case will not agree with me, but it was not one of the three big actors (the guys who played Sho, Son and Kei) who did the best job (at least for me). It was Taro Yamamoto, Boy # 5 from Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like Hyde, I adore his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes were a bit off, but I loved the scene he danced with Body of the dead kills the other guys. and Gackt was not so bad, I preferred that his character was quite distant from the start. I can not say much about my background to Lee-Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast. <br /> <br /> This film has paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). While the entire song lasts about nine minutes, you will not notice the length since you would hear Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film is not only a must for the fans (huge fan base ~), but also for those who like sci-fi, futuristic films and Asian style.
