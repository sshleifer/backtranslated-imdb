This movie earned every one of the ten voices I gave him! Thank you for making a great movie. You've shown the world that you can write, direct, produce, and play in a black movie without negative stereotypes. The poetry was also great, ahead of the poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I looked at her last night when I fell in love with my sweetheart. I will include it in my film collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <br /> <br /> Thanks again and the best wishes and congratulations to you!
