Good action show, but nothing new. This took place high in the mountains, which showed some beautiful landscapes and the like. A man picks up a group of mercenaries, the main flies, and he kicks his ass. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was this Pat. It had a very effective scene, right on the first movie, when I cringed in horror. Not a bad picture, but exactly the same, the same.
