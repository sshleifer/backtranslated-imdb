I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas when he came out in 1986. I remember they gave prizes for watching the movie. After watching the movie, I can see why. The movie was neither bad nor great. The problem with this movie was that he tried to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap them around the Masters saga. My biggest complaint is that it's a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking Earth. They even used the same scenes from the Master Saga, but with different dialogues. As a kid, I loved the movie. Unfortunately, I have not seen it as an adult and can not give a better rating. In retrospect, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the movie and reevaluate my attitude. Will someone publish this movie so that it can be judged by the whole world? I love Robotech and can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
