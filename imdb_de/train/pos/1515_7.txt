In the '70s, Amicus made a good half dozen of these horror anthologies, and this is one of the best efforts of leading horror writer Robert Bloch. There are four stories that are all worthwhile, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - are extremely effective journeys into fear. <br /> <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose adorable daughter (Chloe Franks) annoys his neglect and brutal intolerance, forming a voodoo doll that expresses her aversion to his Expresses methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of malicious evil and delivers since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents" one of the biggest children's performances in a horror movie. This episode is conducted with great subtlety and the last indignation outside the screen is a moment of pure horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, the creepy Dominic. This episode captivates with its simplicity and strong terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The short shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting ghost on a meadow are really haunting. The original poster art with a skeletal figure clasping a tray of Peter Cushing's severed head was a lure for poker players with fear.
