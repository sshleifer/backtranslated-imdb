In 1933, many cuts were made to this film because it was overkill for the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced his daughter to prostitution at the age of 14. She grew up in a steelworks town with very poor people, and her dad led a speakeasy that brought all sorts of male characters into his house that had Lily's eye on them. As the story progresses, Lily meets man by man and eventually finds a man who has everything and is a Playboy bank president. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.), who was only 25 at this picture, and Jimmy did not even come to the first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) plays with Barbara Stanwyck and both have shown outstanding performances. This is a great movie from 1933, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and locked in debt for many years and recently shown on screen. Compared to what we see on the Hollywood screens today, this movie is rather mild, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this kind of movie. Enjoy
