I borrowed this movie last weekend, powered up the surround sound system, and got great sounds from some special effects. This movie is a great movie rental. The special effects were enough to scare my fianc√©, but I saw that some of them were surprisingly computer generated. I did not go to the movies and saw it, but it's a scary night and I do not feel like watching a movie. I would recommend it!
