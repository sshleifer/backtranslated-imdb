This movie is neither pathological nor depressing. It is sad because AIDS was sad in the early 90's. The real message, however, is love and perseverance. Mark and Tom have been in a loving relationship for many years. Their dedication to each other is immediately apparent, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, they see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care and worked volunteer as a counselor in an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its time, because Mark and Tom were real people and lived exactly the experiences I experienced every day in real life. I knew first-hand what it was like to see AIDS looking away on formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; Seeing Mark and Tom appear in the movie was very similar, as if watching my real friends deteriorate. It touched me so much that it still touches me after all these years.
