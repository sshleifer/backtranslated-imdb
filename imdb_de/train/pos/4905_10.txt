"An album of songs that are so old everyone thinks they're new." This movie has the elusive combination of tempo and mood that sets some movies apart from the opening moments. And why not? Highly gifted talent of Dame Judith Dench as a widow playing saxophone with a street musician to help him find the right songs, to Olympia Dukakis as a happy widow living in a Scottish castle, in connection with her many marriages, to Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all members of a World War II (more or less) Swingband. But wait, there is more. Add to that Leslie Caron on bass and the incomparable Clio Laine as lead vocalist, and the Blonde Bombshells are the hottest band in England since the Beatles. OK, not really, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the entire movie reuniting the Blonde Bombshells to play in the school dance of her granddaughter. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and brave it would be for a group of sex women to step on the stage before the Britney Spears generation after an act titled "Open Wound" Career of the actresses is over at 30 years, the second album of most bands is a great hits compilation, and music that is more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay, it is great, real talent, real music and a lot to see Really good movies come from, where else the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know I will watch it a lot more and enjoy more each time.
