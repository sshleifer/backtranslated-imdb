"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of John Hughes' 80s films. Everything takes place in a world where everyone has an attraction. There are some easy-to-solve conflicts that occasionally are detrimental to the most happy processes. Countless actions are summarized in montages to hopping pop sounds. Nothing against it. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute pleasure from start to finish. My wife and I were absolutely thrilled with the Cornball cheese dairy, even as we made fun of it, and in the end, as embarrassing as it is, we applauded (and we saw room in our lives, not in a theater ). Watch and enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
