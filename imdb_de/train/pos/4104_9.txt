It is helpful if you understand Czech and see it in the original language and understand the obsession of the Czechs of "The Professionals". If not, "Jedna Ruka Netlaska" is another Czech film. It's funny, dark and very pleasant. The biggest compliment I can pay for is that you never know exactly what's going to happen next, and the feeling that you can move well in the second and third sightseeing as well is amazing world class movie and literature, from Hrabal , Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor is by nature dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This film is just that, it is unfriendly and deals with the less endearing aspects of people, but below that there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intention and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this and most of the other projects involving Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for that very reason - at any rate it's as close as the Czechs will ever write a really happy ending ...
