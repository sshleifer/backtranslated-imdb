Buster shines absolutely in this episode. This is the only vehicle I saw near the end of my career that allowed him to do the physical (and quiet!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his gritty voice in the talkie sequences - for Buster, his voice is the only thing I do not care about - but his ability to take a pratfall is still beyond compare. He even reviews some of the gags used in his early two roles with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us this episode and giving Buster's genius full scope. He did not have much time (an episode) to do that, but this is a touching tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
