Fever Pitch is a fun movie. There are many funny moments (including an incredibly disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, there's a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she breaks with me" stuff happens, but other than that, it's funny to the end. > Although the plot is fanatic about the Red Sox, it's not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I can easily say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a kid. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
