Albuquerque is a movie that contains all the elements of a Western Class A, except one: the story that really belongs to a class B or C west in color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. Even so, it is entertaining for people who like old westerns, the original color and sound are very well preserved on the recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good buddy, Lon Chaney is mean as usual and Randolph Scott a little happier than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you would expect something that would remind you of the city, but the city shown here could just be anywhere.
