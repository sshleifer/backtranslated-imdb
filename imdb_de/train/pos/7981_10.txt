In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin and currently a decadent alcoholic John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), on the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita ( Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, brings him back to life and smiles, and he feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she has been murdered by the criminals, he vows to kill everyone responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will surely become a masterpiece of a future classic. The story is excellent, never stupid and although the viewer runs 146 minutes, he does not feel that time is passing. The cast consists of outstanding actors and actresses. Their performances are outstanding and underline Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The camera has wonderful moments and the script has stunning lines. Personally, I loved it when Christopher Walken Manzano's figure (Giancarlo Giannini) explains that Creasey's specialty is death and he prepares his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best movie of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
