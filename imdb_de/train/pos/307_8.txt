"They All Laughed" is one of those little movies that I always recommend to friends who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the tradition of screwball romance of the past, but seems to be more contemporary. Even the very early 80's atmosphere does not mean much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole company on its feet so easily that reality will never bring it to Earth. But that said, this sweet little movie is totally dependent on the actors to keep it going, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream cast that understands the demands of this kind of story. It's a movie that would not be remembered for so long had it not been for the small moments of the outstanding cast: Colleen Camp is simultaneously yelling at John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak released his hair under his hat. and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls on John Ritter and says "how ... weird." It's such a bit of fluff that you do not want to put too much out of fear for crushing it, but it's certainly a light heart and a smile on your face.
