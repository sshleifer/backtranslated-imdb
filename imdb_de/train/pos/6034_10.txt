Last November I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a lot of fun. Apart from a few technical mistakes, it was a great experience. I really loved writing and acting, especially the man who starred. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of joke. I had the opportunity to talk to some filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed to be really nice. All in all, the whole movie was just a positive experience and I would definitely recommend it. The story was entertaining and cool, as a woman I've been through many of the same issues as the lead actor, so I really understand his problems. The film is a great work to convey to people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know such people, I only wish Imy friends and I could sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just cool, I wish there were more movies like him. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
