If you've lived through the '60s, this movie can sometimes be painful and sometimes quite cheerful. Everything is there, except the fine print in the then prevailing counterculture tabloid. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still going on: "Do not talk too early, because the wheel is still spinning in circles, because the times in which they change". While focusing on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its diffusion at the time, the film alone played a huge role in the development of intelligence, influenced engineers, scientists, and contributed to the development of computer activities. A greeting to the filmmakers of one of them was there - they captured the era better than I've ever seen.
