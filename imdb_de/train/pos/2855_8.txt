Non-Stop is an entertaining and content-rich movie that has earned comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly evolves into a chase sequence in which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. The hunt does not serve as a rapid climax, but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film. During the "run," we see the characters grow and forget their bleak lives for a moment, the "macho" roles they've shopped into, and finally forget why they even started walking. Just as fighting gave the characters in "Fight Club" "clarity," running offers the characters of this film the opportunity to distance themselves from the false values ​​that we all allow for society. Their running serves to truly taste life from an unalloyed perspective, and all three find a degree of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My esteem and joy at the end of the film fluctuated only slightly. Rather than learning from their experiences, the characters seem to play the wrong macho roles that I thought had escaped on their journey. Still, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed earlier outside of Japan.
