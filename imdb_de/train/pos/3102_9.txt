I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved it. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia CIA agent who is running away trying to figure out who he is Like I said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was just right and it goes well with the other films, but it was much better in every way. <br /> <br /> Best stunts, chases, actors and effects that I've seen all summer in an action movie (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, pirates, etc.), but I was not 'in this movie It's not just about killing Jason and running. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so the drama is there. But that will not slow you down. <br /> <br /> Among all the "threequels" that came out last summer, this was the best.
