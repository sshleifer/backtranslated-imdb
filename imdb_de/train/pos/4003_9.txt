A woman left alone after her husband's death is attracted to her boyfriend and handy man. In a slightly twisted story, the woman starts to sleep with the handy man to revive. The twisted part? The handy man is also the love interest of her daughter. <br /> <br /> As if that were not strange enough, the mother manages to fall in love with this man, and when her daughter learns about it, she not only blames her dysfunctional relationship, but also her ruined life with hers poor mother. <br /> <br /> Even if you think badly about this woman, the truth is that the movie manages to portray it in a positive light. This beautifully played by Anne Reid character has large dimensions and shows great emotions. <br /> <br /> A really brilliant performance and a fun movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
