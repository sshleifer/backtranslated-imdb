I knew Jackass was a similar program, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it's the same, but more extreme. Basically, three Welsh boys and a crazy British guy were brought together for skateboarding, and it was a utterly disregarding / masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They had been puking, eating pizza covered in ham, jumping in burning nettles, naked paintballing, jokes about the smaller guy while they were sleeping / snoring heavily, doing stunts at a work place, such as eating. Army, cowboys, and many other crazy stunts that cause bruising, bumps, blood, and vomiting, may not be just for yourself. With Lee, who does just about everything, Lee Dainton is also good for everything, Dan Joyce (the Brit ), who does hardly any physical stuff and has a OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke), who does a lot, but is more popular for short, fat and lazy. It was number one on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very well!
