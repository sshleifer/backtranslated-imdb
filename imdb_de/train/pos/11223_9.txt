Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the gambling world proud. The various wrists movements had to be learned, because throwing craps is in and of itself a skill. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I had fully expected the "good girl" to cry over his grave rather than his buddy. Especially with her remarks about the "funeral of her best friend" when she met Matt for the first time. And then of course you expect Matt to kill the man who dumped Mr. Allen in the face with battery acid and blinded him (interesting role of Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood endings happen, but writing is so great, acting is so careful that you are unaware. <br /> <br /> And the music is OUTSIDE THE WORLD. Back in the 50s, when our "domestic passions" were unleashed for the first time by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a bit of racism was an ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag supporting the racist remarks. I'll take a look again, just to hear the music. Well, I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack so I can hear that in the car. Look at them both, and you'll see how Matt has matured. Well, he owns a bar at the Paramount Hotel in New York, so he probably has a good opportunity to get his degree. Great actor who is just coming to his own. He shows finely nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in his characters. His "Boy from the Farm" is a great study that is particularly poignant with his Bassett eyes. He loves to convince himself. Having worked as a teenager with Diane Lane in several films, I wonder how ... making love with an actress you grew up with somehow. Add conviction, I say that.
