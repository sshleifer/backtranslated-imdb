The barbarians may not be the best movie that each of us has seen, but really ... It's so funny ... I can not describe how funny I laughed when I saw it for the first time ... The Director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it's so bad ... so bad that it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see it .. ... and if you have already done it, see it again !!!!!!!
