Disney (and the wonderful people of PIXAR of course) offer a beautiful, humorous story, combined with the best computer animation. I admit that the "faces" of the beetles were perhaps a bit more static than in "Antz" and they only had four legs (in "Antz" six ...). But the backgrounds were superb and the animation was breathtaking. But let's just make this a lesson: not the computer has made it a success: it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists that I missed in Antz. Of course some highlights were the "Bloopers" at the end (so look at the end, it's worth it!) That were very amusing and original. The line "Filmed on location" was intended for the attentive viewer.
