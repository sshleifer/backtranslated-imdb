Most people miss Hollywood's concept. If a hero within a law can encourage heroic acts for a child, I agree with the lessons taught by Doc Savage to the public and government are looking for heroes to decorate them. The movie industry brings heroes to the screen that people can identify with - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. For more than a generation, Doc Savage is remembered as the best of the best in the presence of James Bond, Superman, or any of the others. All others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not the Bronze Man.
