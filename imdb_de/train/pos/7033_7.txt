Do NOT call this a remake of the '63 movie. Although this version is more suitable for the play, it is extremely long. The casting was good, with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. She was almost 30 when she made this movie, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he got a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates her role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee, and showed that he could even hold a tune. Like the '63 movie, they cast a stranger to Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it turned out. I even have the soundtrack and I like to hear his vocals. So, what did that make a TV flop? It was long for one. You have added new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Do not get me wrong now, I like it, but I prefer to watch the 63 movie (see my review). This was just a case where some actors had outperformed their roles, making some changes and again LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give her any lyrics and she could sing it. Here's my advice from someone who has done some Bye Bye Birdie productions: If you want to watch a fun version of the piece, watch the movie '63. If you want to see a version that matches the game more, check out the '95 version. Take it in moderation. Do not be a hero and look at everything in one sitting.
