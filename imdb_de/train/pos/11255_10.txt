This is undoubtedly my favorite novel by Le Carre and will be turned to canvas with all the love and care one could ask for. I read a review on this site that would find the characters abhorrent, but I believe that misses the point. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories, and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Betrayal is the key of all for the benefit of nobody. Pym's upbringing is so close to my own that I watch it freezing. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late-complaining Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles of Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are just right. This cast is a dream of the theater impresario. The story should not be tainted by poorly informed descriptions, but is enough to say that it is a young man who is slowly but surely destroyed and descends into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies relate to Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - as wonderful as ever, his only true friendship, but by definition another in the long line of betrayal.) Love it.
