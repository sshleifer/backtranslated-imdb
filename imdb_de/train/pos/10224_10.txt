... and I'm serious. If not literally (after all, I have not seen any movie ever!), At least of course among the many I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The rule of thumb for IMDb is: Sometimes films that are rated very high (for example, "Oldboy", Kannes-Competition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap) are really bad. But rarely is a movie that is worth to be seen rated below 6. This movie is very worth seeing. A shame. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. The true rating should be an 8 or a 9. She has some mistakes (especially Belafonte), the script sometimes wanders. What we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger than life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a dramatic / poetic / moral act of strength. A couple made in heaven! It is true that, apart from minor flaws, this film is not suitable for the average audience, but those who are interested in watching an outstanding (and not uncritical) film by the unrivaled director who told us "The Shop on the Main Street ". (the best film about the Holocaust) should not miss this just because some stupid IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> That's not it.
