It seems like this movie polarises us. You love it or hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the commentary (comments) that says you just have to "feel it". <br /> <br /> Also at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small swabs so that the close-up painting looks like a mess, but from afar you can see what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I think that's a clue for the moviegoer. This film is like this Impressionist painting. It is impressionistic filmmaking! It is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to this painting. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical linear representation. It requires more thought. There are symbols and there are scenes that jump around and no, you will not always be sure what's going on. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You have to focus on this movie, but I think people make the mistake of focusing too much on it. After the end you should think about it. If you try to figure out how it unfolds, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... "go" with ... stay open. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the services top-notch and considered them to be extraordinarily unique, wildly creative and intriguing. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those who did not enjoy it. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual films, then look at it. If you prefer something lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you really like what I've described then you'll enjoy it.
