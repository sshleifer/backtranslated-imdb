ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Director: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> with Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> <br / > Conspiracy: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her television program and heads to the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes, to collect the inheritance of her dead aunt and hopes to raise a lot of money for a show in Vegas. Unfortunately, she only gets a scary old house, a poodle and a magical cookbook. In Fallwell, Elvira seeks to make money, breathe life into the youth, win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), not burn at the stake, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard). Who plans to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and witty woman and as Elvira she is all that plus morbid and funny naivety, not to mention that she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this film, their charms come into their own. <br /> <br /> I loved all the 'fish out of the water' feeling in the movie. They have Elvira with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair and her enormous "twins". She is in a Christian city where most girls are not allowed to wear make-up. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as great as Elvira's uncle / nemesis Vincent who wants to steal the book to use it for evil. He is very present but still does not bother and steals scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from fool jokes to horror spoofing is here, making me laugh more than anything else from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I've heard that there are about 56 jokes in this movie and every fan of Roger Corman B-horror movie will love the spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
