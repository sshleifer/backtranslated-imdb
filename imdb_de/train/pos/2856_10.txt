This is one of the movies that gets better and better when you see them. There are so many original and unconventional ideas that you will always find a new detail. As in the following films by Sabu (I have not yet seen "Unlucky Monkey", but the others are just as big), failure, chance and humanism play a big role. The cut and the montage are imaginative and artistic, without the film being an "art" image, but a very entertaining one. When comparing "Run, Lola, Run" one has to keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was made a few years ago and was already broadcast on German television in 1997. Tom Tykwer's film and not vice versa. In addition to the other reviews, I have to add that I really like the acting and the ending. This movie is in many ways a lot of fun and he manages to deliver a message without being annoying or overbearing.
