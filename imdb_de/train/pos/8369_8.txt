Hm-I think this line is from the old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film translated from a language completely unknown to the translator. Here is a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they must explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "in the future ..." means that nations instead of wars have to fight giant robots and duke it out to find out, well, that's never terribly clear, but it is probably something really important. There are good people (obviously capitalists, so "we") and evil (commies!), And there are big stop motion robots. Unfortunately, the budget for the effects was pretty low, so we do not do anything. I see many of the big robots. There are many cheap looking indoor scenes and then a big space fight towards the end. Space combat is especially nice because it serves exactly the purpose of wiping out the rest of the effect budget. <br /> <br /> When the money is spent now, the climatic struggle (and I do not) degenerates. Two boys hit each other with sticks. I can always laugh in a bar when I have replayed the final scene. One last line guarantees that every audience will scratch their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
