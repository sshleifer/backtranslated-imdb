This movie is shockingly underestimated on IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it's a pretty good, albeit predictable dance contest / personal growth movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half looking for a kind of 8 mile for a female dancer, I think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb reviews, my guess is that this is the case The movie approached the top 250 and was bombarded with many "1s". This happens with so many movies that do not deal with the mob, have no special effects, or contain non-white or straight characters. <br /> It's an American movie, but not a US movie. Located mostly in Toronto, the cues are subtle, and some viewers may think that it plays completely in the US just because the final competition takes place in the border town of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know about it). The characters were good for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title is shit. I do not remember anyone in the movie who said those words and it should have an "s". (No, it is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There's not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a 1 vote means you hated it), so I can only assume it's a movie Expression of hatred for the kind of people, and that is sad.
