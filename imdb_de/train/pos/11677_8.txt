I loved Long Way Round and did not realize the Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my supermarket. I bought it and after a bit hmm, this will be the first episode, I decided that it was so. Charlie Boorman was great, as was the other members of the crew. Nice to see him again at Ewan. There was a bit of swearing in it, but that did not bother me. As they are not mentioned on the package. This has more to do with the stupid Exempt from Classification certificate owned by the BBFC. They should have given him a 15 for the language only. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more!
