Hi: <br /> <br /> I've heard of a colleague who had obvious disagreements about entertainment. He loved it. Well, I saw one or two episodes in the early seasons and was bored, so I shut them off. After a few years, I stumbled lost; bored with the current sci-fi tariff. Wow, I was surprised. Can you say goodbye to gravity, damn it, I got sucked in. The tempo and the scripting are very good, so some of the flash forward / backward moves are so on the Lamer characters, but overall good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael are definitely immature assholes, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was more stylish than Kate. Mr. Eko was widely undervalued and on the level of Charlie, if not more, too bad that both died. The black-clad man talking to Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. All in all, a great, multi-layered series: looking for more. <br /> <br /> Greetings
