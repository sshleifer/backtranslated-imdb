I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and never forgot it. The film shows the horror of war in a way Hollywood usually glosses over. The relationship between the soldiers of the two belligerent countries is underlined by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we all really do not differ. If you can find a copy of it, buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just impressed.
