This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric movie. If there is such thing as "intellectual horror cinema," then this movie is it. I got scared and wished someone would watch it with me, and it hardly has a conspiracy! I have to see this movie several times before I feel I really understand it. If you're a person who likes "My Dinner With Andre" and Godard films, or if you're taking a lot of mind-altering drugs, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Impressive.
