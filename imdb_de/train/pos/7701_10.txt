This has always been one of my favorite movies and always will be. In the last few years, I've become a fifties / '60 sci-fi freak and have been trying to collect all the better ones that were done back then. I love a lot of things about them, how stupid they might be, how technical some of them were. The great colors and the sets also get me going. It is a pity if they make some of these good old films new; They almost always fill up everything - just look at the last reissue of the day the earth stopped, it's total garbage !! Forbidden Planet is one of the space movies of all time, and now they're trying to make it new, and I shudder to wonder what the new movie will look like. I think some things, like fantastic classic movies, should just be left as they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and get people excited. If they've added all the techno crap that's available to us now, the movie seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I note that the uniforms of the astronauts on the forbidden planet were also used as the "Queen of Space"! That just tells you that budgets were a bit lower back then, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen in a serious role and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorites) actor) , Earl Holiman and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and the plot is not too far-fetched. This is a great science fiction experience!
