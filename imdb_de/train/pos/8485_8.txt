Gung Ho tries to express many ideas while entertaining a wiseguy comedy. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character well. Wantabedde is even better. A warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a pretty pleasant time capsule.
