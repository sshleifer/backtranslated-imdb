I remember being a kid when I saw this movie for the first time. It was my first horror movie (so maybe I can still remember some parts of the movie). I do not remember much about acting, nude scenes, or anything else, but I remember a man being blown up with a grenade, a man being dismembered over a tree, and a guy driving a truck down and down was shot in the head. (Todd Schaefer.), Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland. I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister tore off the killer stomach to get the truck's keys. It's a movie that gives you the creeper and is worth a look. But where do I find that? How can I download it?
