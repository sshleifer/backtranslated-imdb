I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It's not preaching, it's not morally grounded, it should not be controversial. It is only God. Any god, regardless of religion. And it's really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who is usually on the lighter side of the news and desperately trying to prove (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously Do a good job in an anchor job. This drive slowly drives away his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last straws are carried out, he does not laugh quickly, but cries to God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce makes his life better for himself until he guilty of helping others, where he always misses the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant agitation over his own life makes him more selfish and leaves his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, that was kind of long. But as an action, it works well. The gradual way in which we face the challenges of being God is much better than pooling our problems and can hide pretty well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know, you know that Carrey's perfect play in his character (luckily for him) remains with the movie in the first place, controlling scene after scene and giving the movie a sense of humor. Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humor would be flat, since humor is half an execution. And the humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrey it would somehow feel like it was a Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some say, is not the only excuse for the third act. At least you do not believe that when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and lets you forget that you are watching a movie. She and Carrey feel very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels like ggooooodd (see the movie for understanding), has a very good feeling, attacks the idea appropriately and better than expected and should never have been called beat up, just to Carreys Save career (which went nowhere).
