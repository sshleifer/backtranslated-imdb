Perhaps the biggest movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot keeps following my reverie. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a pleasure (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music. It is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All lovers of jazz and film noir should study this incredible gem. <br /> <br /> What shade and light - what music - what a hat!
