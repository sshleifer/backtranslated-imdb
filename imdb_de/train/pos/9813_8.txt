This episode introduced the holodeck to the TNG world. The Jarada needs to be contacted, and an exact greeting must be given, otherwise it would be very offended. A tired Picard chooses a trip to the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins. The settings are superb and almost like a movie. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards the Jarada probe damaged the holodeck and all of its safety devices are no longer working. Picard and now the guests must outsmart the gangsters of America's 40s and return to Jarada Rendezvous. Picard welcomes the Jarada properly and a new day dawns between humanity and the Jarada. This gem of a season one episode was the Holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures
