Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas I've ever seen when I talk about movies. They had only a landscape, a series of actors and an action. What made it so special was the effective direction, the great dialogues and the bizarre condition that characters like rats had to behave in a labyrinth. His second movie "Cypher" (2002) was all about his story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here the characters are re-tested as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and brings Vincenzo back to his 'Cube Days' by locking the characters into another room and not spending time with the characters, as with rats to play in an experience space. Instead of a sci-fi thriller (even some of the misleading advertising teasers and trailers seemed to be so), "Nothing" is a laid back and light comedy that can certainly be described as a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we live. Once again, Vicenzo amazes us with a great idea for such a small thing. 2 actors and a dazzling white scenario, that's all you have most of the time and you do not need more. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" is confusing, "Nothing" is completely the opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that a clever idea means far more just a millionaire budget. Of course, the film sometimes fails, but its basic idea means a lot and corrects mistakes. There is nothing more to say about this film, because everything is a brilliant surprise and a completely different experience I've had in films since "Cube".
