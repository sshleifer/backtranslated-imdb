McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see that. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is told in flashback mode, and it's an otherwise normal and happy family of three who is going through a very bizarre situation. I can not say much more without spoiling the movie, sorry. Just know, if you decide to look at it, you will at least be surprised. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of running these kids, and his acting is great. McConaughey's acting is solid and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> This movie asks you to think. Is dad crazy? Is there a god? Are there any demons? How far would you go to correct a mistake? And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> <br /> And that's why I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of the movies that deserve and reward a second or even third sight.
