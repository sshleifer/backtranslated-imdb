This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me. The depiction of the court of Chancery as a "character" in the drama is great. The spectacle is wonderful, from the eerie Tulkinghorn to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But the law firm's spider web keeps it together and the cinematography is superb. What bug did the BBC make of copyright, which meant that this version in the UK could not be seen on video or on DVD for many years? I tried to find out but stood in front of a stone wall. In the end, I got a DVD copy from Canada.
