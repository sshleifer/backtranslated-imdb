Clair Denis once again addresses his theme of estranged fathers, men determined to follow their own bliss, regardless of their family's emotions, while Nénette and Boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of Marseille, our study of Louis Trebor in The Intruder leads us from a secluded spot along the Franco-Swiss border to half the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again, the movie begins in the middle of the stream, with Louis in his sixties, coping with a sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, as his cabin regularly smugglers and shootings take place. Louis sleeps with a big knife under his pillow and guns nearby. Denis is in no hurry to push the action forward, and we must patiently understand our understanding of Louis in his daily activities and the few people he deals with at the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable, with long hair and a long hand), removing a mustache), which rejects him as a "madman": shown as a dedicated double father. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly incoherent, give an idea of ​​Louis and his milieu. Ms. Godard's camera work is intoxicating here. The controlling metaphor is Louis 'heart transplant, for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to seek another son who was not found, and where Louis' new heart rejects him, just as Sidney rejected the old one. We are used to making short scenes in Denis' film that are inexplicable: Nénette straddles Boni, who feeds with a spoon; a ride by shooting Boni's father and then the shortest shot of bonuses with a bullet wound in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a carcass with the scar of a transplant, but the corpse of Sidney. The implication of the last two is a rejection that a father really or imagined kills something that is indefinable in a son.
