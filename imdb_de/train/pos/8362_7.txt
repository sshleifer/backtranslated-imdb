Updated version of a story that had been turned into the movie England (Return of the Frog) in 1938, in reference to the persecution of a master criminal known as a frog for frog-like emergence (protruding eyes, etc.) that he wears. <br /> <br /> One of the good 1960s Wallace films is a solid little conversation. The frog, clearly influenced by (or influenced by) the reboot of the Dr Mabuse films, seems to be more a super villain than a master thief. Although this is not the best of the Wallace films, it's worth a look. It would be an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
