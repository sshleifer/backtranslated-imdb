Do not let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this classic by Romy Schneider. This film was shot on a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to do so. For example, England is represented as bordering on Germany by faulty ride alone. They arrived too fast. This probably could not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she says she is queen, she goes to the royal room, where the members of the court bow to her, where are the British citizens outside the castle and cheering for their new queen? Why does not she show up on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where was the audience then aware of this imperfection? I wonder how the critics felt: while she's in the interior scene, she meets Prince Albert, but that does not please him. During the meeting on the diners side of the inn, you will hear music from famous old American Civil War songs like "My old Kentucky home" and "Old black Joe". What? Civil War songs in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider represented as a Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Does Magna Shnieder play her too? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in mind in Marishka? Well, this adds to the camp. It is an unintentionally satirizing story by Queen Victoria. This is the only reason why you should collect it or see that 03 11 09 Germany and England are connected
