The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (obviously not his act together) need money. Andy has come up with a program to get something that will affect the entire Hanson family. This movie delivers. This is a multi-layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what she's doing. As a thriller or thriller I would like to compare it with "No Country For Old Men". While both films have plenty of character drama and thrills, 'Devil' is more on the thriller side because of its high tempo. "No Country" is a colder and gritty movie that you can really admire, while "Devil" is a bit more fun. There is definitely less violence in "Devil" than in "No Country". The acting also delivers. Ethan Hawke, who used to be made of wood in the past, brings besieged Hank with the jitters, sweat, and deer in the headlights. Philip Seymour Hoffman has Andy as the toughest scenes in the film and quickly becomes an actor that you believe can do it all. <br /> <br /> There is not much wrong with this movie. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. The events are out of control, but the movie is never the case - the writing (from the first timer Kelly Masterson), the director (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing remain as tight as a drum. In many categories this is award-winning stuff, though perhaps films like "The Departed" and "No Country" put this film out of the limelight. If you liked them, you will like this.
