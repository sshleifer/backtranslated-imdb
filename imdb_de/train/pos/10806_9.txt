I felt this movie - consistently. I was impressed with Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a typical Australian blend of gentle-gentle approach, a bit self-deprecating and very persevering. Really excited about the camera and directing. The pace was just right and the image of almost all the characters was impressive. <br /> Gosh, Russell's talent did not even shine in 1993! .. and I still have to see Gladiator.
