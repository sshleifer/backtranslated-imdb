Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb rate a low budget as not good. Whatever the movie needs, more budget is not included. Big sets and many special effects would have made another Lara Croft movie out of it. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden fascinates as a puzzling Modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. Her wise little smile and knowing look are impressive and you wish the camera will not lose face. It makes it possible that the villain Nikolai, played by (at least little known in the US) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, has an unusually cerebral interest in her, something that Modesty can exploit. She is able to distract and spit out his rape with just one nudge "Stop wasting my time!" then he stormed between his heavily armed and suddenly intrusive henchmen. Making a scene like this plausible does not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with the shabby Staden playing Modesty is that it's just not credible that it goes hand in hand with an athletic and muscular looking guy like Coaster Waldau and hit him. She's just not Peta Wilson or an inflated Hilary Swank actress who can make a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau, overwhelmed by Staden, looks like he's only battling with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not an action movie, that's not a big mistake. I just hope they do better if and when they do sequels.
