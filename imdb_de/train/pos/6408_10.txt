A classic Hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre. Both Gooding and DeNiro are both doing spectacularly well in the two main roles, and the understudy is consistently outstanding, with outstanding performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "niche" I could choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance, which was fine, it was just that the film added two unnecessary scenes Apart from that, the characterizations, the dynamics and the plot of the real story are fascinating and memorable. The evolution of the main characters and the way their beings evolve is shaped in a unique way by the performing artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, the tempo is maintained throughout. The score is also terrific. <br /> <br /> Is this a predictable Hollywood movie? So you bet Mike Leigh addicts should pull off a star, but everyone else should have a great time.
