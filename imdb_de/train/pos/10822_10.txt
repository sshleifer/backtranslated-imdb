I was lucky enough to see this movie in England many years ago. I've seen hundreds of movies since then, but I've never forgotten this. Although Sinatra played a not very likable character, he was outstanding in the role. Many people seem to think that he did not really get his own role until his role in "From Here To Eternity", but in my opinion he was great at Concho. The other role that comes to my mind is that of William Conrad. I never saw or heard him before this movie. Conrad plays a great role in this movie. I remember his deep and harsh voice and he miraculously uses it to amplify the few words he speaks with a threat that determines the tone of his character and seems to surround him whenever he appears. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never had a chance to see him again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the titles that it is said that the film is in black and white, but when I saw that it was actually in color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
