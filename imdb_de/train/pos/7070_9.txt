One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam movie is that the well-matched images, the disturbing scenery, and the manic frustrated characters prove the Creator's involvement. Instead of most films (where the filmmaker is a director paid to show one or two stars), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 Monkeys" bears witness to Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to offbeat films for himself. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes in Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, the protagonist's loneliness, the disbelief-related frustration and parallel areas. In this film, Gilliam succeeds in blurring lines between the two areas, using ambiguity to force the audience to believe instead of knowing it. This tendency of Gilliam not to fill certain gaps, leads to criticism of the Kunsthaus splendor. The difference between Gilliam and Artsy Posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all his imagery has meaning. The two almost identical bathing scenes of Cole at the beginning are to make comparisons that make the audience restless. His bald head is a sign of unity in the disease-plagued future world, but makes him recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a hallmark of Gilliam's creativity, as much of the story has to be tried out to fully understand its meaning. All in all, Gilliam's commitment is to make creative films that are interesting, but also need to be thought and interpreted by the audience. The movie has a tremendous replay value, as subtle details and clues can be overlooked at first glance. Definitely one of my favorites.
