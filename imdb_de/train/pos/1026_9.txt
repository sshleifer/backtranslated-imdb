I enjoyed this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers wore the show with the capable support of regulars and returning actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is just enormous. They feel that the actors like to move after stopping the camera. This relationship will be translated into the program that we will see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives his 'O'Neill' character a believable personality. He never knows when to silence the wisdom in him. You see the others rolling their eyes in dismay at some of his comments. Nevertheless, they know that he is the man in a dangerous situation. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill'. They manage to hold the lid, but often just barely. Season 1 episode Solitudes had one of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they were facing each other. <br /> <br /> 'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to overcome the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. But the tactical instincts of O'Neill always seem to be healthy. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team was endangered several times when the others did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> In seasons 9 and 10, the quality dropped noticeably. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new bad guys never really got me interested. Ben Browder was far inferior to the RDA in conducting the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping telephoned in her two seasons with their performances. They could see how their looks changed a lot after getting a baby. She probably thought more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but is usually weaker. The main characters lack the chemistry of casting the original. The rogues (Wraiths) are so unlikely they are ridiculous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe life into the program or it will not be longer than the fourth season. <br /> <br /> The special effects for the show have always been a problem for me. Shaping spaceships as pyramids is a design monstrosity rarely achieved in sci-fi. The use of torches to illuminate these ships is just as bad. The camping use of decor from ancient Egypt, which hides ultramodern technology, is just as hard to accept. <br /> <br /> I also wondered about the continuity on the show. At the opening game of the second season, "Daniel Jackson" is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole in which he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and he heals his body and restores his uniform as if she had just come down from the closet cupboard. The episode "Hathor" has dropped a sarcophagus into the hands of the SGC, but is never mentioned again. This device could be used in several later episodes to "Daniel", "O'Neill" and "Dr. Frasier '.
