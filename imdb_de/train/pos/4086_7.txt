Impressive. Um ... well ... wow! I think I start with the plot. A betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives at her family home and would be a husband (Mathurin) in France, waiting for the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or another person in the Catholic Church to marry her (to satisfy a will .) Wait, the young Lucy learns of a legend of an animal that roamed the terrain centuries ago. That night she starts in bed dreaming about the beast and his raped consensus with the former lady of the house. It will be interesting there! The plot is really quite thin (and seems to be moving in the middle of the strip for quite a while), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who stick with a shocking and funny finale. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a far-flung movie about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic look at the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it.) Apart from a horse-to-horse action in the beginning, the "deeds" are pretty cartoonish, IMO).
