Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another Disney masterpiece. It was filmed with animation sequences and the actors and actresses interact with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared in sidewalk art.) I rate this film mainly with children's eyes because I have not seen it for years. At that time it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the final scenes (the conflict where the ghostly armor went into battle) were my favorites. There were also a lot of stop animations that were used with the spells (for example, people who turn into rabbits) that are now a bit dated and stupid. (I also think the movie is starting out slowly.) With a child's eyes, this is a funny movie, and it's easy for kids to get into the children's places in the movie. It is an imaginative film that is unfortunately largely forgotten today.
