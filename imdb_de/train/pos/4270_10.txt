Ko tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which one makes you smile every time you see it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is something special. It is Caratherisic for Serbia. And all the former Republic of Yugoslavia knows it very well !!! I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it that way. Because the subtitles ruin the whole thing. But you should try it !!!! Yes, that's ironic! This is the best streak in Serbian history and the world does not understand! :-) If you have a chance to see these, do not blow OK!
