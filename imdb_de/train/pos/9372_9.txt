Red Rock West is one of those rare movies where you guess all the time what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is considered an order killer when he comes to a small town to find work. Dennis Hopper is the evil and no one plays it better. Look for a short appearance by country star Dwight Yoakam. This is usually a serious drama, but there are some brighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
