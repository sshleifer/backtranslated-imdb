It all starts with a series of thefts of seemingly independent objects in a dormitory on Hickory Road, London. Miss Lemon is worried about her sister, who is the housekeeper there, and asks Hercule Poirot to deal with the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes are higher than a girl who admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) thefts was found murdered. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid man brain training without being as complicated as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". Murder, theft and smuggling diamonds are the crimes, and the last twist that holds everything together is only visible in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American Sally Finch. Inspector Japp has his funny moments (in perhaps the next one, which the series calls "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon gets a more substantial part of the story than usual. (***)
