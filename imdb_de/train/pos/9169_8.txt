I liked Timothy Dalton very much, although he was a bit young and too pretty for Mr. R., but I found Zelah Clarke too clumsy and too short. However, this version was very faithful to the novel and filmed very well. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R, though George C Scott did very well and was thrown up between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although both were a bit too old for the role. I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would love to see these two Jane Eyre. When I saw the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I was Jane Eyred, but I'll never tire of the first few minutes when Joan Fontaine tells the opening The first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
