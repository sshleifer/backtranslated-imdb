I am not a parent and not a man. But I could identify with the pain and pain of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie teenagers should watch. Maybe they will appreciate the value of the family again. I'm sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing's. And it's great to see a 19-year-old Ben Affleck doing his best in a moving and honest performance. He showed early on that he is capable of a heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Consider Hollywoodland ... its first serious role in years. He was named best actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe children under the age of 10 should not be watched, as they may be afraid that it might happen to their families, but I often recommend it to friends and family. Because it represents the values ​​that are important in life.
