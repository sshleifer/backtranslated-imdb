Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The last battle between rebellion and empire. The second Death Star is about to finish, and when completed, this will be a fate for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns with Han Solo and Princess Leia of Tatooine, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on Endor Forest Moon while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. They hardly know that they have been given a most sophisticated trap and that the Emperor Palpatine personally oversees the construction of the Second Death Star. The return of the Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, great fighting scenes and great music by John Williams. Mark Hamill has now matured into a Jedi Knight, the naive Farmboy is gone, and in his place is a calm, laid-back Jedi who wants to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play their role in a T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain in the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally reckless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this film are breathtaking and the sword fights are serious and bleak. John Williams score is still cool and upgrades the movie by several levels. <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
