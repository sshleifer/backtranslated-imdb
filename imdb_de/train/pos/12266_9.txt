Imagine, I would miss this great cultural event last night on Swedish television. Just because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV running (so she can fall asleep more easily!), I found it (yes, I had previously seen an ad for it, but of course forgot and was looking forward to an "early night". ..). Anyhow - this must surely be an unusual idea - to found a movie documentary about an interview that was recorded more than 30 years ago with sound. But with animated and other documentary footage, this gives a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most famous literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy alias Hergé. I'm sure I'll read my Tintin albums with a different eye after seeing this movie, which makes it easier to relate the variations in style and content to the different periods in Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I'll get the few that I do not have as soon as possible). Of course, my perception of the albums has changed in the more than 25 years I've read them, as well as my view of which albums are my favorites, but this adds (at least) another dimension.
