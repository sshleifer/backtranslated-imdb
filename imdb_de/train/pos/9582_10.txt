After growing up in the filthy streets of Detroit, MI and having friends traveling to New York's balls, I fell into the lifestyle of being a member of a house. I joined the house of thieves. We adjusted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional crooks who would exacerbate credit card fraud and commit to getting the fabulous jewels and clothing we wanted. I even learned how to make checks and driving licenses and redeem in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service and I went to federal prison. But I have learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you to see it for yourself. You can even read how I grew up in the homes here in Detroit and what criminal activities we took. My book Identity Schemes is available at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's a lot better than Paris Burning, because it's a 2005 brand.
