I saw this movie at the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980 (the English title is "Who sings there?"). It won Raves then ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's awesome, ludicrous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years, and I have only seen a handful of comedies (or other genre) that can match its originality.
