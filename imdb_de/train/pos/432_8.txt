I just looked at it because it was playing Josie Lawrence I Whose Line is It Anyway? Known, the crazy British improvisation comedy show <br /> <br />. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical jewel. It is uplifting, touching and romantic without being juicy or sentimental. The characters are all real people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. Do you see it!
