In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and confused man after losing his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan had trouble discussing his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan withdraws his friendship with Charlie and they come close. Alan tries to repair Charlie's life and sends him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie reacts aggressively to the treatment and is sent to court. "Reign Over Me" is good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the conspiracy; It could be a car accident, a fire, or some other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, who played Alan for the beautiful Saffron Burrows. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler can not be recognized, I do not know if she uses too much make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Pure Sobre Mim" ("Lord of me")
