Of course, I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10 points because my uncle was the lead author of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego has written screenplays living in Italy for over 50 years. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested putting his stories into writing. Rodolfo Sonego did it. If you look at his biography, you can see how many movies were made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the lead actor in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to review the locations for "A Girl in Australia" and to make a great movie about a proxy woman after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I recently found a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
