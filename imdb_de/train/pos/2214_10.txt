My family goes back to New Orleans in the late 1600s of the early 17th century. While watching the film, I knew that this was a story that my grandparents had never spoken, but we knew they were there. I have cousins ​​who are obviously black African Americans and others who "fit" than white can not choose. It is a difficult story when you realize that it's your family, about which they speak, and that Cane River is a part of this story. I want to cry and kick in the ass of my great-grandfathers who owned these plantations, and wonder about how my great-grandmothers of African descent lived under this oppressive and yet aristocratic existence If I had not come out of this story, I probably would not be the successful business woman, I live successfully today in a fairly integrated world. Acting was both excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but it's a movie to do. Anne Rice is unbelievable and I wonder why she's "symbolic" about my family and I do not. I can recommend this movie to anyone. Leza
