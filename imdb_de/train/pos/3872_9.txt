After seeing this cute and funny movie, you will surely feel better. A nod to Yves B. Pelletier for producing this great little movie moment, which I think is recognized as the 2004 Quebec Award Film. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon deliver a touching performance. I would like to compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you with those that have been given to me by Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain. So if you like the great movie Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say you should like the first film by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
