The romantic drama of the working class of director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as it comes, but there are moments of joy that are mainly due to the charisma of the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific). She's a widow who can not go any further, he's illiterate and an inventor in the closet - you can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!) Is so laid-back that it borders on fade, and editing the film is a mess, but still enjoyable. a pink working body fantasy. There are no serious problems (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot tool for the following love story) and not real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are reduced to an interesting level. The finale is pure fluff - and cynics will find it hard to swallow - though these two characters deserve a happy ending and would not satisfy the picture in any other way. *** from ****
