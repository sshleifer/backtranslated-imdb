Wow, that was another good offshoot of the original American pate, not as good as a tape store, but definitely the nude mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler are leading the comedy in this one, but I have preferred the dialogue in this rather bare mile. The script was written much better and the comedy was smoother, but most of the comedy came from sex. But that's okay, because we watch these films anyway, right? <br /> <br /> The Midget Rock also had a really good cameo, given the intense effort he was making on the Naked Mile, his scene with Stifler was great and I had to laugh my ass when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The movie was, in my opinion, a significant improvement compared to the naked mile. If you liked previous American pie movies, you should like Beta House, unless you consider all American pie trash as a waste of money.
