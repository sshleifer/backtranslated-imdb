Halloween is one of those films that goes deep in the skin! It's the scariest movie of all time, in my opinion. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects that showed how the computer is animated. This was possible with a low budget and only one grade, but people managed to fear hell. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as in 1978. <br /> <br /> It is about a boy Michael Myers, who kills his sister at the age of 6 years and many years later escapes the psychiatric institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as "... the pure evil, the blackest eyes, the eyes of the devil". Michael, however, is on a mission to kill his other sister Laurie, who is being played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween while her friends are celebrating and of course we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may have a chance since she's the virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween is a tribute to psycho. We have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely awesome movie that transcends borders and you lock the doors, lock your windows and turn off the lights! "They will get you! They will get you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
