A small, charming little movie, but a great movie. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast around her gathers the dialogue. That came out at the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why he got the Oscar's attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story.
