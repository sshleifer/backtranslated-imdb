When Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slides into the cinemas with little fanfare and mockery, I think of 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" came out. Despite rumors that Kurt Vonnegut is "unfilmable," it's surprising that he has received two great cinematic treatments (the other is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underrated films of the decade and I can not understand why. It is brilliant! It remains almost entirely faithful to the Vonnegut book (without being filtered or overly literary) and adds a purely cinematic poetry. How many films of a work can say that? Vonnegut even enters a cameo at the end of the film. Can you ask for a better confirmation? It's not just a beautiful movie, it's also a beautifully portrayed, written and staged film, and it's one of my favorites among the top five American films of the nineties. It's a sad, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see "Mother Night" - it does not even take any knowledge of Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate them (like "Slaughter-house Five" sometimes). It's a strong, influential piece of cinema.
