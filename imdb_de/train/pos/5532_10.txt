Maybe I'm biased towards foxes, fox stories, and everything, but I thought that would have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed being shown when Lily was not feeling well, like the fire and the room trying not to spoil too much here). I think that's important for kids to see and understand. <br /> <br /> After reading some comments, I am a bit confused. It is said that in the end - spoiler - the mother and her son appear. because it was she who told her son about her story. The movie I saw did NOT have the mother or son at the end, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone enlighten me about it? Anyway, I really liked this movie, even though some scenes may be a bit slow, which is hard for the energetic kids to sit through. It is still worthwhile when they can sit still.
