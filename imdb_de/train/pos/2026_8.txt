I saw this miniseries on British television for the first time a few years ago and was immediately fascinated by the story. That pretty much surprised me because I'm neither Jane Eyre nor Wuthering Heights. I regard the heroine of the former as a self-righteous bore, and the latter work is an oversized clap trap. <br /> <br /> 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall', like the aforementioned works, is a bit depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtakingly wild and beautiful scenery of Yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. This film successfully demonstrates the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny, as evidenced by the treatment of women in the Markham household. At the other end of the scale stands the unfortunate Helen, who is married to a wealthy man of high fortune, but exposed to brutality and humiliation that alternate with long neglect. She runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom, but as women of the mystery living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of inhibited gossip and speculation. <br/> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is as long as she is Helen Markham. Not only is she incredibly beautiful (in spite of this horribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she's also more than capable of playing the central role in the movie. Tara is dignified and reserved, while at the same time revealing that Helen is still dangerously endangered. Rupert Graves is the spoiled but curiously handsome Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could not imagine another actor playing that role. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who played his sister Rose and Simon Carter, the unwelcoming vicar with a penchant for the good things in life. Finally, I could see this movie for Toby Stephens alone; He is so handsome, tough, sexy, sensitive (but not in a foul-smelling way). I'm not even sure he's a good actor because my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If the movie has a flaw, it's the use of flashbacks that I felt had both obstructed the flow of the story and made it a bit confusing. Other people who saw this movie with me also had problems with it, and I had to explain to them that certain scenes were indeed retrospect. <br /> <br /> I am extremely grateful to those responsible for making this film. Not only did I buy the video (a rare event), it also made me buy Anne Bronte's great novel. Of course that was better than the movie, but only with a tight margin. I recommend anyone interested in watching the movie and reading the book in that order. <br /> <br />
