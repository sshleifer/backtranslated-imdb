I really enjoyed it, and although the end made me angry, I still give 10 out of 10 points. Four College Girls (Baltron, Kelly, Steel, and Cadby) Head Down to Florida In their own way, they meet two guys (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to the plot, but at least they're a bit likable. The girls agree to meet the boys in Florida to have fun, but they have problems with the car and never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station to get help, the other three stay by the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, because in the middle of nowhere, there is no choice but to go into the bushes. Soon she witnesses a man (March) strangling a woman, the girl flees in panic from the area, she does not get very far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> Your friends go out in the car looking for them too, they go into the forest and meet the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man answers by shooting the girl's head The other girl runs away and manages to get back to the car where she stands is also killed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the two remaining girls find each other and are arrested for breaking into the gas station. This is when I started to get angry, these poor girls are scared for their lives and the redneck cops do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are treated badly and one of them is left alone so that the madman can kill In the cell the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without going into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene that mimics psycho, graphic violence against women, and a solid history. Some women will probably find it insulting, and sensitive people will NOT like the end, but on the whole, this is a great, unknown movie.
