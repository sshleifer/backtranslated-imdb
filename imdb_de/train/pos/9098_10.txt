Domestic import was a great movie. I laughed the whole time. It was fun on so many levels, from the crazy outfits to the funny situations. The acting was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and all the others have done an excellent job. Since it is an independent film written by a first-person writer, it does not have the clich√©s expected of other comedies. It was unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heartwarming story. I heard that it is based on a true story? If so, that's weird (and unbelievable!). I highly recommend this movie.
