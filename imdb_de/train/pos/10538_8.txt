I work in a film business and therefore I am always looking for an excellent film. I chose Nothing because it was in our Canadian department, and I tried to support my country's film industry. I had a surprise. The film shows David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a hugely entertaining story that seems to immerse so much in our thoughts and relationships ... without working so hard. It is consistently funny by the interaction of the two characters and by some funny exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have cables!"). What else can I say, without realizing that it is worth a try, even if you give it up within the first half hour.
