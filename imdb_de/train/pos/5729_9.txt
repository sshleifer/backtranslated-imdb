This is a bit of a mystery to many artistic Lynch people. They tend to copy this as a kind of pointless, crude side project from Lynch. So Lynch leads gas between his true film art pieces. Well, maybe it's a fart, but it's one of those fascinating fart animals that you notice from a touch of and are embarrassed to admit that you enjoy it. What can one do with aspects of modern life, but laugh about it. If you took it seriously, you would go crazy. You hang yourself, smell it, taste it, feel its torments, its unreasonable stupidity and express it in any medium. This is called art, and art is not stupid. But it is Dumbland.
