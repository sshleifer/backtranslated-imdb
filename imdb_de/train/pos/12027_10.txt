I have seen it and I like that Melissa plays her role well. It was really believable. My brother-in-law saw it with my sister and I, and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot she was based on a true story (I had seen her a few years ago), he said, just because it is true for life and Both my sister and I were as if it were anyway. I wondered if anyone knew what the murder was, or if it was really about who really was involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love Lifetime Movies, especially those that are true, or only those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where help would be asked.
