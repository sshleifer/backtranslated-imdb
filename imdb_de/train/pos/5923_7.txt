A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town and have to deal with a bad teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a pretty girl (girl Amick) and a damned Girls grapple with a big secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, technically this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It is so much fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (with corn) happen, people freak over cat girls, there are bad one-liners, there's too much cheese to handle! <br /> <br /> So yes. You will enjoy it. A lot of. It will not move you, touch you, not scare you or inspire you in any way, but it will entertain and laugh you!
