A great and captivating drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. One outstanding achievement of Stephen Rea, when the forensic scientist led the investigation that finds the biggest obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, especially the old Communist Party members who want to maintain a cohesive society. The film has a fundamental theme about the decline of communist society, and the progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected in the progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly conveyed. There is a conflict between old and new ways, and these are represented by the two views of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea himself. These are initially polarized, with Sutherland 'high' looking down the system and Rea 'low' looking down and up. But you have a common cause? catch the serial killer. Throughout the film, the relationship develops between them, and the tension gradually subsides until Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland respect each other. The murderer is captured and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent screenplay. <br /> <br /> Further accolades go to Sutherland's appearance, which is outstanding and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as a murderer whom we despise but can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who as a humble absolutely convinced psychologist, has his reputation risked to help.
