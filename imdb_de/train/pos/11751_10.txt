Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his former glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his opponent in a rare low-key performance as Jack Dundee. He has dropped the Big Pass in several ways. <br /> <br /> You'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever inserted into a movie as Jack nudges a rat, Reno poses, and the caribou's call goes out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played.
