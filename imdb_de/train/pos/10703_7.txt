This movie is definitely a weird love story. Although this film does not have much to tell, Nicole Kidman wears the movie alone. The rest of the cast could easily be forgotten, though Ben Chaplin with recordings of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead doing a good job for Hertfordshire Life City Center, which represents the true essence of the area. What looks like a regular episode of the popular British TV series "Heartbeat" soon turns into a crappy gangster short film. Nothing special happens in this simple little movie and ends up as a decent weekend entertainment. A good sight, and if you want the hero John to be lonely thirty, you might find something to identify with in his character.
