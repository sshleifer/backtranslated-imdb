Although Stardust is a fantasy movie with a predictable ending and average performances, this is certainly not the case. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has this magical "aura" from the beginning to the end of the film. The plot is well written and keeps you on the seat edge. Like any story, it has some morality. That is why we know in our hearts that the evil brethren do not take the throne, but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty that he encounters on his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is flat and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give Claire Danes additional credits. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that fits in perfectly with her character. Besides, she and Cox have a chemistry that makes the romance in the movie even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses, who of course make Stardust an interesting and high-quality film was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for further awards. I have to award at least 9/10 stars.
