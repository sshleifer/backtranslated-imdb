I am surprised that nobody has ever thought of doing a movie like this. Horror is often most effective when it uses the inconvenience of real life as its theme. And nobody (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Dental torture has been done before (see, for example, The Marathon Man), but that brings terror to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) Madness. Now our dear doctor was not playing with a full deck, but driven by jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he begins to make people around him chaos. The mental health of the doctors is a bit close to what we see in Micheal Douglas' character in Falling Down, but with a horror advantage a great flow. Also playing a cop is always welcome Ken Foree. Now I believe that this film would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. I first saw him in LA Law and was overwhelmed by his acting. <br /> <br /> The sequel The Dentist 2 is also worth seeing, but a bit below average in comparison to the original. <br /> <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - A funny movie with some scenes that will scare you, limited by a great performance by Bernsen
