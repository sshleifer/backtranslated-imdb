Guys and Dolls must be one of my favorite movies. It's a very funny movie and nothing else. It embodies what people have forgotten that musicals were made to entertain, not to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they do not bring us solid entertainment without any restrictions. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very annoying to listen to him when he could not understand him. Without Marlon I would have forgiven these 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offers old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. Take a look at it !!
