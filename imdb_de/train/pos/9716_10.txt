To be able to like this movie at the most, you must a) be deeply in love (without marriage). B) Admire the English humor of admiring brave and funny life situations and not just running jokes to laugh and cry every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements of "b" and "c" You can recognize and enjoy the author's input. d) To fully enjoy the movie, you need to love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) You must admire creative, somewhat melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities. If you meet all of these requirements, you will probably rate this movie near 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never half (!) laughed, as if I have seen this masterpiece. And I even laughed when I laughed in a few moments (I get sensitive every time Kirsten Dunst does something good)
