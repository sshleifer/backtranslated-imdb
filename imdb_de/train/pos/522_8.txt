A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more closely. The film is about what we perceive to be real and what is real and how the two are so difficult to distinguish. Beautifully shot and played, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims. It's fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think while looking at it and afterwards.
