A first director (Bromell) has put together a small but strong cast to contemplate the world of a middle-sized, middle-class, depressive hit and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This movie in less than 90 minutes offers an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman, the 6-year-old son of William H. Macy, is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems to have been written for him as a self-tortured sole trying to break the reins of his father and his business. It is always nice to see Donald Sutherland, and here he is wonderful as the pregnant father of Macy. The film's alternative audio track is worth listening to as the director explains how he chose the cast, the locations, and the movie. The basic Dolby 2-channel sound is sufficient and well-received for this movie. The cinematography creates the mood with a very subtle musical background. Any movie lover or observer of human nature will enjoy it, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
