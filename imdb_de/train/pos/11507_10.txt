I vividly remember the original series, mainly because of its unique blend of dry humor and macabre motives. Kolchak was a hardened newscaster from the Ben-Hecht school for big-city coverage, and his persistent determination and clever behavior made even the most banal episode look predictable. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" due to its totally original story. A poor, restless Cajun youth from the state of Louisiana Bayou participates in a sleep research experiment on the dream analysis. Something is inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams of living a swamp creature that inhabits the dark folktales of his youth. This vicious manifestation seeks out all those who have hurt the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally strangles them to death. Kolchak researches and discovers this terrible truth, much to the chagrin of the police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully written by a grumpy Keenan Wynn) and the head sleep researcher played by Second City improvising founder Severn Darden to droll, understated perfection. The wickedly humorous, shattering finale takes place in the Chicago sewage system and is a series highlight. Kolchak never got better. Timeless.
