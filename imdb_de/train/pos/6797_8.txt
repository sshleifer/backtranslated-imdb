Some bad reviews here and I understand why they are treated as a serious killer movie on a low budget, and you could get more than most. <br /> <br /> I thought this worked in a way because I felt dirty afterwards and wanted to shower for a long time so that there was a certain amount of success, right? <br /> <br /> I would say it's just the right amount of sleaze here to get under the skin, though the acting may be a bit too uneven. David Hess is just in this brielfy, so make yourself up no big hopes if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's worth taking a look.
