Lose as Satire by D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a full-length comedy. The only similarities with intolerance are the opening scene "book" and the fact that similar stories from all eras are put together into a complete movie. Keaton's reason for adopting this style was that, if he was not successful as a feature film, he could be reduced to three double roles. Fortunately, The Three Ages excels in comedy and includes some of the funniest routines I've seen in Keaton's movie. There is nothing unique or bold about the storylines. It's simple boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl plots, but the satire satires are exciting and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all the films in the genre. However, I do not think anyone has ever surpassed this comedy. No one can play the lovable game like Keaton, and the stunts in this movie are some of his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as a rival of Keaton contributes to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks that 1920s comedy can not be appreciated by the modern public needs to see this movie.
