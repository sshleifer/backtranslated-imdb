We showed this film in the local film society, and the audience of the Kunsthaus had the time of their film life. It's tasteless, groovy and very funny in a sort of sixties. In the recipe sketch of Kraft Kitchen, they laughed like madmen. The rest is a mixed bag, but the heights definitely beat the downs. By the way, what happened to Ken Shapiro?
