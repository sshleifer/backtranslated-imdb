This really funny movie has a crazy cast of characters, just about every lush middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. Capomezza's and Malacici's are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at the very end of the taste scale. Her children are represented in the leading roles in a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course they fall in love. On stage! The chaos and confusion that this causes when the parents disagree with each other and their children is carried out for us against the backdrop of the grandiose tasteless Capomezza house and its gloriously tasteless weddings. <br /> <br /> Among the four outstanding parents and enchanting young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a simple-talking grandma, a lady waving a wand and giving spiritual advice she receives from a medium named The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds shaped like the backseat of a car and two pigeons. There's no sight gag or punch line that does not click in this fast-paced movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low brows" and "Malacici" could mean "delayed snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
