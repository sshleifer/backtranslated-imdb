"Arms and the Man" is one of Shaw's funniest pieces, if handled properly, and this production is good enough. Helena Bonham-Carter, star before the movie, is Raina, the daughter of a military family that has a fiancee stake (Patrick Ryecart) and protects a soldier during a raid on the city from the enemy (Pip Torrens). <br /> <br / > Full of color and energy, this production is maturing at a good pace, and when Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit, as maids, are somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the cast, they are still holding ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are adorable, and the whole game is generally a happy one. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
