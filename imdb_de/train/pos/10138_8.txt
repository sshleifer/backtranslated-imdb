Now it is time. I had really given up all hopes that there would be one outstanding episode among the submissions this season. Although there were still too many grim entries, but at least this episode went well. It's pretty funny that director Rob Schmidt, who has just the not bad bad turn, comes to his credit, and John Esposito, whose only filming so far included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, should be the best written and the best The most contemplative episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we learn the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple is having a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff cheating and desperately trying to win her back. As they speak, they end up in a car accident in which Cliff has left only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and set on fire as a spark ignites and gasoline dropped on her sets her on fire plugged. And these are just the setup people. Once at the hospital, Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this condition without skin and only with nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Every time she moves in a row, Abbey walks as a ghost and makes trouble for all sorts of people. Undoubtedly, this is the best episode of the season and is certainly one of the top episodes ever. From the gruesome effects to the straightforward script that brought a few twists that I never saw, and that is so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to live forever.
