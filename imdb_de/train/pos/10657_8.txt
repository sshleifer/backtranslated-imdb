Jeopardy has the feeling of being a kind of stock movie - one of the movies that the studios have pumped out between big budget / box office. It's only 70 minutes and there are not many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star of course. <br /> <br/> Stanwyck is again a tough woman when she finds herself in a kidnapped convict as she seeks help for her captive husband in the Mexican desert. The bulk of the film focuses on how she deals with her conqueror, who is required to submit him in exchange for his help. Some psychological struggles there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it tight and Stanwyck is great, but should not be mentioned (but I'll praise it every time).
