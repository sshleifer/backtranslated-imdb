Those unfamiliar with Cassandra Peterson's alter ego Elvira, this is a good start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine message. It seems that one of her great aunts has died and that she must be present when reading the will. Afraid to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to get a lot of money in the hope. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts. She has to endure a spell because of her car and finds out that her great aunt left her three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The inhabitants of the city have mixed reactions: the teenagers like them, the women hate them, and the men crave them (though they try to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem is her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a spellbook that will make him a more powerful sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The film is actually quite funny, with Peterson aka Elvira using her "endowments" and sexiness as a joke ("And remember, tomorrow we're going to show our head with two things ... I mean the thing two heads "). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works hardest to keep the city in line, but in the end looks ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Worth a look (The movie, of course not her breasts).
