I received a free pass for a preview of this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The premise seemed silly, and I assumed it would be a lot of superficial fun. What a great surprise. I laughed so much that I cried at some jokes. This movie is a must for anyone who is open-minded and has some humor. OK ..... This is not a movie you can go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or little kids. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) rough and the sexual conversation is as graphic as you will not find anywhere else. Amazingly, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is great, but (like The Office), the minority makes the movie really good. All characters have their shortcomings but also depth and sympathy. Everyone is gaining weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be there with Office Space for iterations and quotable lines.
