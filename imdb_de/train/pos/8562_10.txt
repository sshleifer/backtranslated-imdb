I liked it! The plot was funny, Drew Barrymore and DC were both uncomfortable. Drew's acting was dodgy in some places, but perhaps that was because of her past life. Dennis Christopher as a shrinker was pretty cool and as always he does his best - I'm a big fan of Dennis anyway, so I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the end! this strange animatronic red skeleton looked like it was out of film school, which I think is fine, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife - if it was so uncomfortable, why did not you just let it go? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing when it was the weird doppelganger thing or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time? Because the doppelganger went out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick, if it were Dennis as a doppelganger, I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was OK, but intrusive in some places, the whole orchestra composition seemed to be about a theme, but this topic was over the top. <br /> <br /> A great mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of Drew nude. All in all a bit of a GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are plenty of diamond moments and jerks galore - WATCH IT AND HAVE A FUN WITH THEM!
