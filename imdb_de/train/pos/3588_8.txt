When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I've seen a lot of movies about rape, but it's very noticeable. This film has a kind of realism that is very rare in today's films, let alone in television movies. It tells a story that I believe is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today, and I found it very credible (which is hard to find in other rape movies). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were great in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have some harsh reality. I really enjoyed it.
