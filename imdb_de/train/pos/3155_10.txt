I wish "this 70's show" would come back on TV. It was the greatest show ever! You should make episodes between the other episodes, but that would be confusing, of course. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely funny. You can not laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really fun part to each episode, and besides, the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie got along. These were the best consequences. "This 70s show is the best" .... It will and always will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
