I really enjoyed this episode, which was a big surprise given the bad name it seems. From the perspective of writing, "The 16mm Shrine" is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical for Sterling. I especially enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, exploring the issues of existence and reality, and aligning them with psychological issues such as rejection, pride, and desire. "The 16-millimeter shrine" is an episode about how these ideas, which are based on a reluctance to accept change, seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a fantastic example of the cerebral twilight zone; one that explores the mind and not the world outside. These elements all come together very well to create a thought-provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, the episode is not without flaws, which are mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I had the feeling that Lupino was not completely convinced, with only a few scenes that could be considered memorable. Of course, this is an absolute shame, considering how well Sterling has written her character. Besides, Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters. Sometimes they'd been on the set and doing next to nothing - which probably explains why Lupino's poor performances accepted half the time. Fortunately, balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of flaws and solving the show at least from an acting perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said, if you're a fan of classic movie cerebral science fiction, that should not be as bad as it is sometimes meant. Besides the article mentioned above, the episode also contains fantastic photography (I'm still amazed that the show looks so good almost fifty years later!) And a decent set design. All in all, the 16-millimeter shrine is a great episode and certainly one that makes you think.
