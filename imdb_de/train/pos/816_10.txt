First of all, I would say that while I was not a friend of Star Wars, I'm not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat or the extended family of TK427 has. What I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (less in episode 2), have captured something magical. It's hard to say what the button found and braved, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. It's an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I will explain it. star wars touches on the most universal clich√©s, the good and the bad. It does so obviously that every person from every environment can literally understand. Episode VI does this very well and completes the epic battle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but also the prequels complement the hinted back story. Suddenly it's Darth Vader at the front and the crowd realizes it's the story of Anakin, not just Luke. But even before 1-3 there was an amazing depth. it felt real, as if the capsule in Lucas' lap had fallen from the sky and described a historical representation of a distant galaxy. Star Wars is definitely a bit beyond the norm, and I have to admit, whenever I see them, especially those, I feel very small. I feel as if I have come into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I get a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that has touched me a little more than any physical thing could ever hope for.
