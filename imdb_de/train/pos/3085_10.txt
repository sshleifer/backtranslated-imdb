I watched the non-broadcast episodes online and was so sad that the show will not come back. It had the best cast of mature, talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seemed all actors were personal friends in real life. In the end, the show was captivating, sexy and worth watching. Of course, some of the storylines are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all sympathetic and you became them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". A big compliment to all actors. Note for ABC Leaders: Nielsen review reports do not show you true results. The show audience will usually record it. I was very disappointed in big networks that flooded us with reality TV or youth-oriented shows. Why do we get a sophisticated, thoughtful and well-functioning material to switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new stream media are becoming increasingly popular among viewers.
