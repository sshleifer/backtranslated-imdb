I just do not understand why this movie is being beaten up here. Geez It's mindless, it's not polished and for some it's wasted (as I read). The cast of this movie plays its characters until the 'T' (If you've seen Permanent Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller, you'll be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned failures trying to save the city / world with nothing but effort and determination. The problem is that they realize their limits only at the big showdown and that's the point! This is the threefold movie in which the spy that framed me was moved by the same demographic group. It's probably the same people who find the first AP movie pale compared to the sequel. I just do not understand. The jokes work on more than one level. If you did not understand it, I know what level you are.
