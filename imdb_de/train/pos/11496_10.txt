Love this movie too. I saw it when it was shown for the first time in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it had a very ambitious atmosphere. The eroticism of the film hit the audience and the discussion with the producer and director Moritz Boerner was always underlined. In his genre, it was a very ambitious movie, especially if you think it's an independent movie. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of this film, Mortitz Boerner came out of the theater making two or three short films working for television before becoming a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For the people who want to see the movie again, you can find it on their homepage, which is not so easy but it is possible.
