This movie has to be seen. the truest picture of what has happened in the world since Darwin's Nightmare. Look at it! If you are lucky enough to open it in your city, you should see it on the big screen instead of on a DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough to push the ideas through, though barely perfect. Joan Cusack is fantastic and the rest of the cast is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this movie, and I think he needed to spend some of his own money on it. It's a wild, absurd ride that was obviously made without the resources needed but is still successful. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL and even Bill Maher have not shown the courage to say what this movie says.
