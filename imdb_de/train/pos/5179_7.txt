Indian Summer is a warm, multi-character movie that would make a nice afternoon movie (with a bit of cut). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose. This sets the tone perfectly before going to the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is invited back to spend a few weeks vacationing from camp leader Uncle Lou. The film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters, remembering their time in the camp, and creating new memories during their last stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in the great way it produces its characters in this beautiful setting, allowing them to evolve without having to worry about developing the storyline. To see how these people remember, and in their relationships with each other, is what the movie is all about and why it works so well. It is never exaggerated and melodramatic, it always retains warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie that captures nostalgia so well, and I was attracted to myself, even though I'd never been to one of these camps when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic character movie I highly recommend it.
