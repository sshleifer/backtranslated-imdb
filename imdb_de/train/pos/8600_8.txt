I had some concerns about what this movie had to offer. For starters, the casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview did not seem to be a challenge either for him or for the audience. Eva Longoria seemed inappropriate, and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally came to an end, I was not completely unhappy because I had seen a decent thriller that could have been a lot better. Those responsible had taken a little more care to pay attention to the narrative gaps, and paid more attention to character development. We have seen threats of this kind before, and this has made the main conflict much more difficult for the authors. As an audience we do not want to go through the same old story again. We want to see something different, be excited and entertained. <br /> <br /> The casting is wrong. By Kim Basinger's delicious First Lady. She wears enough grace and sexiness to make the part memorable. Michael Douglas has done that before. Unfortunately, the president is a person who does not even care about his fate. Sutherland renews his "24" claim with enough strength to be big enough for the big screen, and Eva is making a decent job as a newcomer. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as many turns and fireworks as some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive") come to mind. Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it may be. It's okay.
