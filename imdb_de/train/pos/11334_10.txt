I would say that this film gives an insight into the trauma a young mind can encounter when a family is split by divorce or other disasters. I can recommend this movie to parents or individuals who want to start a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters from a variety of dimensions appealing and very personable. <br /> <br /> The frightening monster, though it's probably not scary for most adults, has a very real indication of what the overactive image of a child exposed to unknown horrors could produce.
