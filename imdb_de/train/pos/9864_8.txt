I saw "Ice Age" in the movies and liked the movie. Despite the fact that 'Ice Age' has many shortcomings and scientific errors, such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same time, and even the place where the story passes (North America looks like it has some features from Iceland.) For example) we can still have fun (unless you are very strict!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters an ICE ERA, and many animals migrate south to where it is is warmer. Sid is a stupid sloth left behind by his own family who can no longer stand him. When he gets in his way, he meets Manfred or as he calls Manny a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Concerned that he can easily be captured, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey they find a human mother with her baby. The mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and give the baby back to the people. Diego, one of the sabers, chooses to follow and help them make a shortcut to the human's camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego comes from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and pretend they're both cheating on them to become slobbered food. What will happen depends on Diego's behavior and conscience. <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
