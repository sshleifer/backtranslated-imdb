OK - up to the 2 versions of this movie. Two people were involved in the production - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really had nothing to say in the film - only helped with money) - the "Adult" version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not approve or endorse this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd films, the film was not advertised and all the money for "The Right Stuff" was thrown in the hope that the movie would pull it off. SO this movie never really had a chance. When "Twice" reached the cable (HBO), they showed the scrolls with Bill's version, and John threatened to complain if it was shown more (did you notice that the "adult" version did not run very long?). Showtime has received the "clean" version. The version on videotape and the laser disc is the John approved version (which has more power than Bill). It's a pity, because the adult version is actually better and makes more sense. However, it is very doubtful that it will ever be released in this version on DVD (or any other format that is not a bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information because I was the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (there are still many elements of the movie that had a letter version of the adult version that was only stolen) now have a partial HBO Copy of it). 8 stars for the "adult" version - 5 for the "clean" version. All other questions, just ask.
