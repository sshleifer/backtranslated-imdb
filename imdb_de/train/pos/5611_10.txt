I saw this movie at a time when I was shy with the idea of ​​moving into my own home and starting my own life. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I fully believed in the mental humiliation of the poor character in a Paris of eternal construction sites, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I honor Polanski's art in all his direction, his playing and his inescapable script, but during the terrible final scene I fainted and had to be revived by Cognac in the theater's theater office. Fortunately, my life has not been so catastrophic to me (yet), but I have always maintained great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so delve into the (false) reality of mediating. Simply put, man is a genius of first order and a merit of humanity. This film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. Since some performances were in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most of the other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, if you are bilingual, I warmly recommend the sound switch from French to English and vice versa while displaying the appropriate scenes while watching the great transmission on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "Apartment Building Trilogy", which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" in Region 1 has not yet made it to a decent DVD broadcast. The three films would of course be a great boxing set.
