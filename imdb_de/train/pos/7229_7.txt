The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual chases as Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that he can disappear. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a girl changing room or something else, he uses his newly discovered invisibility to torture Tom. And it's pretty funny and quite imaginative, even if it's a funny cartoon. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the property of below-average T & J shorts. Still worth a 7/10. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall, it defies the physics and nature of the invisible itself.
