Am I the only one who has seen the connection between the discussion of the myth of Sisyphus and the life of Mary? In the camus version, a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a huge boulder he has to roll up a hill. Unfortunately, the boulder slides up each time, landing at the bottom for it to start. Maybe a buzzard has pecked his eyes, I'm not sure right now. In the film, Mary spends her life bringing her life together, unfortunately she falls every time she sits up and loses everything. An example would be the party she throws, where she is intoxicated, insulted her falafel lover and practically attacked by liev screamers. If you question this theory, notice how this scene ends with trying to climb a star flight, while books fall out of thin air and obstruct their progress until it finally faints. The next morning when she awakes, she is still on the stairs and has never reached the top.
