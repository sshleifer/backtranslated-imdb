I really think that this movie is more of an example of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the movie is very good in many ways and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but that's the genre. The film has a noir atmosphere that revolves around a femme fatale. Just like the old Noir classics, here's a script that will twist you so that you do not always know how to understand it. If you think too deeply and try, it can be stretching Put all the pieces together. That's the genre. In general, the script offers enough surprises and twists to let the viewer guess and be surprised again without giving up the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks great and she speaks with her double-voiced dialogue so that she zhuzh something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than passable, because we see the face it - you have to interest an audience for, "Does she or not?" Question for two hours. In addition to a twisty script and an entertaining performance by Stone, this is effectively accomplished through the creation of a noir atmosphere that is both dark and very crisp and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines blended with those of Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - push the pauses everywhere and there is something interesting for the eye. <br /> <br /> The film also builds effectively on things that were gimmicks in the first movie, and makes them a bit more realistic especially about sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... shocking!" is treated more objectively here, and usually the sexuality of the film is better used. It's still exciting, but not so easy for the shock and humming as in the first one. I will not say that it is not always a game, because this movie should be fun. <br /> <br /> And it's a funny movie. It may be an easy target, but if you pay attention to what it is: a Noirish, Femme-Fatale-Powered, Twisty, Sexy, Have-you-or-not-you-who-idiot, you're sure to rejoice (no pun intended).
