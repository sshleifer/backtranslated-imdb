King of Masks is a shockingly beautiful and deeply moving film. The 16-award-winning film is based on a true story and focuses on Wang Bianlian, a street artist in 1930s China who, though older, has no heir to pass on his art of face-changing opera. He has a unique talent for quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing for a grandson because his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go out on the street and see people selling their kids because they can not afford to take care of them. Some even beg to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian continues from there. <br /> <br /> The movie was so amazingly good, the acting was amazing and the topics were so difficult and well spoken. There is gender inequality and the oppressive fact that nobody wants a little girl at this time and place. Interestingly, the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who disguises himself as a woman, and although he is famous and respected, he considers himself a lowly woman. Later in the film, the issues of the human slave trade and its demand, and thus the lack of a possible solution, the brutality and corruption of the military and police as well as the helplessness and lack of power that each individual can face, face the unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another nice performance.
