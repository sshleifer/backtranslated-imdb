This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The footage is extraordinary and sometimes fascinating. It also received an Oscar for the best photography, and rightly so. I have a lot of films in my film collection and several that I have seen, and not many of them are more beautiful or even as well made as this one. <br /> <br /> It's unique and overall great movie. The cast is great and does a great job of portraying their characters. We follow her fate with dedication and are very emotionally attached to her. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot of this movie is about what it represents and how it presents it. I highly recommend it
