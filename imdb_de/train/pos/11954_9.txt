Great movie, enough laugh and action for every audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted in this movie, it's up to me to call Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the movie, here I am. <Br /> <br /> The film follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, as they follow a hint given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their search leads them to the homeland of the murderer and finally to a tragic end. But do not be fooled by the plot, the movie is really weird and the acting is outstanding. <br /> <br /> It seems that directors are reaching a certain age, that they are really doing everything right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to do one of the most imaginative works of their respective careers. If you watch the movie in a pact theater, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready to make a comeback. The second he ran on the screen became light. There is only something about the man and he really shines in scoop. <br /> <br /> Try it, it's worth the trip.
