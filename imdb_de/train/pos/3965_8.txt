The movie as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is honored as Chip Hardesty, with well-done co-star twists by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. The film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly reviewed and closely scrutinized and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover for script approval and all aspects of the film, including clothing. Not that J. Edgar Hoover was proud of anything. His leadership of the office from 1924 until his death was among the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover was worried that he was being forced out, and he had already started collecting dossiers on powerful people to protect and protect his small kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no film showed only a single wart across the office. The films only show continuing successes and complaints about the failures that have occurred and the role of the office in the witch hunt of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with your tongue stuck in the cheek.
