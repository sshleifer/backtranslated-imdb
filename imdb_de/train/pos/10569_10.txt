Footlight Parade is smart, rude, funny, fast, sexy, extravagant, dark, erotic, intrusive and trite. A first class entertainment, what the movies are about The treatment gives the material a fresh note and its tempo and the lines are breathtaking. To think that only seven years ago did they start shooting pictures that involved talking! Today, the brilliance of the dialogue can nowhere be achieved, especially as "realism" has taken over and devoured contemporary cinema. The film was shot at a time when the Hayes code limiting the content was ignored. The result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and living cinema that spoke directly to the contemporary audience through depression and general fears of the age suffers. I would recommend watching every movie from this period (1930-1935) to get an idea of ​​what popular cinema can be like.
