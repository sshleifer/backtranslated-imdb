If you're as big a fan of an author as I am of Jim Thompson, it can be pretty dubious if their works are turned into film. This is not the case with Scott Foley's depiction of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. An exciting, sexually charged Noir classic that follows the original text very well. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward may give the best performances of their careers. And the ever-phenomenal Bruce Dern would have even outdone himself with this. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world in which passion overcomes logic and the double-cross is never far away. A must for all fans of the great Noir movie. **** !!!
