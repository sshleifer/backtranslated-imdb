For beginners I did not even know anything about this show for a year or so because of the internet. I've never seen it on TV in my country before, and many people usually do not know about the show. It's a pity, because this is by far the most original and clever animation that I've experienced in years. <br /> <br /> I do not spend much 10 points, but this is a show that really deserves 10 points. While this may seem like a typical cartoon at first glance, keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the whole story unfolds, you know that this is a really deep story with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spirit animals, an ancient Indian belief that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist that you will not often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is something completely different. Sometimes it's a little bit like Spawn in terms of pithy design, and sometimes it takes a more boxy approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, has been animating a segment on the show (since he also drew this segment in comics). Show that different topics like reality, suicide, spirituality, life are taken up then you should not miss this. As soon as you start looking, you will probably see it to the end. A minor fact may be that the show takes less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question is, where is the DVD?
