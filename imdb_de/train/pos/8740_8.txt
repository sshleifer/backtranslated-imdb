A bug's life is very detailed. Everything is covered. The movie looks good and the animation is sometimes awesome. The film is not too terribly original, it is basically a modern version of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, with only flaws. However, I enjoyed the character interaction and the bad guys in this movie seemed to be really bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys cut through copies. The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead actor, was a brilliant creation. Check this out.
