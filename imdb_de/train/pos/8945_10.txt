This is an honest attempt to make a lovely sweet love story. The obvious inspiration for the successful TV series "Bewitched" is this beautiful sweet Rom-Com a timeless treasure. The comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays an unfortunate but solid "straight". Kim Novac plays a luscious blond witch who catches him with a love spell. However, when this spell is broken by a stronger witch, she settles for the task of running her own shop, and consoles herself with caring for her beloved Pyewacket (her feline family) from her beloved aunt. They recognize the aunt at "Murder by Death". This movie is fun and touchingly sweet, it has a spectacular wit and a nice witch feeling. Worth a look.
