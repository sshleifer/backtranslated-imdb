David Lynch's new short film is a very "Lynchian" tune, full of darkness, suspense, silence, discrete but very textured background music. Again, two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, are the focus of his work. <Br /> <br /> Both characters create a very intriguing relationship between slave and mistress that can be considered as a direct result of the same kind of relationship that existed in Mulholland. <br /> <br /> Beautiful happens. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
