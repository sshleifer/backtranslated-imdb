Certain elements of this film are of course dated. For example, a completely white men's team. And like most Pre-Star Wars science fiction, it often takes too long to admire oneself. <br /> <br /> Still, no film has captured the taste of Golden Age science fiction like this, though it was not so good at using the "electronic tonalities" to provide the music notes. Robbie the Robot embodied the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. The plot line is of course Shakespeare's "The Tempest". Morbius is an exiled Prospero and wizard who finds his kingdom conquered by invaders ... It was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
