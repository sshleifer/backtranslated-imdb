If you were born around the time this film was done, and had a liberal / open-minded household that I had, I'm sure you would find out in the early '80s the first time your parents saw dirty movies see or extremely dirty are films. You know, not 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemistic mix of current drama and pornography, or that you would sneak into their collection and plunge into the plastic rectangle of such a movie in a big Dookie machine called VHS. They had to be very quiet and ninja-like, but they still had a mild heart failure when pressing pop-like buttons for fear of discovery made huge pop sounds. However, such films were sent to the back of the mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such a visual "art". Needless to say, this movie fits the above description into a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexuality of the film, but perhaps I am disturbed by the desensitization of my feelings through the intricacies. Did the Creator speak to us at deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be true abominations, interracial relationships, bed-feeling, voyeurism or despair over social status, including murder, pedophilia / homosexuality or the repressed sexual nature of socially elitist women in 18th century France? Who can say, but although Mr. Borowcyzk has a desire for vivid, raw sexuality as the "norm" for his work, I would say that this film actually speaks to the viewer at a deeper level in terms of bestial carnality. Once I've learned that, the story became much more interesting beyond the dizziness of shock, so it's worth checking.
