This is a direct video movie, so it should go without saying that it will not compete with the first Lion King, but that was really good. <br /> <br /> My kids loved that, but that's a matter of course, they love everything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that * I * liked it too, it was funny in some places (even the fart jokes *) funny, had a lot of creative connections to the first movie and even some jokes that you had to make to be older, to understand it (without being risky like in Shrek ["do you think he compensates something?"]). <br /> <br /> A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised that none of them found out The jokes were just toilet noise (in fact, there were almost no sounds / pictures, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup / punchline / etc and were almost in good taste. I want my kids to think that humor is more than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in that respect. <br /> <br /> Hmm, what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second film, but a lot of fun for the kids. No painfully trite moments, which was a blessing for me. A bit of action, but not too scary (the secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure if a G rating was appropriate for this category ...) <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this is a great thing a movie for children of all ages who are 100% sure to watch them (I try not to be overly sensitive, but I had to jump up and turn off the TV during some movies that are less child-friendly were as expected) - but you can leave the room during this time. I would say, stay with it anyway, you may find it great :)
