This is the second Baby Burlesk short film to be released, and probably the best known. He is a parody of the 1926 silent movie What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I have seen this and do not understand the child pornography that is claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I saw family shows that I saw in the 80s and 90s where little girls were provocatively dressed and behaving "mature". It was more provocative because they were NOT dressed in diapers. A diaper is not provocative, unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) I've read this description of the movie, and it states that only a pedophile would enjoy it. That is sick. For me, if you see this and bother about it, you may need to examine your own psyche and find out why it bothers you. It's an innocent movie made as a parody of another movie. All B.B. films were parodies, nothing more. The parodies / parodies of today are graphic in nature and have real, almost pornographic scenes and a pretty mean language. Should not that be more terrible? I can observe them without any problems, but sometimes they take children's stories with them and turn them into parodies. That should get under your skin. Not that she chatted an adult movie from 1926 (not a word, I know) because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC these silent films were, right? Not to mention those "forbidden Hollywood pre-code era movies" that are so disgusting and dirty. You would NEVER do such a mess today? (note the sarcasm)
