Modern viewers know this little film mainly as a model for the remake "The Money Pit". Older viewers see it today with nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a lighter, less complicated era. Or was it? Of course, time has a chance to change perspectives, and with so many films today stunted with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder at controversies in older, seemingly less provocative films. There may be more in "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house" than the public sought in 1948. There are political comments, however subtle they may be. Finding a house in the late 1940's was a true, annoying experience, tempered only by the arrival of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The Blandings children always seem to be talking about the progressive ideas they are taught in school (which in real life would lead to the accusation of teachers of communism). Even in real life, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, democrat and feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a democratic fire brigade brand: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom the young Richard Nixon accused of violating communism (and ruining it). Jason Robards, sr., Plays a minor role in the film, but his political activism was no less conspicuous. More importantly, his son Jason Robards jr. For many years a very active liberal Democrat was. Almost the weird guy was Cary Grant, whose strict conservatism reflected an already declining political majority in Hollywood. However, this was 1948: Communism was a real threat, and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would take another decade for political activism to reappear in the mainstream films, and then not so subtly.
