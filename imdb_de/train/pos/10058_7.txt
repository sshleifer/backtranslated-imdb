I admit that I've gotten over the film genre of a small child that softens the heart of his reluctant guardian. I have seen enough of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent Whale Rider? to expect to be bored by the formula. What kept me in "The King of the Masks" was the cruelty of the area: China's small town in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girls' children were so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or whomever would put them on the black market. When Wang discovers that his purchased grandson, whom he calls "Doggie," is a granddaughter, he initially throws her out, although she is promising as an heir to the street. Even after reluctantly taking her back, he is not upset when she is kidnapped. The film is then coarse-grained and shows the lengths that a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two main ideas are believable and beguiling in their social context. In a Western society, Wang would at least expect a hint of resentment if he had not achieved any more material success. However, Wang accepted his position as a celebrated artist of low social status so thoroughly that I did. While Doggie has a degree of sophistication and cunning that suggests a modern, suburban kid, it's perfectly believable in the context of a child who is constantly in survival mode, in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners physically and mentally abused her, her passionate attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> The view of the small town life in a foreign country leads the naturalness of the two actors, the surprising twists of the action and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very predictable film.
