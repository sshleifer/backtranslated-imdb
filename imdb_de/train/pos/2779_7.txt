"Bend It Like Beckham" does not mean much to us Americans, who know very little about the other football, but for English sports fans it's "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan". Every young footballer dreams of turning a football around a player and putting him in the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham, much like young Indian Jess (Parminder Nagra) in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play soccer games that are banned by her traditionalist mother. As she plays one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling football team of all girls. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother disapproves of. The film is not about not obeying parents, but more about a girl who does what she wants, even if it's against culture, not just parents. There is humor throughout the film, especially when Jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film uses a clich√© moment, as the big football game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it does not sound cheesy, it's fun and easy. The football action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of football will thrill some spectators. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, it's about a girl who's trying to find herself and please her parents, something that turns out to be rather difficult.
