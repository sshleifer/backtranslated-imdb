I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in 1994, and I've just recently watched it and it's still funny. I do not know if you need to understand hip hop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 1990s, with NWA and Public Enemy at the top, there were internal conflicts within the groups and members when their paths split (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also Wanna b's, accessible rappers starting the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams of C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie makes fun of all this, as if it were indeed a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spent a year in the life of a fictional rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B. Scott / Revenge of the Nerds) and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an aspiring rap group whose politics make them controversial. What's good about this movie is that it's so thought-through in its portrayal of the 80's hip-hop industry, and it's fun to play with, but if you know the 80's / 90's rap, you know how much of that stuff true is. Still, without hip-hop knowledge, it's still a funny, funny movie and for those who ask, yes, it was Spinal Tap, but Spinal Tap is not the first parody movie, in my opinion equally funny and in a way also better than Spinal Tap. Since Spinal Tap is too heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is rapping. And the songs are also off the hook. The DVD is full of extras that include music videos by NWH as a group and as a solo artist, brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
