This is an above average silent movie and it is still worth a visit if you are a fan of the Silents. However, if you're not a fan of the genre, you should try a few other movies before you watch them. That's because the plot looks pretty old-fashioned and hard to believe in spots. Still, it is still a good movie and has sparked my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a nice lady connected with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The movie starts five years later, after realizing that he's really a brutal thief. Still, she tries to make the most of it and not think about how good life was before that jolt came to her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich woman whose husband is trying to complete a deal. Unfortunately, the lady with whom they have tried to win a potential customer for a dinner party can not make it, and the seamstress is well paid to be the date of the man. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is in love with her! What to do now - assuming that she is actually married and the new guy wants to marry her ?! Watch the movie for yourself to see how everything is solved. I did not like the way they handled the husband because it seemed very predictable and clich√©d. As soon as he's out of the way, however, I admire that the movie has not given up any finale ending in the numbers and left the film with a few loose ends. All in all, a very good movie that is worth seeing, but certainly not great.
