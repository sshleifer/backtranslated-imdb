The odd couple is a comic book gem. One of the funniest screenplays ever dedicated to celluloid - surpassed only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: the compulsive Felix and the sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he can not live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix 'wife leaves him at the beginning of the film and moves after an aborted suicide attempt at poker buddy Oscar. That's when the fun starts. <br /> <br /> The whole script is brilliant and full of brilliant one-liners. You probably know the "F.U." Joke, but it still works great, thanks to Matthaus comic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clean his sinuses in the diner, and when the Pigeon sisters are charmed by a very lovely Matthau and Lemmon totally out of his element. This requires repeated visits!
