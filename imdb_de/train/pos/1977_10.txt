I really love this movie. I remember once being shown in Grade 2 by my teacher on a 16mm film roll. However, this film can be a bit scary for second graders, as in the scene where Bill Nancy murders and faces Fagin's face on the screen for the first time. One of my relatives is sick of watching this movie because she studied it in music lessons. If I was a teacher and could rate the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them an A +.
