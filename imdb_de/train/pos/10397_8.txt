The emergence of the thief of Baghdad is a story in itself, almost as miraculous as the story told in this film. Alexander Korda almost went bankrupt when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> According to the Citadel series Book on The Great British Films, the adopted son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda, conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years planning and preparing it. Unfortunately, World War II caught up with Korda and the rising costs of filming a big spectacle. <br /> <br /> Budget costs also appear in US films, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand after 1932 at Paramount he returned there. But DeMille or his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs during the shoot. Part of the way through the shootings, Korda brought the entire company to America and filmed these sequences with Rex Ingram as a genius in our Grand Canyon. In the UK he would certainly not get such a landscape. Korda has also completed the interior design in Hollywood, just in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940. <br /> <br /> The spectacle of The Thief Of Baghdad brought four Oscar nominations and three Oscars for Best Color Camera, Best Art & set direction for a color film and best special effects. Only the original music by Miklos Rosza did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda really must have been happy about the decision to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from this location. <br /> <br /> The special effects, however, do not overwhelm the simple story of the good that triumphs over evil. The good thing is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez, and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the magician who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both of which belong to Duprez. This was Veidts career to Casablanca, where he played the Luftwaffe Major Str√∂ker. <br /> <br /> Of course, good things get a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu, who could well have been one of the few who have called themselves at this time as an international movie star. He literally grew out of poverty and worked as an elephant stable boy for the maharaja of Mysore. He was discovered by Alexander Korda, who needed a local leader for a jungle face. Sabu captures all the innocence and villainy of youth as he fulfills the boy's Arabian night fantasy that plunges a tyrant. This is not bad news that should be sent in 1940. The thief of Baghdad is doing remarkably well today. It's an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order.
