I really like what I've seen so far from this cartoon. Sure, the animation is not the best, but honestly, I'd rather see this kind of cartoony style run faster and cheaper than the old style (which has happened more often). it's just a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is invested. There is nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black eyes - I think it's really cute. As a kid, I never thought Scooby-Doo's design was so adorable, but I think I could know better. Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and I believe it or not, but I think he has the most potential for some depth. Sure, the show is not about the original mystery-solving theme, but that was just a tired old formula anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers who are capable of much more interest in the traditional activities of Mystery Inc. (which was too late), but in the meantime this is the show case is a funny departure from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but not just as a comic relief. They are still cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use seemingly (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old, overblown idlers as ever, but now they seem to live with the help of Uncle Albert's inheritance. <br /> <br /> I found the most original Scooby Doo jokes to be pure cheese and, at best, unintentionally hilarious, but this show actually has the ability to be true humor. Besides, I never like Casey Kasem as a shaggy anyway, so the new actor does not annoy me as much as other people. (I still think Billy West was the best.) <br /> <br /> All in all, though he's not a great cartoon for the entire cartoon story, he's still an accomplishment among other Scooby incarnations.
