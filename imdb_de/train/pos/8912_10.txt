I've read many comments on this site that criticize The Blob for being cheesy or camping. The film was criticized for amateurish acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose sole experience is the production of locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell these overly critical reviewers that this movie has never taken itself so seriously. This fact should be apparent from the inappropriate theme music with stupid lyrics played over the opening credits. For what it should be, this movie is excellent. I have seen some of the recent trials on an extremely low budget. Blair Witch Project was one of them who had absolutely no entertainment value and no intelligent thought behind their plan. BWP was pure feces. The blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written, and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man bumps into the meteorites and pushes the mass inside with a stick was brilliant and really scary. The scene in the doctor's office, where the blob slowly moved under the gurney's blanket while he ate the old man, was a cinematic horror masterpiece. The bottom line is that I love this movie. I challenge everyone to raise $ 120,000 for today's dollar value and make a movie as entertaining and as successful as the blob. That simply does not work. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
