Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) trying to destroy Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to rescue them. "Doctor Mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy fare that offers plenty of action The plot is pretty dumb and the gore is totally missing, but the movie is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill, give it a look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
