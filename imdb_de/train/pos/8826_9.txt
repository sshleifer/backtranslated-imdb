If you are amused by straightforward operations that are logical in a certain illogical situation, you will enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small caf√©. The scene looks normal, but the adversary, the clients, and the two musicians seem strangely muted. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the musicians play, and a man sings the theme song and dances with musical comedy on the tabletop gestures. The customers, who were immobile at first and intermittently (poorly but informally) with phrases from the song, read from notes in their palms. They jump up and down and dance (awkwardly, but seriously) in choreographed movements like backup singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman wonders The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's on his chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you're (probably ironic ) Do not catch the lyrics of the song, The situation-appropriate performances should make you smile and giggle ... I would like to see it again!
