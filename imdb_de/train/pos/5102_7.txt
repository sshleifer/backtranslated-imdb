The soundtrack, which is now playing, does not matter. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Debra Winger is always interesting, and although this was an earlier role for her, she is pretty good side of the tracks as Cissy, a girl out of the wrong, lived in the trailer with Bud, (Travolta ), only to be replaced by Madolyn Smith as a rival for a while. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review on Scott Glenn's only used for plots that are inserted into the mix to create tension; The story is predictable and invented. <br /> <br /> Even though I came from the East, many of us did NOT like "Saturday Night Fever," even though it had its moments and the eternal stereotypes are uncritical that point. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Debra Winger; She is still so sympathetic and has never had the Hollywood personality to whom we are exposed to too many actresses today. 10.7
