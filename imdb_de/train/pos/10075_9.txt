"Masks" is a moving movie that works on many levels. In the simplest case, it is the haunting story of a street artist who associates with a young child as he tries to pass on his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although history sometimes turns the old man into a job, he is so well-crafted (written, traded, directed, and wonderful in production), but it's easy to go beyond his plight. And if you hang on, the movie is ultimately very cute and uplifting. Kudos everywhere. This is a wonderful movie for kids and adults. The trick is how to make Americans who do not like foreign language films get to see it!
