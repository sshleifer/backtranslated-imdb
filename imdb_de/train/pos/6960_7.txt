A guy desperately looking for action tries to hit a pretty girl in a bus. She refuses, but as he runs after someone trying to steal their purse, they still come together. And there it starts - a relationship that is a little stained by the fact that she's a jealous and neurotic superheroine. It can not be a secret that things become problematic between them. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that promises to become a cool movie. And IMO manages to be a beautiful movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I had laughed more than once when I laughed - the two main characters are spinning around in a crazy love affair that is believable even with the superhero thing. > So. Thin story, but really funny and therefore worthy of the cinema time. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 broken hearts
