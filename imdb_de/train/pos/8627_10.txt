My God ! Buttgereits masterpiece is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this film is really disturbing but not cruel than the necromancers. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the directing is completely inventive despite the shortage of money (see the "bridge" sketch). We recommend!
