I love this movie a lot, I've watched it over and over again. I do not understand why anyone would think that this movie was not good. Maybe you have seen better, or whatever it is, I personally love it. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not a Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I did not see that and I do not think it's any better than that. I do not know why you're all struggling with it, but maybe you have a good reason, but I do Guess I said it enough, but I absolutely love watching this movie and what movies do you like? Everyone else I looked at enjoyed it, and I'm surprised that many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how she writes her last name), she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
