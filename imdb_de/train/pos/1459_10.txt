Impressive! Impressive! Impressive! I've never seen a non-preaching documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has no narrative and combines real footage with sensitive interviews with four youth workers in China who live in a factory site. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. However, most of her days and nights are work, work and work - but the footage of her work is bright and mesmerizing. The owner of the factory in China is surprisingly open, so much so that he is impacted by globalization while "punishing" the workers. Following carnival beads from China to the carnival, the film shows how the local people are connected to the world through humor and interesting, captivating shots from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts in this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and carnival revelers through images. Here the film closes and shows how images can become a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preaching, is not guilty and lets everyone's point of view be represented. At the end we - the audience - make our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.
