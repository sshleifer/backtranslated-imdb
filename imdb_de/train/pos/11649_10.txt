What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you will not regret, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth wears the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing else but him, I liked the movie anyway. The music of A.R.Rehman takes time to grow with you, but after listening to it a few times, you really like it.
