Reportedy is based on actual historical events. This troubling violent, bloody and shocking epic lends the viewer interest by creating a likelihood that is absent in most movies from a remote time. Ms. Bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a show of strength. Her gradual transformation of the character from an obedient, if not willing, complicit in social injustices of her time is accurately demonstrated by narration of sequences: her witness to the hateful local Duke rape activity, her forbidden love affair with a Jew, her criminal renunciation of the invading Muslim forces of Sensuous Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) There are some painfully realistic bloody sequences (human peeling) in this film that are not intended for the squeamish, but spectators with strong stomachs and interest in medieval history should find much interest. It deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to Hollywood's depictions of the medieval world.
