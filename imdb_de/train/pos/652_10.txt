This film is so complex that it can be described arbitrarily and still play along. They have an insecure, restless and intriguing protagonist (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) trapped between two (no, three) women. We hear his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see him surround his three magical women whom he loves. This could be the premise for a poultry movie filled with stiff, cold, uninteresting comments. However, director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and funny. Since it's such a long movie, it's imperative to laugh when Jean-Pierre Léaud, after two hours of polite speech, suddenly shouts on the phone while recalling a cheesy line from a movie. These situations are purely cinematic and can not be completely restored in a commentary. nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue by Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the film. 3 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
