Jeff Wincott is not just a hunk, he can kick his butt! This movie has some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Ok, maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I hired for a reckless politician, she did a great job anyway! And do not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert / stunt girl Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, Who CARES ?! She is just as good, if not better! (Just look at their fight scene at the end of the film, a word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you are really missing out on a great martial arts action.
