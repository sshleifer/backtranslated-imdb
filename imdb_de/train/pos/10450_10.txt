It was a coincidence that I searched the TV channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful people who are attracted to each other in a very innocent and virginal rapport. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This girl and guy warms your heart and soul and lets you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really wish you had been with a man or a guy you loved and lost in the depths over the years, pursued to your heart's content. Jesse and Celine have great conversations and deep eye contact with a big magnetic explosion between the two. I'm looking forward to seeing SEQUEL for this movie in 2004, and once you've watched this movie, you'll feel the same way.
