I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I just happened to see this show in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working in the finance industry overseas in London for a change. I loved Rolf in that role and every other role he played in. I can not believe that the series lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in New York City, it was always late at night or during closing times. The show lasts less than an hour. I felt like this show should have been longer, but the casting changes in the second season made the show a little less interesting. I was not interested in Sylvia, but missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane last season. I felt that the show took a risk and often worked. It showed Americans who loved it and wanted to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the occupation instead of making them all British. I liked to see Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt like this show should have been longer. I sometimes had the feeling that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have relocated the cast to New York City, and that would have been a hit in America.
