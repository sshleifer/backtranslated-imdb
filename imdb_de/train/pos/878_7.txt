Interesting characters, a lot of excitement. So close to black and white, without being black and white. I was averse to the casualness of the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, almost deaf secretary, who could turn to crime, ruin colleagues, cheer people up in their own way, and finally take part in a robbery and bring someone over to be a bait for your own getaway. The trend towards high-quality films that sympathetically portrays criminals is a bit daunting, without responding to the injuries they have done to others, rather than calling their immediate opponents idiots. In this movie, we never know who they really live with money, or the innocent woman the sympathetic Deaf Secretary uses to build the shabby bar owner to save the lost loot. Too bad, the movie could have been great.
