The big problem is where to start, as this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and you should not miss any time to get a Coke as there is a danger that you can not follow. But fine, there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to go on a journey through time to find out if a virus is a virus that caused animals to rule the world in 1996. It lands with some mistakes only in 1990, then in World War I and how messed up these are. Terry Gilliam has one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows just how ingenious SF stories must be told, and his choice of cast could not have been better. There is the crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and an outstanding Bruce Willis who proves he is more than any Schwarzenegger. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again, as the script is so funny and complicated (and yet you can follow it) that every view offers different surprises. One of my big favorites.
