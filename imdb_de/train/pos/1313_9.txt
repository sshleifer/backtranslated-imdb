More TV movies should be made like this. I saw it in 1993, when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both great and gave very crisp and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good and made an exceptionally scary and inconspicuous performance as child molester / murderer. This movie really raised my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow formulaic and exciting. But the direction in both works has the same austere, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that are unpredictable and overreacted, you should check it out. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also appealing without affecting the main story.
