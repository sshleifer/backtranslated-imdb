I saw this movie on Turner yesterday, and I could not stop until it was over, though I somehow knew what would happen. Farrell was great in her role and everyone else did a great job. Some of them seemed to cross the line, but all in all, I loved it !! If you get the chance to see it, please do it! I actually cried at some scenes, but I think if you're a mom, you would do that. Loretta is beautiful and I was amazed at the idea that they are unmarried mothers ahead of their time. I say, WATCH IT, if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I really enjoyed it!
