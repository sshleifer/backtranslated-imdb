According to the critics and the audience BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big, fat clinker. But because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to do it last night. It turned out to be well worth seeing. Sure, it's not a basic American comedy, and it's not a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from the other films, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were some storylines, but overall it worked. First of all, Kidman was again fabulous in a very different, not very glamorous, but still pretty sexy role. She proves again and again that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood. Her Russian accent is not only good when she speaks English, but there are times when she has long conversations in Russian, and if you do not know that it is Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have noted in "K-19". Overall, a small movie that works despite the terrible humming.
