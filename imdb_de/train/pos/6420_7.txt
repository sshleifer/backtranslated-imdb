This is a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to form a powerful and influential film. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he encountered in obtaining certification from a racist master diver. Along the way, he also has to face the simple old fanatics of his classmates, none of whom wants him in his class. They come out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he is certified and makes a great career as a US Navy diver. Look at that! It's a great story of courage and honor. As history unfolds, we can watch racism slowly dissolve and everyone begins to respect men one after another.
