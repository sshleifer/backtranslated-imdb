Does anyone know where this movie was filmed? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. The apartment building of Ivy certainly looks like the Brill Building with its fascinating elevators. Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Maybe he was the husband's lawyer, but I do not remember that character in the movie except that he was mentioned as having made a call. Maybe he was in the aviation scene? Or the ballroom scene? Has anyone discovered him? Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he made this film.
