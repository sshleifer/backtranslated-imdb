Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the horror movie of 2001, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well played, sent, etc. Everything was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), totally horrible and scary (Paige's death) and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the whole cast has done a great job, especially the three main characters: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and get autographed during the filming - VERY nice people!) And Marley Shelton. <br /> I'm tired of people calling this movie "another scream clone". This movie is by no means a scream clone. In fact, this movie is around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Scream was NOT the only movie in which a masked killer was seen. Sorry, but it looks like Scream was also a clone (um ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies with mask killers). I also think that the novelty of the Amor-Masker-Killer is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet Cupid face doing all those horrible things. Another novelty (nose bleeds) makes room for a fantastic ending! The end gives me a shiver every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you did not like it the first time, look again at Valentine and give him another chance! ! Soon...
