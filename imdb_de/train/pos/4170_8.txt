I've seen this movie more than once. It was like a lot of the creepy things that were shown in television movies back then. The only problem I had was for obvious reasons titled ... Immediately think of Drake's famous snack pie! Without the first part, "Hound of Hell" would have been enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always manages to convey something serious about everything he does - whether the act is good or bad. However, this was a gratifying Halloween fare from the CBS network. I loved the part in which Crenna takes a flight to a dark land to find the mystic who would help him defeat the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how he can find this guy. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna regarding the attitude of his people's ethnic beliefs. "Aw, Mr. Barry, I left the stuff behind when I came down from the mountains ..." - referring to the mystic who seldom sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> When it comes to supernatural fare, this movie is still enjoyable.
