OK, so the songs were badly written and generally badly sung (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by letting the king and his nobles sing about the "fight" with the ogre and praising Puss's efforts in Boots, if they had not known about it /> Wen is that interested? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken who shoots a fairytale-based movie and he sings and dances. His acting style fits very well with the role of the sneaky, mischievous puss that seems to bring his master deeper and deeper into trouble, but in fact has a plan to which he has thought in advance seven or eight moves. And if you have ever seen walking in one of his villainous roles, you know that the ogre bit HART in the end when Walken put him in his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must for anyone who likes the unique style of Christopher Walken.
