This is a great movie for all ages. It is the story of three animals, how to find their way home. At the end and mostly throughout the movie, there is a small twist. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and laugh. They just do not know what's going to happen next. The Trek Home is beautiful with all the beautiful wildlife scenes. The producers also spent a lot of money on this movie and that shows too. The animals in this film were well trained and are themselves great actors / actresses.
