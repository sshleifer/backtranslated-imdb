Only given the fact that it is based on the most notorious mass murder of modern times, it would have been enough to pay attention to this two-part, 1980 produced for the TV movie. The fact, however, is that it is a great reiteration of the life of Rev. Jim Jones who turned a church into a virtual realm and encouraged them to break into a bad cult in which a congressman and his entourage were murdered 917 cultists Suicide by drinking cyanide doused Kool-Aid. <br /> <br /> Very tastefully done, but horrible enough, unlike the torturous sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED, GUYANA TRAGEDY offers an all-star cast including Ned Beatty (as representative of Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first major role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. He actually becomes a man, and his performance is fascinating and daunting. No wonder that this film still attracts attention after more than twenty years.
