Riding Giants is an incredible documentary that tells the story and stories of the three influential Big Wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did a fantastic job assuming the role of the director, and it should be congratulated that he has done such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is brilliantly cut and fits perfectly with narration, interviews, animation and surfing material. The music soundtrack contributes to the overall satisfaction of the movie and makes Riding Giants a brilliant rendition. Personal highlights include comments by Greg Noll, with his straightforward openness, Laird Hamilton's footage at Teahupoo and the out-takes at the end of the film. But this whole movie is really a big, recommendable highlight, which is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It's a shame that it's not better known, but it's a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
