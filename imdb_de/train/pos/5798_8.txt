I saw this for the first time when they were showing it around Easter time 1993/4, and at that time I did not think much about it. I bought it on DVD last summer when I started with Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and now I enjoy it more. I'm older. It's a good movie, but it will not be this classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, the Wizard of Oz, and so on. Michael Jackson as an actor was good, as were the other actors. There were disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie, who was beaten by gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song in the movie was Smooth Criminal. I think it was better than thriller in my opinion.
