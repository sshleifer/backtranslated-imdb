This anime seriously rocked my socks. When the anime first opened, I felt it was too slow. The story was not making much headway, and Shirou was a rather inconspicuous male lead. Once he has learned more about finding trails and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story becomes clear and you can see several facets of it moving together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Also, I felt that the way the characters evolved was very appropriate to evolve with the way real people evolve in the real world. There were no stupid, completely obvious things; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their respective personalities was just interesting to watch. Some of the "surprise people" (Gilgamesh?) Rails in one way or another are unique from the rest of the cast, meaning that "Generic Bad-ass A" was not replaced by "Generic" Bad-ass B "once A died <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the music, the opening music rocked and the final theme of the last episode became simple ... The theme of the last episode has been taken seriously further, good work, Type-MOON!
