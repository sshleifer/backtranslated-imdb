Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. As I grew up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn out. My family received a VHS copy of this movie when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure if it was a film suitable for a 10-year-old movie. However, as we had just bought a new VHS system, I allowed it to me. <br /> <br /> Is every little boy a dream? The movie contains a great scenery, big muscular barbarians, gorgeous topless women, big bad monsters and jokes that you only get when you get older. So a few days ago I inserted the video and after a long time watched the movie again. At first I was bored, then thought about how much I loved this movie as a kid, and kept looking. Yes, the experience was not as great as I remembered. Acting is pretty bad, the plot is pretty bad, the jokes were not funny anymore, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I grew up. Although the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. Do you know that for the good old days?
