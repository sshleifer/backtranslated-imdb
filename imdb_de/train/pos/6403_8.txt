MEN OF HONOR introduces Cuba Gooding Jr., which is probably his best performance so far. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of tremendous courage and heroism. He is a poor southern dirtman who wants to become a marine diver - but he has problems with his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck, but has more and more respect for brashear. The film is about how Brashear does not even have to hit twice the almost insurmountable contradictions. The performances make this movie special. Gooding is great and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, delivers an outstanding performance - his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film puts the patriotism a bit too strong (although it was not near the level in THE PATRIOT), and some of the characters are only one-dimensionally bad (Mr. Holly Pohn is just so bad), but the movie is one today Rarity among the films. It is uplifting and uncynical. A wonderful movie.
