I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he was going to become an icon and "Wanted: Dead of Alive" would start in the same year this movie appeared, or two years later in The Magnificent Seven, he would not done it. But he did it, and we are all the richer. <br /> <br /> Certain that it is a classic of the camp. Horror, as it was intended for the drive-in cinema. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the last lines of the movie were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic stays cold. <br /> <br /> 52 years ago you would never have imagined that the Arctic would thaw. The blob will return soon.
