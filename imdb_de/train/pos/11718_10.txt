Those who love Elivra as I did in her late night movies as a host will love this movie - she's just cool - her car is awesome and she's a little bit like a Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she's so innocent and so on naive - and all the while sexy - and more than just a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are also well done, and the comic cast is awesome, with Edie McClurg in her usual best shape - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is weird. Every time I scratch something to top myself, I think of Elvira crushing the potato chips. <br /> <br /> This movie can be seen again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get the sequel, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it's equivalent ----
