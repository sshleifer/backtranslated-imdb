Real movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who rate this film as one star and call it unrealistic. Although I had neither the background nor the environment of the protagonists, I worked for many years in quarters with lower incomes and in working classes. I feel that acting is very real and representative of the behavior of adolescents. I do not know what the basis for the comments of others is, the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> The low production value did not bother me. I felt that natural light enhanced the character of the movie. The focus was entirely on the story and character development and not on dazzling Hollywood supports or melodramas. <br /> <br /> I have completely dealt with the motivations and reactions of the characters. The acting was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you enjoy good character dramas, then you see it. <br /> <br /> (To the negative commentators who are "trolls": Click on their name and you will see that most have no or only negative reviews.)
