This was a movie I had heard about all my life as an adult, but had never seen until a few years ago. It's the call that really went on. I knew about Michael Myers, had seen the mask and seen commercials for all the other nasty consequences. But I grew up in the decade when Jason and Freddy let the horror game go dead and never thought of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was cheated on cheap prints. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really scary movie. By today's standards, it's not as graphic and visceral, but this film offers the most horror movies on all other levels that are not reached today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so scary, and the fact that she is in a picturesque town to the west is testament to his skills. The lighting effects are frightening, and "The Shape" seems to appear in the shadows at will and disappear. The simple, yet brutally effective music score only adds to the excitement. <br /> <br /> The performances of all players are well done, with special names to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so nice and vulnerable. It is all the more frightening when she is persecuted by Michael Myers because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and escape. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis likes to be a man on a mission and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the city is in because he knows what evil does in his streets. <br /> <br /> All in all, Halloween is not just a great horror movie, it's also a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the audience and never lets up. This should be the default setting for anyone who wants to experience a really scary movie. And for an even more terrible time, you should look at it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" walking in the shadows!
