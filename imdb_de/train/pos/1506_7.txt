Before films like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed the perspective of horror forever, there was a more gothic and far less violent era in this genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and "Rosemary's Baby" scared and thrilled audiences in the '60s and early' 70s. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie in my childhood, but I did it because there was something in it. I did not want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies films of the 70s and 80s and movies like this production of the famous but unfortunately long-standing Amicus film company. That was a good start. <br /> A great, scary music score. Strong achievements from an excellent cast. Brilliant cinematography. There are plenty of good, old-fashioned thrills, especially in the first and last vignette. Some haunting moments and pictures. Moves slowly but steadily. The house is an eerie, oppressive apartment. Great production design and set decoration that give the movie a real gothic horror feeling. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than bloody neck training and exciting nudity. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Some problems with the pace in the first half. Aside from The Cloak, the rest of the stories feel like they've been made before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, 'Waxworks', has good acting and moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and tension. The low budget sometimes shows up really. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rented it so often. It's by no means a masterpiece, but it's a great example of a time when horror movies were made in style and class. Look at this with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
