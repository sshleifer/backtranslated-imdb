Watching impulses is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are a rarity, and when you look like "impulses," that's something you can embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. That might have sounded like a zombie movie, but "impetus" is far superior to any boring "zombie festival," and originality shines through in almost every scene. One has the feeling that such a thing might actually have happened, although the script is pure fiction. From the "Grabber" opening to the credits you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - MERK
