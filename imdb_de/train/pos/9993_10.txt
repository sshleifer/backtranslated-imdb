The funniest and funniest Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch the tape 100 times and watch it again. I laugh my cock and cry in some moments. It's a really good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks, this is a must! In short, Brooks (Billionare) goes homeless on the streets for 30 days to gain the entire poor district from his rival. Reality bites, but in the end it's about warm relationships between people ... Highly Recommended!
