I appreciated the photography, the textures, the colors, and often, unlike a commentary, the lighting. What I missed was a coherent action. I often found them incoherent, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125 m. Maybe the cuts and subtitles did not help. I welcome all movies that escaped the Hollywood mold, but that disappointed me. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were all right, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another movie that has an affinity with this movie, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
