I saw the original English version on video. Disney's choice of speakers looks promising. I can not believe that I say that. The story is about a little boy who meets a girl with a story connected to his own story. The two are thrown into one of the funniest and most intriguing storylines of an animated movie. The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disney's job as a delivery service from Kiki, you can see the quality in their production. It almost redeems them because they stole the story of the white lion Kimba. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki's films are properly published! I can not wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!
