Otto Preminger's Noir classic looks almost like a flip side of LAURA ... While this film was glittering and featured the high-resolution Clifton Webb, this movie is much more velvety. Dana Andrews is a less than good police officer who accidentally kills a man just to possibly hold him to the father of the girl he loves. Preminger makes sure that things run in a neat clip, so that gaps in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (much less wood than he used to be) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is breathtaking! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must and a great companion to Preminger's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also with Tierney).
