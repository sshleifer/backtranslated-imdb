The film reveals the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - usually women - who collected footage of the Chinese business owner who shared his blatant and fraudulent point of view, his American counterpart also as blatant and insane, the oppressed workers who get a vote, and of course, the drunken Americans who wear the pearl necklaces that recklessly celebrate in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people who make their pearl necklaces are paid at $ 0.10 per hour. They also feel that the workers have a chance to avoid working in the pearl factory, but they are likely to do so if they are fed up with the factory owner's popular punitive treatment and / or they are simply too exhausted to work 20 Hours a day hard work. <br /> <br /> I was wondering where these chains came from, unaware of how complicated and tedious it would be to make them. I really appreciated this movie because it miraculously depicts the effects of American enjoyment on something that in our society we consider relatively harmless to people on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And sure, just the tip of the iceberg!
