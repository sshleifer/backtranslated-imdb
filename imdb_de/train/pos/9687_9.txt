A talking parrot is not an enormously inventive idea for a new movie, but Paulie transforms a simple idea into a brilliant, heartwarming movie that will delight the whole family. It manages to close the gap between sentimental garbage and cruel hardship during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events in the film lead to a most satisfying emotional outcome. The animal training is well done - everyone is affected when Paulie spreads his wings for the first time and flies. Paulie is a great character and should have been far more successful, though this movie was not a highlight in 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. These one and a half hours will surely be a pleasant one and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy, and interesting story - from the moment he is first seen, until he is reunited with his original owner, you will enjoy watching him follow him, how he learns friendship and the gritty realities of life along the island way. Not to be missed, if you have any heart or feeling. 9.10
