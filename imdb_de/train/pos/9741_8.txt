I was pleasantly surprised to discover that "How to Lose Friends" and "Alienate People" was not a comedy when the trailer was expecting me. I dealt quickly with the unfolding of the narrative and remained thoroughly absorbed. The pace of the more visually humorous content was, I thought, just right. (I mean, I got the impression that I saw Pegg trying to restore the lost control, so to speak "in real time"). At other times, one could share the reflection of the main protagonists (ie, Peggs and Dunsts), how the events influenced them, and what had brought them to where they were now. All characters were well-filled, sometimes interesting in themselves and in general quite sympathetic. (Every obvious reckless ambition has tended to be tempered by a correspondingly good-natured indulgence.) An entertaining, intelligently-co-ordinated, brilliantly directed, and well-rehearsed film that I would highly recommend.
