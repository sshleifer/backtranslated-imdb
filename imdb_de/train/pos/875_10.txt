Well, what can I say after watching this fantastic movie, when my nerves are still chattering! Jacques Audiard, the director, must rightly have made a name for himself in France. Vince Cassel is not a Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not a Penelope Cruz, either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tight and captivating thriller that slowly starts off with a smart build of character and then triggers tension on a wonderful tense climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays their role perfectly, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and everything seems to be so real, not a stupid gun game, the fight when happens so believably, the expressions, the emotions, it's almost as you are there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, get the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the lights, pick up the phone and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
