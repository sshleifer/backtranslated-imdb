CREEP is a real-time, horror movie that wants nothing more than to show how people are attacked by a mutant for 85 minutes on an empty subway platform. And that's exactly what it does. Not more, not less. Director Christopher Smith honors the drama as far as is plausibly possible by introducing a number of characters who actually have a reason to be in the subway after being banned. He also deliberately leaves the origins of the titular creep undetermined (unlawful experiments that take place in the underground of the 60s are hinted at) and this little mystery works for the most part. Unfortunately, it undermines itself towards the end by actually holding back from a twist-end, where more genetic abnormalities would occur (they are also hinted at). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a clich√© end! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as a terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.
