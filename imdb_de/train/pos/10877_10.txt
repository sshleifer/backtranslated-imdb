I saw this movie with some friends and although only two of us went out of the cinema and thought how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, that's because it should not be taken so seriously, basically it's a movie that mocks horror movies and does damn good work ?? Well, that's Aussie and original !!! Jessica Napier makes a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a clear future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was even better. The impossible princess was queen of the screen !! I recommend to watch this movie as you will be guessing the connection with Raffy, Hilary and The Movie until the end, which was never completed 20 years ago.
