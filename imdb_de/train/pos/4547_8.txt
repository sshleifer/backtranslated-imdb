This could be a 10 if the predictable and hollywood scenario were not. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the main actors of our time (why I can not ask the leadership) and the rest of the cast is at a very high level. I was personally impressed by Hugh O'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene in which I saw him was really strong. Impressive.
