If you played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, you've seen it all. To really experience it, you should get the DC version. Put simply, it's a much better graphic game. The textures are sharp, the layers are easy to navigate and they have a much better sound than the PS cousin. I bought this game in the late '00s and it continues today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game, but if you're a fan of "Ol Web Head," you'll have to buy it yourself for your game library. Swinging around the city as Spidey never looked so good in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, grab that cheap. The DC version is just incredible.
