I think this show is screaming funny! It's not for everyone, and I will not exalt or belittle the people who do not understand it. I'm sure it's wonderful smart people working with a different wavelength. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-injured loser named "Sarah Silverman," who often finds himself in Homeric relationships (that's "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief appearance on Saturday Night Live in the early '90s. I liked her right away, and I'll do anything to see what she's done. <br /> <br /> This show makes Choke-on-your-Food-and-Wet-Your-Pants funny. That's why I always put it on quickly and wear diapers for adults. Listen!
