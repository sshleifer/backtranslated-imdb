Do not look for an overdeveloped plot here ... just sit back with popcorn and enjoy it. In this live-action comedy, which is characterized by incredible make-up and set design, the stars of the classic cartoon character are impressed by the stars of the Beatles, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
