I would have given this movie a few stars simply because it was a "lifetime" presentation that was actually filmed at the site shown in the story - here in New York City. Most on this channel, whether "set" in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or any other Canadian area. <br /> <br /> But if ever there was one worthy of the top rating - 10 * on this site, it is this movie. Surely not for originality, because this story has been made many times in many variations, with some of these very similar. It was also often done on the big screen, with past and present megastars, by Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and others - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many others. I can imagine at least ten to twelve more, equally prominent, past and present, out of my mind that could be added now, and there are probably many others that might come to mind. <br /> <Not to drown, but I think this is by far one of the best in the genre I've ever seen. I happened to meet it on a Friday lunchtime, at a time when I turned on the TV just because it took a few hours after a particularly hectic week. In the 8 years since its creation I have never met this movie. And although the two leads did enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), whom I had seen in her youth, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend), who stood out as "Gramma," the menacing juice loan, Street People "Rounders". <br /> <br /> The chance meeting and coupling between the best friends of the two main roles, as sub-story romance, where the correlation between Anna and Charlie, which Anna and Charlie only later revealed to everyone, is often made plotter within the genre but for the enjoyment here no matter (in fact, it improves). <br /> <br /> When I review a few other comments, I agree with those who are the most positive. The most important word describing this film is ENGAGING in capital letters. This adjective describes the actors. the characters; the chemistry between and among all characters, in whatever combination, and in all supporting and even subordinate roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with "harder edge": "Rounders;" the escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone; "Goodfellows" Even the classics like "Casablanca", "Gone with the Wind", "Citizen Kane". But for the pure, uncomplicated enjoyment this was excellent. At just under a fraction of their budget, it had grown out of "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have been better here than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan; The co-stars and support staff were the same in those mega movies.
