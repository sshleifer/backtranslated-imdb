You can say so much about this movie. It is not your typical Nonneploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but that's almost random in the story. <br /> <br /> It is set in the 15th century in Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The struggle between Muslims and Christians occupies a large part of the film. It was interesting when everyone was walking in front of the Muslim hordes, the Mother Superior asked, "Why are you afraid of the Muslims, you will do nothing that the Christians have done to you?" Certainly there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent because she challenged her father. She witnesses and endures many things: a stallion's gelding, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was overwhelmed during a visit to the Tarantula sect, and a flogging when she ran away with a Jew , The torture was particularly cruel because hot wax was poured on the nun and her nipples were cut off. Sister Flavia will inevitably get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives. She even asks Jesus why the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are all men. Finally, she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they release the monastery. Here you can see more meat than you can enjoy at once. But a tragedy will come. She manages to suffer sweet revenge on all, including the Duke and her father, but notes that the Muslim lover treats her the same way. She is a woman and that is all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the Church did to this heretic in the end, but they are older than the torture of Saw or Hostel for decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be pleased with the treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
