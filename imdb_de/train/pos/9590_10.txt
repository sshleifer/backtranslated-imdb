The documentary begins in 1986 in NYC, where black and Hispanic drag queens hold "balls". There they dress as they please, stretch their clothes in front of an audience and are chosen. We get to know many members and see how they all hold together and support each other. As one man says to another - "You have three hits against you - you are black, gay and a drag queen". These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only on the balls. There they can be, whoever and whatever they want and are accepted. Then the movie cuts off three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragic for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but it is not. Most respondents are actually very funny and get a lot of humor from their situations. They are aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - as they should. We find that they all live in "houses" run by different "mothers" and that they help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this film came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a great success. It won Best Documentary Film at numerous festivals - but was never nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason was "Black and Hispanic Drag Queens are not material of the Academy". Fascinating, right? Homophobia and racism together. <br /> <br /> Today it is still a great movie - and a piece of the past. It just is not like this anymore - the NY they show no longer exists. The balls are still held, but not in the spirit that we see here. Even resistance is more "accepted" in society (for better or for worse). And I heard that the houses have gone too. That is somehow sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know that two died from AIDS, but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to the shown 13-year-old and 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a unique documentary - fascinating, funny and fascinating. One has to see the whole way! A definite 10. Where is the DVD ???
