"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heir who is betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis, arrives at the crumbling castle of the family and learns The mythical Ursine beast is said to roam the nearby forest. It is alleged that a former lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once perverse sex with the creature and Lucy feels consumed by dreams of the incident. "The Beast" is an art-house mix of surreal horror, explicit sleaze and pornography. In the priesthood are bestiality, attack and perversion, plenty of fake ejaculates on bared breasts, masturbation with a rose and especially the graphic representation of everything the episode The eponymous beast plays with incredibly large phallus. Still, this real erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. The women here are breathtakingly beautiful and they are mostly naked. All in all, "La Bête" is a visual feast. Whether this is fetishism With great attention to detail or visual motifs that are infused with information, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be carefully and carefully watched. A must for fans of European cult cinema.
