Louis Sachar's compelling children's classic is about as Disney as Freddy Krueger. There is murder, racism, disfigurement of faces and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> Hard-planned, a multi-layered, coherent story that spans history, revealing Stanley's own heritage and the mystery behind the holes. It runs from Latvia's lush greenery to Pock marked Camp Green Lake (note: there is no lake and no green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success brings the novel's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without shine. The other plus is in the casting. Up and coming star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the big boy in the book, but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual sheer hero. The rest of the cast is equally well filled, from Patricia Arquette as Frontier robber of the Frontier School to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the mood at the end brought to full volume.
