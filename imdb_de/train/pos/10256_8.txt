The first part of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff movie discovered by the producers and built like an amateur camcorder tape with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It portrays a woman abducted by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before she is eventually killed. The unfortunate victim is brutally beaten and thrown with raw meat before the fingernails are pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye is punctured with a needle and so on. <br /> <br /> In the grimest disgusting In the scene, the woman's kidnappers burn them with hot water and throw living maggots into the burns. The series received a lot of attention when American actor Charlie Sheen, who believed the series had stopped the actual murder, was trying to ban distribution in the US. An FBI investigation found that the movies were just what they saw most viewers - sick recoveries with nasty but obvious special effects. This film is staged by the famous Japanese cartoonist Hideshi Hino, who also staged the third and fourth episodes. He is a sure way to clear all the rooms except the most tolerant rooms. But Gorehounds will probably not find anything special.
