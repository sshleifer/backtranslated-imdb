I love bed buttons and brooms so much that I have to cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the great pleasure of seeing them. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love it so much. Too many have already said. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all the same. I also love everyone who loves it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on Portobello Road. I have learned the dance moves and practice them every day. I have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. if someone can play the drums or the guitar, I think of making a bed-knob and broom band. love me (liz)
