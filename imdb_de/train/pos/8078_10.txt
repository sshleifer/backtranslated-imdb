Although this was a disaster at the box office, it's my favorite movie. There is a strong message from the family. It has a lot of violence and has a song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh portrays this in this movie. Do not read reviews from critics, they are just ignorant. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and above all action. So if you want to see action more realistically than Main Hoon Na (still good movie), this is the movie.
