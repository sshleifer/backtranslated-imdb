This timeless saying echoes in this movie and in my heart. So many years have I been waiting to see this eternal story! Maybe I was not finished. It is possible that my feelings did not appreciate their power. I now gratefully welcome in my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI was a long time ago. His is now a legendary luminescence. But now I've finally discovered the priceless gifts of LUISE RAINER's great talents. Oh, how many faces can speak like theirs? Some have said that she came from her quiet years, and this might have been good, but her speech is eloquent enough when given a chance. She deserves her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is in an epic with the most classic proportions. All parts are the same, necessary and perfect. Nonsayers may go away if they wish, but they would avoid storytelling that lasts a lifetime. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD EARTH enriches you in a way that you do not expect. But not everything will come out of it with the joy that I did. But I can only hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not bother me with mere technical details regarding the race of the main players. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I dare a million dozen recent films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such dignity, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If a modern artist dares to remake this masterpiece, then I'll warn you it will never match the aromatic fragrance that still comes from the heart of this narrative. Time will not diminish this effort or improve its size.
