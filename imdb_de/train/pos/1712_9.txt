This film was a disaster in Box Office, and the reason for this is the innocence of the movie, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good. The director did his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines again in his role, he has done his best in comedy or in the emotional scene. Soha looks so cute in the movie. Rest Star Cast was just fine. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is impressive here as a singer. Do not miss this movie, it's a wonderful movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay's best work to date. I will give Ahista Ahista 9/10.
