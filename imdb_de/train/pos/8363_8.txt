This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace films from the German series - it contains all the basics for a very pleasing Wallace thriller from the 60s: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing, you still have the young Joachim 'Blacky " Fuchsberger, once again starring as a typically American "womanizer", has the young Eddi Arendt in his best (and equally typical) role, the cool, sophisticated British butler, and you have (not so young) Lowitz as a melancholic, yet very "dry" ironic (and therefore very entertaining) police judge, you also get a freaky and very campy "bad guy" behind a frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), you get a crazy, swinging soundtrack , classic B-movie action scenes, some of which were filmed outside of the movie, have wildest perspectives (please remember the time at the origin!), screaming queens, un d so on and so on ... All these ingredients are shaken well in a sweet cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace-Campyness - highly recommended !!
