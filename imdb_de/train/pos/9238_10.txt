Although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", you will notice that the dialogue from this video edition was worked out when watching the original shows , I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added. I would say if you want to see the show in its original version, watch the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes now available on DVD. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica in 1980 than the actual broadcasts. Overall, I rate this as 10 because it allows you to enjoy more than what the networks wanted to show in the window they gave to the producers.
