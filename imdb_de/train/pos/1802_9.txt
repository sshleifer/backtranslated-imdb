Okay, I saw this movie as a kid and I really liked it. My parents never bought the movie for me, but I think I'll go and buy it now. I'm a jerk for animated films from before 2000. Anyway, to the current review. <br /> <br /> WHAT I WANT: There was an actual depiction of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify characters in this movie (ie: Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical, but believes that Charlie, Carface is obviously the relentless villain, etc.). I also loved King Gator's song. I've always loved loud, annoying, extravagant guys. This song was probably random, but it was fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could say that Charlie was totally rude and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I WAS NOT: The actual depiction of Heaven: The way Charlie responded, "no surprises", made it seem to be very boring. He denied a place in the sky and in the end he had to return there. I remember a few lines of certain songs like "... you can not keep a good dog down", "... let's make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead", but I can not remember the majority of them. To be honest, the songs were not so catchy. Whippet Angel: It sucks and the neck! AUGH! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS CAN NOT LIKE: During the movie some very scary (depending on the audience) pictures of hell are shown. Carface is pretty threatening. Beer is also implied, but not DUBBED beer. Playing is a key element in the movie. The good one dies. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: I LOVE this movie, even though it is sometimes forgotten. The scariest kid's animations are always my favorites. This came at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to scare children off and on. Nowadays, this would probably have been rated PG. Children under 8 years (or slightly disturbed children) should not observe this. Apart from that I give 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Enjoy watching!
