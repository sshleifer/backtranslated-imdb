I thought it worked really well for a first episode of a first series. It was really fun and I found the actors brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone to say that it's bad because it looked the right time. I find it really annoying when people say that it was historically incorrect because it should be a Saturday night entertainment show and not boring history documentary. I think the costumes and attitudes were just right. A brilliant start and I'll love what's next !! I have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show! We all think it's great entertainment and it has great stories to it.
