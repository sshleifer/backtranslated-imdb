Another fantastic film from a country in which passionate issues have not been troubled by decades of suppression by fundamentalist regimes. Panahi takes a different approach this time with a mixture of ironic comedy and a lovable, non-professional cast. While he still radiates his message, which he has found inherently wrong in his country, he does so without the need for any serious action. It is a positive attitude for a country, especially for the people that the Iranian people urgently need. The biggest pity is that it will not be released domestically. The paranoid Iranian government claims that the filmmaker is successful overseas only because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. Having grown up in the midst of the revolution and watching academics, artists and educated people "disappear" in the last 25 years, he shows great courage in continuing his work there. The realism achieved by shooting for the actual World Cup qualifier really gets you to the event. The fact that he has shot at 35mm is amazing, as most would try this project only with a digital format. It looks fantastic. His effort to use only non-professional actors also works in this film. All around good services. After watching a lot of films showing the problems of Iran, as well as the news media reporting the facts, we can demonize the people and the government. This movie does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things, and that when you laugh at yourself and the absurd rules of Sharia law, a change for the better is not too far. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I believe he only fights for the most oppressed populations in Iran. Young, independent women.
