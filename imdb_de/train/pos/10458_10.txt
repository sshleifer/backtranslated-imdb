This film deals with one of the most dreaded geriatric diseases of today's aging. As one who has met a number of families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's or who are in the educational stage, I would suggest that every health care provider recommend this film to every family that faces the trauma of the disease. The film is primarily intended to speak with the patient's family and reaches into the heart of the fight. The casting is superb and the dramatic performance is superb with a superior plot.
