I found that Gray Garden was a gripping movie, a surprisingly intimate <br /> <br /> look at to eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forget the company and live in a neglected house with no heating and a huge one <br /> <br /> Brood of cats and raccoons who pursue their own interests, instead mundainly, chatting with the camera all the time. <br /> <br /> Great Edie and Little Edie are the two madmen who have documented the Mazles Bros. They look like characters from a <br /> <br /> Fellini movie, only strangers, if that makes sense. Old Edie is almost completely bedridden, with a pile of papers, clothes, and dirty dishes growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She dances around the house and always wears a baboushka-like headdress that completely covers her hair. We have never seen her hair in the whole movie, nor do we get a clue that she has much left. However, at the age of fifty-eight, she is still beautiful and full of life. In Gray Gardens we have the feeling that these two women are <br /> <br /> lives have become much less than they used to. Little Edie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother married in her earlier years, started a family, lived luxuriously and even took some pictures (the scene where she sings at 77). Along with a recording of "Tea for Two" that she made decades ago (a Edie left her promising career as a <br /> model to look after her suffering mother, and at age 58 she still longed to find her prince charming, if that , then Little Edie is still a little girl, full of dreams of glamor and fame, and of domestic and romantic happiness that have not yet been fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Among the highlights of the film are the opening moments in which Little Edie her camera outfit explains the "Tea for Two" series, the <br /> <br /> birthday party scene, the climate change dispute, the grocery delivery scene and the loft scene always open and unpretentious. And it is all the more remarkable than it really is. <br /> <br /> I propose to see Gray Gardens in a row with Kenneth's cheek short puce moment. The Criterion DVD costs $ 35.00, but is worth every penny.
