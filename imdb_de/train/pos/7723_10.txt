A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still think that this is the most important sci-fi movie ever made, despite some acting, outdated dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> First there is the scale In the description of the Krell, a humanoid race based on the planet, all are dead, who were one million years more advanced than the Earth humans (us), and their technology, in particular the 8000 cubic mile Machine. <br /> <br Secondly, there are the music and sound effects that are inextricably linked. It creates an eerie, eerie feeling, in contrast to "2001", which had traditional classical music. Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadliest that has ever been considered, but is based on true science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made that attempts to create a truthful, intelligent and merciless film that provides a logical statement about the limits or limits of a person's development (or another biological entity), no matter how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
