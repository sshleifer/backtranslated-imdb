2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes it can record with Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. Acting was a tip-top of an independent film. Jeremy Earl has been in great shape since his career on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy joke, as he was last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next appearance of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My Bus !! It's gone ..." was. That was the true turning point of the movie. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart when you see white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis. Through thick (held on the knife) and thin (Nathan gives Tony tips to women), the new dynamic duo has arrived and wants to conquer Hollywood.
