My left foot is, in my opinion, a great biography of one of the most talented writers and painters in the world. The performances were overwhelming, the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, though I did not understand what he said most of the time. When he got a tantrum, I got a bit scared. It is also so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. Conclusion: If you're an avid fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics, I recommend this great biography of one of the world's most talented writers and painters. It's a real treat and a good time, so do not miss it.
