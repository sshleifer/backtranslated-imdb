Having seen both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap," I can honestly say both films really need to be seen. There will be many times in "fear" that you become hysterical. It's no wonder why both movies have such a big cult. "Fear" will be available on DVD soon. Rent it if you have to, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
