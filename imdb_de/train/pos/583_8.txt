In a small town in Montana, two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Her father is Reverend Maclean and they are growing up with his religion-related lessons and the lessons of fly fishing. In this movie, fly fishing is a bit of a take on life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention, although there are a few moments when you need some action. The film probably has these moments because it's not really about the events that happen, it's about the message. However, some things happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years, he returns and engages with a cute girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd). He is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has become a reporter and is known as a "fishing reporter". He is famous and it seems he has a nice life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, has a good score and all the actors are good at it. The nicest thing about this film is the cinematography. The mountains, the forests and the river look very beautiful. If the movie was made just for those things, it was good enough to watch. Luckily, there is more.
