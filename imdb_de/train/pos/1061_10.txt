The acting of the first season was really amazing. The first look you get from Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or what I like to call Minis. The minis are doing the best acting job I have ever seen. the main actors and actresses, d. H. Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc let you forget that you are watching a fictitious TV. show they seem to make this show come alive. All in all, this is the best show I have ever seen
