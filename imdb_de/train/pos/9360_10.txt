Let me start by saying that at the age of 34, I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated because he was NOT sick - he unexpectedly died of a heart attack - his carotids blew up - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from the police, because he fell on something and it rammed his head. I was suspected of murder until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as I was, so in love with a good father figure like him. I had three small children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my parents-in-law verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually attacked me, I did not grieve for the children, put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see, they do not show My pain during the holidays ... No one has fought for me and my decision to spend a holiday outside, except, of course, the mourning therapist, whom I saw, who had advised me to follow my heart and my soul. My in-laws did not understand it! My relationship with them changed forever, and I've never been back for a holiday. This is just one example of how my grief was respected! My own (new) husband saw me split over the trauma as I shared my soul. I collapse, can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally die for a few days when trying to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now for this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul was touched, my heart was broken. My fears and pains came back from the real demons this movie presents. how to grieve in comparison to the expectations of others and the demons. Adam Sandler has perfectly survived the terrible agony that you are facing, and above all, worked through your own time! This movie has used up all the pain I've tried over the years. You see, if something harms your soul so deeply, so deeply that utterances are anything that comes out of your mouth in moments of thought, you can not handle it without wishing that you were dead and in a dead state would go through life. <br /> <br /> The Bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26, to which I have clung to. If my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, then God's Holy Spirit carries this agony to the feet of God. - I do not have to speak. Sandler has shown that perfectly! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was brought to a hearing for mental health reasons, and he goes back to his in-laws --- (trust me) --- and he tells them the amazing truths he possessed by himself and which he can not overcome. It is a powerful and powerful achievement. I started howling and it was hard for me to leave the theater after getting up and feel my legs too weak. My son was with me and saw it first-hand, my precise movements as he tried to hold everything together; a lesson for him, my youngest, who hardly remembers his father. It was 13 years for me, but this movie brought me back to the moment when I lost my parents-in-law forever, when they demanded a mask for my feelings and my devotion to their wishes, instead of paying my own respect. <br /> <br /> I write this, so if you are a mourner, you are prepared for this movie, but commend it in the 1000-star performance that Sandler has given. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a mourner, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept the decisions of the people in their grief. Let her find peace in her own time! Sometimes the soul can not express the words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie with tissues and not without preparing to bring it to your soul!
