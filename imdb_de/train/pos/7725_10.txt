I first saw this movie when it first came out. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie both entertaining and very scary and unlike any other movie I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a big star in the constellation Aquilae, to find out what happened to a colony of settlers that landed twenty years ago and has not been heard since. TOPIC: An Inferior Civilization (Ours) Comes into Contact The remnants of a highly advanced alien civilization that removed Krell-200,000 years ago. The "seed" of the destruction of one civilization is first subconsciously passed on to another. The theme of this movie is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time with my brother when he first came out. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me, as well as the battle scenes with the invisible creature power. I was also amazed at how things really looked in the movie. <br /> <br /> What really interests me as an adult is the truth of the film "forbidden knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we do it (if at all) in contact with an advanced (foreign) civilization, which is far more developed than we ourselves are. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We need to do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of using advanced technologies. This, in my opinion, is the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that "knowledge is power" is not correct at best! Knowledge is "potential" power, depending on how it is applied (if it is applied at all.) [It's not what you know, it's how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> All in all The effects of this movie can be realized in the future of Mankind. The knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom to which knowledge relies to really control our own destiny, OR we will end up just like the Krell in the movie, just extinguished. <br /> <Many thanks to all who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections.
