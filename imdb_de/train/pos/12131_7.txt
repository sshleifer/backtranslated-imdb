The film is about Philip (Leslie Howard), a serious but disabled medical student. He falls in love with a heartless, predatory waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). She leaves him and contacts others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he has a relationship with other applicants (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but the mutually destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and first of numerous movie versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the cruel waitress in the Cockney won another great interpretation with a seductive and smoldering performance, absolutely hypnotic in her report on bondage, which occurs from start to finish. Davis achieved fame with her performance. Her role as hard and coarse The dominant woman is repeated several times in acting. Leslie Howard, the basically good and decent student who has been subtly destroyed, offers a superb and melancholy performance. He was a great actor (Gone with the Wind) next to producer and writer and dead in plane crash during World War II. Both play again in "existing forest" (1936). The atmospheric film, which was lavishly recreated in the RKO studio (Radio Picture Inc.), convinces all along the line. Remade 1946 by Edmund Goulding with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The movie likes classic cinema enthusiasts. Rating: Very good, but a bit dated.
