I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts has played a good Nancy Drew, although she is not so similar to the books. The outfits of old fashion are weird when you see them in modern times, but they look good. For me, the rich girls had no outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they bought all the clothes at a flea market and decided to put everything together. All outfits were sticky, especially if they wore the penny slippers with their normal outfits. I do not want the movie to look bad, because it definitely was not! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will enjoy it!
