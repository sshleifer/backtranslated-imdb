One of my favorite movies. It has it all - rock soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, loads of action, lots of laughter, totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful 80s stereotypes as characters. Eddie, the well-dressed guy who just wants to be alone to be different, Leslie (as wet as they come), Nuke (the rock-burn-out), Eddie's mom (lamentable), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy as a preacher (does he exist in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (empty, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, most of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, a mix of every 80s badass rocker you can imagine. What about this rocket guitar? Then there's the scene where Sammi pulls the old lady through the TV screen and breaks her down. And what is Roger doing? Why, turn it up just like a good geek would. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his long overdue reward from Sammi over his wet finger in the socket - magic! <br /> <br /> If you were rockin 'in the 80s or just love ridiculous movies like me, check them out. It is available on DVD and very cheap, so (trick or), treat yourself.
