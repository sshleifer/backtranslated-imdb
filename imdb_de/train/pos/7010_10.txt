Before I see this movie, I see many comments, each of which has a good look at the movie, whether it's good or bad. <br /> <br /> What I really want to emphasize is acting at Woody Harrelson. He may not be in many parts of the movie, but when he or even the intro appears, I was amazed at Will Smith's "message" and Woody Harrelson, who tried to make the whole plot to the end, to really understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good deed should have no regrets or pity. But one act to show salvation, there are not many films that I think can show this. This is one of them that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with a person who commented that the film shows "suicide" offenses is a downfall, however, I do not think this is the "message" the film is trying to send, though "Victim". A bit extreme, but that's the message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. Acting is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a person who does not really like watching drama movies ... if you like drama, this is a must.
