Although this film seems to be based on a movie of the same title released in 1951 by MGM with Janet Leigh, it is still a great movie. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings to life George Knox, a baseball manager with a slightly mad baseball manager. As for the film as "stacked", how about Christopher Lloyd (his stage acting and shows in his screenings, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock of the Sun), Brenda Fricker (a charming) and well-seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, he's good in this movie too), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be that crucial in this film, but he does received exposure), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey, also applies to Adrien, except for the dizzy and confused part), some great character actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders ( Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of the California Angels) and the rest of the cast are doing a great job a great story that rises too much, I do not care what areas of depression you are in. I loved the movie as a kid, and it brings back memories when I see it today. I need that on DVD. I recommend it to any parent who is looking for something their children have not seen and everyone else.
