Strangely, all previous comments have just described the beginning and left the details. I feel it is necessary to confirm that this is family work, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein and the - excellent - jazz music was written by the father of the director Andr√©. No wonder that under these circumstances it was a really good thriller to release it and immediately identify it with the music. The tension was perfect and remained until the end. Robert Hossein, then one of the best European players, also managed to prevail as a top screen and director. He still holds great stage shows with a preference for religious topics.
