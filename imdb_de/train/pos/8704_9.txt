Lately, a lot of crap comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A friend sends me movies now and then, it's great to my surprise I could not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine Romeo having a superpower, as in Shakepeare. It is both sad and poetic. Hollywood should become aware of the new Russian cinema, it tells stories that are not about big explosions and CGI. It takes a simple basic requirement and tells a story without spectacle. This is similar to an Asian film with a dark Russian note. Granted, it's not perfect, but it's never something. They know what power is, but it is never explained or fully realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the sense of history. I do not want to see a remake, it's too cool, as it is, the Hollywood system would mess it up as usual. Drama is all around first class. Director and camerawork are well above the main part of the garbage. Kudos to all concerned, and I will draw many people's attention to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, look at it.
