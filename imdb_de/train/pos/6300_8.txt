I loved this movie. I thought it was easy to see and easy to forget. After watching I went out to buy the DVD, obv not easily forgotten! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and the casting could not be more perfect. Every character has his moment, and I laughed hard throughout the movie, the comic timing was just right. <br /> <br />
