What I like about you is one of those series that you need to see, but you're not sure if you would see. The beginning is cool and it tears you into the series, just for fun, the second part of Season 2-3, which is rather stale you come and go, whatever you want. What happens in many series is that they do not end in something special, because the second part of the series always goes down the drain, this one too, the third part is the one that usually ruins and ruins the entire series. But that's not it the case, this end is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly. Actually, I was pretty angry with all those guys in Val's life. Actually, I wanted to end up with Jeff at the end, but later it changed. It opted to record Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also, which brought the series to the top. <br /> <br /> Do you often see that the show is really cool? I do not expect the second part to be that good, but the third part does what was needed and made the show one of a kind the whole thing was worth it. I'm glad to say that I was happy and happy about the show and now I'm going to visit two boys, a girl and a pizzeria. If I have seen the whole series, I will come back ...
