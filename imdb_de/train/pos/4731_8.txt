This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors can play as stoically as Jet Li. The action is a rapid fire and special effects have been intensified for intensity reasons. As a result, Americans may be a bit unprepared. A small exposure of unbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I think it's an excellent introduction to Jet's work and I'm looking forward to more masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) making it to the US market. A nice mix of shooting and physical conflict will satisfy most action movie fans.
