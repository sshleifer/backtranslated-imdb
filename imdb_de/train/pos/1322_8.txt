What a fascinating movie. Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a competitor in her element, even if it is not based on real life. And it's the kind of film psychology student who could deal with compulsive liars. The author of the Forbidden Love, Norma, has been exposed in the media as a fraud, but this step really gives her a great opportunity to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists she brings to the documentary filmmaker are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book, but just heard good reviews and saw it on a boring rainy afternoon. The journey you are making with this film is smart, interesting and absolutely fascinating.
