Another funny, frothy RKO musical starring Astaire and Rogers. FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. While the outstanding great sounds of SWNG TIME are lacking (although the last number "Face the music and dance" is one of the best in the team, and rightly so), it is very enjoyable as these two can not go wrong together the 1930s. Again, the plot is easy and memorable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is heaven. These two conveyed more dance and romance than many couples in movies in a huge love scene. Although there are better Fred and Ginger musicals, this is a must.
