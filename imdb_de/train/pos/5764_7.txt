I reviewed this movie about 6 or 7 years ago at Amazon and blew it up. I think I called it "miserable" and "turkey". Okay, with most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production values, the small action makes almost no sense and the spectacle is at the level of a game in the third grade. This has really gotten me over the years as a kind of classic of the camp. In fact, all films by director Todd Sheets had this effect. You're almost like Ed Wood in this regard: watch them over and over again and look for the faded lines, continuity flaws (the same zombie, two different locations!), And other bugs. Say the following: Sheets is a very nice guy, and though This is one of his first productions not so great, he has become better. And I have to add that the only really decent actor / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, even though I'm biased because I went to school with her.
