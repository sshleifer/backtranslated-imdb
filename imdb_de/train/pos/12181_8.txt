"The Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of Hollywood's most problematic productions. Welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made the already cluttered mystery story even harder to track. Due to the density of the Irish accent, much of his dialogue has been re-enacted and the synchronization is too obvious and poorly executed. Most catastrophic were Welles and his actress Rita Hayworth, who were on screen and in real life, and they broke apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry was also expressed on screen by Orson Welles' fantastic direction. He makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene seems to lower your back from the screen. The characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border on the dreamlike and the surreal. This sense of craziness elevates scenes that are commonly found in these films, such as the sequence of courtrooms in the middle. Usually I find court scenes boring, but the direction and quirky touches of Welles make her as intriguing as anything. The end at the carnival is almost reminiscent of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> The acting here is also very good. Despite their failed relationship, Welles and Hayworth perform well - but their interactions are only a little to be desired. Everyone else is great and wonderful to look at, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it is worth to see only a master of cinema at its best. (8/10)
