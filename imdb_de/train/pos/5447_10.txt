Personal taste rules when it comes to movies like this little gem. In the eighties, early eighties, I discovered this movie, like so many that were released at the time, "Night Patrol," "Bad Maners," or even "King Frat," the artwork and the rattle on the Back of the covers seduced and teased you. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are movies like these that I've already mentioned, as well as things like "screwballs" and many others that have stimulated the imagination, and luckily, many years later, I remember them with fondness and some with disdain the many films that sustain my love of such genres as parodies or pastiches. <br /> <br /> Many years after the great success of "Animal House" made and seen how it has been lost Over the years, I now know that there would be no way that this movie the above box office It would still be remembered, similar to National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> Frankly, not everything that bore the National Lampoon logo, however, was a wild success. Class Reunion is still one of my favorite films of all time, with instantly recognizable characters, such as the cautious Bob Spinnaker played perfectly by Gerrit Graham. So good in Charles Terror's "Terror Vision", which still hangs in the past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst's cheeky and spherical turn, as the lazy drunken sex of high school drove the bum Hubert Downs crazy. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. Which makes me think. As I said, the personal taste is not good. People can be so cruel that they never win prizes or are compared to those of their colleagues in the comedy world. It has some merit. As one of the earlier screenplays of John Hughes, who would later write one of his own favorites in his work "Weird Science," and a wonderful theme song from the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, it's a movie that's just waiting to be rediscovered over and over again.
