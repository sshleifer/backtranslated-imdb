I'm getting really old, I'm just going to watch this 40 year old movie and am wondering what my grandchildren will see in 40 years .. it's not just the story, it's the music, the acting of both Jung and also by alto, the role that Judge Oliver has played is in front of me, I have seen in other roles over the years also took a few Golden Globe Awards .. if you decide to watch this movie ... do Do yourself a favor, take a few, if not all, children to see this masterpiece
