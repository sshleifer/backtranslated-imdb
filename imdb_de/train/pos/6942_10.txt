In the fifties, the age restrictions on films in Brazil were as follows: no limitation, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. Normally, the Westerns were allowed to be ten years old, and if they had a bit more violence, they would go to 14, but it was rare that a Western was barred for under-18s. Winchester 73 was one of them, and I think that explains very well how this film deviates from the average. The hero James Stewart fought against his own brother, who had killed her father. He was looking for revenge and seemed pretty traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations of that kind of character in the next few movies he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the lead actress, was anything but virtuous. She followed the man who stayed with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains you'll always remember. The story of the movie, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. It was to be a Fritz Lang movie that did not get through. When Mann was offered, he made a point of starting from zero again and taking nothing that was prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann developed a different idea of ​​Western, preserving all traditions. Winchester is still a great movie that you can see again and again, but nothing will compare to the impression it made on those who saw it when it was originally published.
