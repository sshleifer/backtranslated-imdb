I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman in the world. This movie was very cute and I mean very cute. It had all the "sex" content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have, but with something special, the CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this incredible but believable chemistry that seems to transcend in every scene. Both seem to create this weird, twisted and interesting relationship with a strong "sexual" tension that makes you laugh until you can not feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the minor cast seem to play each other perfectly, and even Wanda Sykes's rather small role will make you laugh. Although this kind of comedy is not for everyone, but I have to say, I went with a person who does not usually like these movies and he laughed like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, as some moments are a bit too small ... let's say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, the end was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
