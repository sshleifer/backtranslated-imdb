"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about the young woman Mariana (named after a famous American movie star "Esther") and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all of whom were probably 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia , The five are dedicated friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or something American that seems like it. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and, in the end, a victim is ready to help one the group that has encountered unexpected difficulties. As part of the change in communist politics, they go their separate ways and meet again in 1985 (a year before the film was filmed). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning there were a number of dialogues that had no subtitles at all. Maybe it was the conversation interval, but I could not always read the text as well as absorb the scene, so I did not always know which figure it was. I saw the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us really understood any part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslav film about growing up has effectively conveyed the sense of invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal attachment of the youths to each other. There is a big flash forward, and it was fascinating. I let myself guess until the end who these characters were given the occupation of 1953 and what had actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by director Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
