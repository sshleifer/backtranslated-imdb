The movie is more about Pony than Gray Owl. It's also about Aborigines, Canada, the English, Gray Owl's aunts, and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie that is more like a book and raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl, who admits his concern for Pony and her reaction. Some observations on the user ratings. Note that user ratings at 5 and 7 are bipolar. it is not for everyone, but has a strong following. This film is underestimated and overlooked but will attract attention for years to come. Few women have seen the movie, but they rate it higher than men. Was it properly marketed? <br /> <br />
