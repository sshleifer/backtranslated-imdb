I learned about the movie "Holes" when I heard that it was not typical for Disney that both children and adults went down in history. Guys, let me tell you, I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy sent to a strange juvenile detention camp in the desert. He becomes friends with a boy nicknamed Zero, and together they embark on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not quite know what to expect when I saw it. It was interesting to see how the story was pieced together like puzzle pieces. The guys who played the juvenile offenders were all very funny and Jon Voight was just funny as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
