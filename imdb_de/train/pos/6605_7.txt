2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles running on several levels in an obvious homage to Fritz Lang's metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and decaying. And between the surveillance courses, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub. A tough police chief determined. In deep blacks and whites, with gloomy corridors, shady streets, and one-handed lighting that is characteristic of the hardiest movie Noir, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story owes Masamune Shirow and William Gibson more than Frank Miller, for high-tech surveillance, near-invisibility camouflage and reckless super-corporations are just as much part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never creates the subterranean atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its techy edge characters colliding with industry types of corporations, all of whom seem to have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer definitely feels that the future Paris is not a utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the police procedural line evolves, we are brought into the darker areas of individual ambition beneath the glossy veneer of Avalon Corporation's cultivated PR image. The motion capture process used here glances between B & W comic books and next-generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or intrusive, depending on taste. However, there is a great visual impact here, and the future of Paris is filled to the tiniest detail, giving the picture a unique look that is Spartan and Baroque. Worth a look.
