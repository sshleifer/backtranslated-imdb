This entertaining and fabulous movie is more of a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than a typical discharged biopic. It has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would expect from an indie movie. I think the tendency is to portray Bettie Page as a kind of sex vixen like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked closely at Bettie's poses, she always looked happy. Not a "you wish you could come with me," a haughty look, or the "I'm just doing that because my acting career did not work," looks like a pornstar. The ladies involved in this film (three female producers, one writer / director, one co-writer, and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who has certainly helped shape that role with their sugary influence) have really captured the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive one Girl from the South, who really enjoyed taking a picture, hoping that good old JC would not be too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol shows a career high (perhaps she has the most perfect breasts ever), which I'm glad to have because she had the curse. A few years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was and addressed her as the next it-girl. And let's face it, that was a bit presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, she never made it to Gwyneth status, though not for lack of talent. If you pick some bad movies, if you're a pretty blonde in fickle Hollywood, that makes you forget that. If this does not put her back on the A-list, then I'll probably be the uncle of a monkey. <br /> <br /> Bettie herself has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pin-up party with a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat honey swims. You were a helluva woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. Congratulations Mary Harron, you have done justice to our cult idol.
