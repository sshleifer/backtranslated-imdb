I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who have seen it. I was not sure if I got it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has made many funny films; Schwesternakt. <br /> <br /> However, this was not a real comedy. It is a drama with comedic moments. So if you are looking for a laugh riot, keep looking. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a black family moving from a pretty neighborhood of the city to a middle-class neighborhood. I would say more, but it would ruin the movie. This film is not just about the race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relationships with the black community. I think it's worth a shot. If you are not really interested in another movie about race relations, this movie is not for you
