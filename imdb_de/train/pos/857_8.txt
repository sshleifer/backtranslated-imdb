Greetings from the darkness. The much-anticipated, twisted comedy of writer / director Richard Shepard is a party for Pierce Brosnan, the actor. This bond guy is gone. This new guy is something else !! I read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too pretty a boy for this plum roll, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and is far from pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. When you come here, you expect headlines and signs of all kinds of sex, murder, religion, sport, business, and anything else that you consider politically incorrect. Brosnan brings an awesome script with his amazing facial gestures and physical movements to another level. Sitting on a hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the direct friend of Brosnan's comic. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear's wife (what's her name for "Bean"?). She gets a bit nervous when she has a presenter in her living room. <br /> <br /> The visuals and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, racetrack and suburb of Denver. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat in the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is aloof and you make risky movies, this could be for you.
