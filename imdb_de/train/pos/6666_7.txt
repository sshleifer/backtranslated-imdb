I can not say that this movie earns close to the amount of vitriol piled on it by some reviewers. Yes, it's getting stuck with overly cushioned running time, unrestrained cut, and too much confidence in the special effects of cheeseballs. And it lacks the energy a comedy needs to get an average audience to look through it without looking at the clock. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are also some funny lines, a talented and serious cast and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as a "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi do a great job, giving the team conflict and variety. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell added a lot to the movie as a whole, though everyone had some chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The story is, as I said above, your classic "underdog-make-good" stuff. No surprises, as you know they will triumph. What's worth is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and the interaction of the characters. Among all of these, these people are at heart children who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes of the film give this film its emotional foundation. Look at Azaria's relationship with his suffering mother; Macy's lovable innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing's secret identity; Stiller's anger (not unlike the strange, brittle child you once knew, who would always be trembling, fainting in the playground); Garofalos desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and kindness will always make the world a better place is the true charm of superhero comics. And under his parody exterior, "Mystery Men" shows why these trite comic tropics matter to so many. <br /> <br /> There is never really any satisfying negotiation (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main presentation is so much fun that it makes up for it. The fact that it's a good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost to some of the reviewers here. So I'll leave a caveat: If you're the type of onlooker who ruined his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy comic, that's inexplicable and illogical ("shall I believe it's a kind of ... snorting *. .. _magic_ xylophone? "), then you are far too literal and humorless for this film. Borrow a Sandler movie instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
