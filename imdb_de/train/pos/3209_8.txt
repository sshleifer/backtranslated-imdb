Interesting mix of comments to which constructive elements are difficult to add. I will try. This was a very good action movie with great set pieces. You'll find that I've specified the genre. I did not complain about the lack of characterization and did not insult the acting. Enjoy, if for what it is humans, a far above average action movie. I could go on, but I left my comment.
