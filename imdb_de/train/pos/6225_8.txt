This was the second of three films written by Irving Berlin for the Astaire Rogers series, and has by far the largest score, and is somewhat unusual in that Harriet Hilliard performs two of those numbers and the remainder is left to split or to be shared between the clients. As usual, the story does not need to stop us, but for the record, it was based on a play, Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for a Broadway musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who has actually seen Shore Leave in the theater may have been amused for a moment, in that the roles Fred and Ginger played were created for the film. But whatever counts is the music, the lyrics and the hoof play, and that's not all right bottle. It's a departure from the other franchise system's titles: 1) We see Astaire playing the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which had a lyrics by Johnny Mercer and spent a few weeks in the charts - and it's the only one of the series in which he played a soldier, although a former hoofer who had enlisted in the Navy after being dismissed by a dance partner Ginger before the story begins He may be a little known but play excellent Berliner number, I'd rather lead a band and duet I'll put all my eggs in a basket, but the ultimate number is the prophetic number - 1936 World War II rumbles already felt - Let's Face The Music And Dance, one of the most powerful ballads the team has ever played. What if Randolph Scott is a bit of wood and fish out of the water without a horse or a six-gun in range and Harriet Hilliard is not setting fire to the screen? We came to see Fred and Ginger, and the only question is if they deliver. Answer: spades
