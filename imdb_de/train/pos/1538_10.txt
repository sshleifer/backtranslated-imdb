This is the best movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live only a few miles from the village where the story takes place, and I know how it works in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! It criticizes and honors the lifestyle of Dalarna as well, and the producer wants people watching the film to be more open-minded and more attentive to their closest friends and relatives in all of Sweden (or any other country) you probably will also recognize a lot from this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Maria Blom!
