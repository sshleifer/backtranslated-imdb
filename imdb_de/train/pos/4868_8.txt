I rated this movie 8 out of 10, 10 for Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire. Slumdog is close to this film, but it's hard to judge this film without understanding the life, mentality and soul of the Balkans, which Kusturica masterfully presents. To understand it, you really have to be a Balkan. This is an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary of his previous films that are boring at the time. I think Kusturica is getting on with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art in itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it now, but remember that I read to my daughter, who would fall asleep a similar story.
