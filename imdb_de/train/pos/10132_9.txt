In this first episode of Friends, we're introduced to the six main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani, and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel, a rich girl who is Monika's high school friend, left her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar since she discovered she does not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent from her father to get a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife is a lesbian and has lost her for Susan, her partner (We see him moving into a new apartment during the episode). <br /> <br /> Monica is in this episode with Paul Wine type "(and finally sleeps), who gave her the excuse to pass out because he divorced his wife. But in fact he just fooled her. <br /> <br /> PS: I just loved the haircuts of Joey and Chandler in this first season! =)
