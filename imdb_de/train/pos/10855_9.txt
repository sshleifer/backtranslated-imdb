Looking back on the last 28 years (since my first encounter with the show), all I can say is that once you get it, it stays with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) annoyingly exaggerated, 2) underproduced 3) unlikely characters. A year later I was able to capture the entire series from the beginning and was quickly entangled in their bittersweet story of human error and prospects for happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the outdated production value is now hard to master. But I still think about the show at least once a month, with a vague, tearful eyes that longs for simpler times ... By the way, I'm a married man ... (for all, think this is a show for women)
