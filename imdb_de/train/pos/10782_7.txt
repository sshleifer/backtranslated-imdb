Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated person with an interesting moral attitude to sexuality. He has no problem meeting naked dancers, but when women have sex with men, he loses it. He believes that when women actually have sex, they lose all sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty." So he saunters through the Hollywood Hills to sneak lovers from afar, and finally shoots the men with a riflescope with a powerful rifle. <br /> <br /> The apparent main reason for the existence of this movie is to enjoy sexually activity over and over again. The "story" comes rather later. This will make many happy heterosexual men quite pleased, as we see enough lengthy scenes of nudity (the ladies here look terribly good sans clothes) and sex to serve as a big dose of kicking. Of course, when you see a lot of them through an area, the horror factor increases considerably and illustrates the compulsion to voyeurism. (On the one hand, Mike peers through the scope for several minutes before finally pulling the trigger.) This is underlined by terribly intrusive, if somewhat atmospheric, music on the soundtrack. A taste for lurrid trash cans will, to some extent, be enjoyable. It even contains a lesbian tryst that confuses Mike and makes him unsure how to react. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but is provided with an amusing ironic twist. It's a kinky and twisted rarity that, if nothing else, will definitely make some viewers stick to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
