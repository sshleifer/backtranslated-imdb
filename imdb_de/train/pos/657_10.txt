La Maman and la Putain must be seen as a film that is related to both the time of publication (after 68) and eternity in many respects. True, the actors do not "act" ... It's true, they talk a lot ... But what they're talking about is what makes life worth living ... or dying. The very long monologue by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. Not easy to translate accurately. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being male and female (in this case two women). And in my opinion, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
