I've seen it in a posh cinema where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban. The show I attended had a wealth of African-Americans and made the difference in the audience's response between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, the white people were eager to laugh or laugh nervously about the funny spots - and there are many! - because they would laugh "Blacks", while the Blacks also remained pretty silent, because many could not laugh at the whites. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I was Asian (and therefore did not belong to any group) and had a great time watching this rap culture satire and her egos / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophies. The cast is talented and does a great job in becoming one of the featured characters. The songs are too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best pseudo documentary films, including "A Mighty Wind".
