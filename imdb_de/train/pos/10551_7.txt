Sit, type? Nothing is the latest "What if?" Celebrated by Vincenzio Natali, with David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One has relationship problems, was canned by his job (because of relationship problems) and the police want to get him (because of his job and his relationship problems). The other type is an agoraphobist who refuses to go outside his home. He is hit by an annoying girl leader who calls her mother and claims she was molested if he does not buy biscuits from him. Oh yes, the police are after him after the scout's mother called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if you could make it all disappear? That's the whole premise behind Nothing. The two fools recognize the police, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the street, everything? disappear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept, I thought. I also looked at the time, 30 minutes had passed in the film, and I had an hour in the film. Could the two actors do this work and talk for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes is a long time and in places of this film clearly dead air. But the two actors, who have been lifelong friends with the director and the director, have such a large repertoire that it is fun to pay attention to the dialogues and to increase the awareness of the two. There are many supernatural elements, but it's more their reaction to those elements that make this movie worth seeing.
