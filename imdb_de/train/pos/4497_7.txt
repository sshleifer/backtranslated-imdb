I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted in the late '90s. Recently, I had the opportunity to see all three parts via Netflix (which is a handy service, by the way). All in all, I liked this carefree, sometimes genre-requested miniseries. The story of a younger man falling in love with an older woman seems to work, and the actors are doing well. Yes, there are a few romantic clich√©s about running in the rain or a train station to say goodbye, but the characters have a chance of being discovered so it does not look cheesy, as if it were a Tom Hanks vehicle or something similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separate son separated at birth, does a great job with someone who is in love head over heels, and the ebb and flow of desire and rejection throws the show into a true prestige. Personally, I think the series could have been made with two episodes, but that's up for debate, I think. There seems to be a sequel that should arrive via Netflix tomorrow.
