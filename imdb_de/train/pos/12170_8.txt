Romantic comedies can really go either way. You will see one that is really juicy, and you think you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it may be too boring to interest you. Or maybe you see one who does everything right, but does not make you smile. Romantic comedies are hard movies. They come with many expectations for them, and usually, whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the movie anticipated your expectations or that of the guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course If you have a girl next to you and you're a guy like me, it probably does not matter if the movie is good. You have other things in mind. For you, I say, "Go and get her, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "See _A Guy Thing_". It makes a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows that you are entering this film with expectations, he does not pretend that his man, who just wants to get married, meets his dream wife and it's not his wife! "Plot will make everyone happy, Sure, maybe you like it, but it may not sound true, or you may think it's cruel." Guy Thing_ covers it. "What _A Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best cast that I've seen in a long time, so if you do not have the main line, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br Whether we're talking about the veteran big and small screen veterans, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan) O'Brien, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety) or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman) speak of a crowd of very talented and capable actors who know exactly how to exploit the film's inspired character, steal the show over and over again Piece always still frame with an energy and a joy that are rarely found in romantic comedies these days br /> And that should not distract from the actual romantic penetration and the stars that carry it, because it is very sweet and terribly well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) touches the young professional whose life is out of control, and Selma Blair shows an unobtrusive brilliance in the portrayal of the aspiring social and sophisticated career woman every man wants to marry for the guy that is actually. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie's success, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the right time, and she wears it well. I do not know when since I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that made it so easy to fall in love with her. Of course it's all in the close-ups, the voice and the subtle smile, but it's magical and it's one of the main reasons why we even go to the movies. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stile's somewhat unusual sophistication would be lost unless the rest of the cast is so unbelievable in its classic simplicity. This is a movie that paints a broken world of incompatible subspecies, bringing it down to make you laugh, and then comes through with a lot of heart. <br /> <br /> A Guy Thing is a movie You've definitely seen it before, and the filmmakers knew that when they settled down to do it. Since Shakespeare we have not seen any new romantic comedies. The relative success of this or that is completely dependent on the execution of the classic story of the boy meets the girl. A Guy Thing embraces this with a certain meta-cinematic edge and often takes the scenes into the absurd to give the audience the opportunity to recognize the powerful emotions and ancient tools of action that are in play. <br /> <br /> The album even manages to ridicule the more traditional structural notions of gender and gender that are at the heart of any romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there get a kick. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I will not spoil it, but if you try to explain to your friend why the pharmacist and the clothes shop employee are among the coolest types in the cinema, I suggest you say "It's a guy" and go with it ,
