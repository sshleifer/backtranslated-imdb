Several posters have quoted Renoir, who expressed his desire to make a film that Ingrid Bergman smiles in front of the camera. The short answer is, we would not all, while the harsh reality is that only a select few have to do so. At this stage of her career Bergman could not be arrested; In 1949 she left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, fell in love with the director Roberto Rossellini and was never happy. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but after Renoir had made it for Renoir, she was back where she belonged within the year, and an Oscar for Anastasia. This is one of three films that Renoir shot in color around this time, and overall it's better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even at French Can Can. Renoir probably guessed that Bergman could get away with so much success for a few leading woodmen, and Renoir chose two Doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, both in solid mahogany. The storyline is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is content to give it a one-time look and focus on recreating his father's paintings after the lineup. In its pastel colors it resembles another film from the time of Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not bad. All in all, it remains a pleasant little thing that shows a beautiful and charismatic actress.
