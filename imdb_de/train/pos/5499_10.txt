I had no idea about the facts of this movie. Recalling this situation, I accepted the information presented in the media at the time: a confused event about a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if anything has ever been made of this caliber. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr. Chavez, but everyone who came to the picture was important and, in the end, the reality of this entelechy was that the people were overwhelming. Many thanks to Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
