I always liked this John Frankenheimer movie. A good screenplay by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why this was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His strict direction and attention to small details make the difference, he has even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that this is the last good movie Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor did a great job. Clarence Williams III has achieved all publicity with his scary performance, and he's also excellent, but I really thought, Trebor sting. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of the movie as others, but it's an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actresses. What can you say about a movie in which Ann Margaret was drugged and raped? A guilty joy, to say the least. Vanity has a sloppy role and a very young Kelly Preston appears early. A classic exploit thriller that should not be forgotten.
