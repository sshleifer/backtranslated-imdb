Although I was too young to remember the first series in the series (just as a baby), I was replayed on television in the late '80s, just as I was interested in the war and all its aspects. My grandfather first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, telling stories from his days in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and seen many TV series about the time of the Second World War with mixed opinions. British TV broadcasters are generally very good at producing them, as The World At War can attest to with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend titles like "The Nazis - A Warning from History", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain at War In Color" with its accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​have a very high standard. The World At War is by far the best and can deliver again and again, despite its age. There will always be new revelations about the war, which obviously will not be included in the series. Of course, the Second World War took place on such a big screen that making a series with EVERY detail would cost more time and money then any other, even if such an obligation was even possible. What I think I have to say to those who think that it does not mean everything is that The World At War can not do that as a series, but it certainly can make you go on researching - and making it enjoyable , It certainly worked for me: I now have a very extensive library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes and CDs. Also recommend to anyone who has temporary interest. The series was so well done that it would be difficult for them to disagree that it was high quality programming and very informative.
