Allow me to conclude here: I have 3 children aged 5 to 10 years. I think a trip to the theater is a success, if no animals speak. I have seen most children's videos at least 72 times in our collection. I can tell you when the movie is reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the over-18-year-old sex joke in El Dorado, and the tragic mistake of ending Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. I could probably make Nemo from Storyboard's own memory. <br /> <br /> Why do I support the one child of mine (it varies) who suggests this title for the family movie one evening? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
