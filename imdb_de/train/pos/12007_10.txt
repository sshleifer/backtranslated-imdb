This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen. I drove to St. George with about 150 people and we saw this movie in the visitor center of St. George's Temple. No one had dry eyes in the audience. There were also some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the captivating music and reenacting the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about Joseph and the rigors of the pioneers. After all, it's part of American history.
