So I'm home to mirror channels one night, and I come across this man, who wears heels and make-up and stands on a colorful background on HBO. Of course, I made a double take and decided that I would watch for a while. I did not change the channel until it was finished, it was so incredibly funny. The next time it came on, I made sure it was shot so that I could see it over and over, and it's one of my favorite pieces I can watch. For the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not sure what to think, but he quickly convinces them with his incredible humor and wit. While many stand-up comedians are interlocking in my mind, Eddie Izzard is one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to the current events. His show stayed with me afterwards. I went to Italy all summer and all I could think of was, "Italians are always on scooters," CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See it. You will not regret it.
