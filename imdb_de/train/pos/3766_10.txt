Visual creative epic of inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film has neither the alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic spectacle. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I am not an advocate of the idea that an important movie must be serious, non-commercial, or deal with questions. Even there are many films that match these characteristics that I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is certainly not one of those movies. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positively charged, childish energy. This movie does not reflect reality. It is friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a nice combination of time and place to live! Besides this music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I've always liked the cinematography and sceneries of this movie. Especially in this point Bogus Journey far surpasses his prequel. The effects are also good, and I think most of them are very good without CGI. I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. Surely it is "just another Hollywood movie" from the point of view of some people. But I think that's a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word about the soundtrack: The whole band and orchestra music fits very well in the movie. The sound design is not lacking either. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get that track from Winger from the scene station, who builds the bill and builds robots in the van. I love the unorthodox camera work at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me say this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very resourceful! It's much better than Battleship Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. It's Citizen Kane, Apocalypse Now or Chris Markers Sans Soleil Absolutely Superior ... ... It's Even Better Than Total Recall ... No Way !? So yes! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made. If you refuse to argue, you are guilty of "artsy-fartsy behavior" or you might like Terminator Salvation (which is the bigger self-defense) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not the better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! It is not!
