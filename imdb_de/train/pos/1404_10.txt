HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror movies of the last decade. The signature is original and the main picture is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes to his mind. Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933. One of the most exciting horror movies of all time. The action is intense and the goose bumps are true. You could actually jump if you see it in the dark on a stormy night. The cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. Everyone does an extraordinary job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret of making someone invisible. After animal experiments, they go to human tests. But somebody has to be the topic. Caine becomes invisible voluntarily. But when his team is unable to re-emerge, Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge for a classic into the next century. In SCARY MOVIE 2 this film becomes the basis for a parody joke. He grabs you by the neck and will not let you go. The first 45 minutes are slow, develop the characters and show how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then turn the sharks into a crazy, invisible man. And then you turn the water into fire and explosions. Repeating a killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
