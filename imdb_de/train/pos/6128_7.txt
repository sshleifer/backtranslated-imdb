Yes, that's a horror of the B-Class. But at least the producers, directors and actors do not pretend that this movie is a manna from heaven. The plot is hackneyed, a psychotic serial killer on the way to execution is splashed with genetic acid that makes him a snowman. The snowman a. J. Jack Frost then assassinated to find the sheriff of the small town who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to make do with limited special effects, most of the money seemed spent on the snowman costume. Particularly difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan gestures (shots where the camera moves away to obscure the details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie and should not be confused with the eponymous Disney movie. If you do not allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone, parents should not let their children watch this movie. This movie has two celebrities. 1. The beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played her first major movie role. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth a few times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke ever. The joke is so bad that the directors credit the joker on the credit list.
