Some people may call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I would say it's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film is successful in showing the plight of immigrants in the United States - currently in the face of recent debates. The film tells a parrot telling a Russian immigrant custodian (Tony Shalhoub) how he searched America for its original owners and tells several stories. There is the older woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom he is friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very successful movie. I do not usually expect much from this type of movie, but this is a treat. I definitely recommend it. With Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
