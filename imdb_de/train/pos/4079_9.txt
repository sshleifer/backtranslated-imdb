I saw this movie for the first time when I was about eight years old (on television "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved it and was broken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was fascinated by the story and the characters, but above all by the haunting and beautiful music. It was the original English version I saw - sometimes mistakenly called "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually distributed by Ghibli itself and only by Streamline), which unfortunately is only available as part of a ridiculously expensive laserdisc box set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I have the feeling that the release of Disney was partly spoiled. The voice output is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as the "Streamline" dub or the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead role. You've made some pointless changes, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and adding dialogues. Worst of all, I feel like they've ruined many scenes of intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships, for example, was originally silent, but was troubled by Disney's feeble demand that music be played when no one speaks, which I find annoying Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows away the latest animated films, and I highly recommend it. The plot is simple but captivating and the movie has a flair that is unfortunately lacking in most modern mass market animations.
