This is one of three movies from the 80's that I think they were unfortunately overlooked at the time and unfortunately were still overlooked. One of the others was Victor Salva's Clownhouse, a movie that is dreadfully overlooked by Salva's legal / sexual issues. Another would be Cameron's Closet, which seems a bit underrated to me - not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that just stay in your brain longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years later, I saw it and still paused while something I could have seen 6 months ago went into the ether.
