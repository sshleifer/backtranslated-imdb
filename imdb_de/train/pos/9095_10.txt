A charming, funny movie that is rated solid all around. I recently saw a screener of this movie at work. It was so nice to see this movie in contrast to all the crappy horror movies I see every day. So much so that I thought I would write. I'm not sure if this movie will hit theaters, but I hope it is. It's a nice movie to see with friends, it's a charmer and has some funny jokes. The acting was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf), the direction was pretty good (not a movie that needed to be overdriven), what really makes this movie stand out is the typeface, and the chitchat between the characters is smart and has a nice one Rhythm As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice these things! (I'm a dork).
