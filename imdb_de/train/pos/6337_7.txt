I've been fascinated with tornadoes for over 40 years, since my fifth grade teacher, a Texas native, told tales of teenagers he had seen in his youth. Fortunately, I've lived my whole life in the mid-Atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as those in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in New Jersey Last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was around, Dan knew most of what he had to do, and he probably learned this at school because I know that tornado safety is an important issue in parts of the US where these storms are more common. However, the characters in the film have done two things, some of which believe they should be done or are safe in tornadoes, but are not supposed to be made or are insecure. <br /> <br /> When the siren sounded for the first time Dan and Arthur walked around the house and opened the windows. People have been asking for it for years, but Tornado security websites are now against recommending it. In addition, people were shown who hid in a motorway underpass. This method was made popular by a video from the early 1990s taken by a TV crew during a relatively weak twister in Kansas. For the heaviest tornadoes, however, people can be sucked out of these underpasses. This happened during an outbreak in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> The tornadoes in this movie were hit in the fall, which is not an ordinary time for them. (Another encounter took place in late September.) They traveled from northwest to southeast, while most of these storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northeast. This is not so unusual. A famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 1990s traveled in that direction (as did the one involved in my other encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the movie should have been shot in the spring. This film was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event of 3 June 1980. However, it was still a captivating story.
