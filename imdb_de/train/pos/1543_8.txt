I remember watching this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I would like to revisit it - does anyone know how to get a copy? As far as I can remember, it was a particularly powerful movie, especially the scene that stands out from the horses with gas masks. Besides, I can not really remember the story, so I want to take a look at it again! I've searched the web, but can not find a copy, which in my experience is unusual - maybe there is no DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. I would be happy if someone could help me. Thanks in advance for your help. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
