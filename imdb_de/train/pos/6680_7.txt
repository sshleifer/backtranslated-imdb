That was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about strange balls. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, though a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superhero wannabees. The most outrageous was Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee Herman", who is famous. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, flashy colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining, light comedy with nothing but silly characters that all heroes like Superman, Batman and Spiderman want to be. However, they have talents in foreign areas that the real heroes do not (and do not want to). It's stupid, but you know it's going on. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie that you can see in installments and do not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one that is so hectic, so take a break here and it's okay. The language was tame so even children could enjoy it. In fact, I can not remember being scolded here, except for the guy in the theater next to me who kept saying, "What a stupid, damned movie." I thought it was two hours of fun, but I would rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
