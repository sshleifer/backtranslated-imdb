This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but also made some good films, including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. In a London that can only make Hollywood, atmospheric, but by no means with reality, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD like I'd never seen before, and as a great admirer of Bette Davis, she wanted to see her in a role that was one of her early big roles applies. So I bought it. She looked good, but I'm sorry to say that her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the biggest movie actors, do not make a mistake, but here she has one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was not as cruel as the cockney accent of Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins', but just short. <br /> <br /> In the other main role was Leslie Howard, and he did it brilliantly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. The supporting actors get along well. Worth seeing, despite the vocal gymnastics of Mrs. Davis.
