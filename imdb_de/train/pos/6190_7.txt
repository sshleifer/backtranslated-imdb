Fay Grim is the sequel to a story begun ten years earlier by Hartley's Henry Fool. I have not seen the previous movie and I do not know if that's a good thing or not. I can only watch the current movie for myself. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's style of filmmaking is something you either like or dislike. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an atmosphere of spicy, intelligent parodies that made me and many spectators at the Melbourne International Film Festival laugh. For the first half of the movie, it was relentless and ran off with staggering straightforwardness. It's a kind of humor that is missing in cinemas, and a welcome relief to the thoughtless teen comedies that pump Hollywood like pancakes into an international spy / conspiracy thriller. Whether this was the intention of Hartley or if he ran out of ideas is not clear, but I think a bit of editing or rewriting to reduce fifteen minutes of film would have kept the film's original dynamic. The performances were generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum who had the most screen time. Safran Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played good supporting roles. The visuals of the movie were nice (in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it very much. If you like Hartley's previous work, you'll probably like it.
