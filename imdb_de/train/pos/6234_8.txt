This is my absolute favorite of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very smart. Not to mention that this movie contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; I put all my eggs in a basket and let's face music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire. That's why I think he'll always have a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental Cr * p, but I'm a woman, so get over it all) in this whole movie he gets me 8/10. The choreography was great and the fact that Lucille Ball is there makes it even more impressive.
