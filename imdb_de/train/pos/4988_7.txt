Man's Castle is located in one of the settlements built by Jerry on vacant land and in parks known as "Hoovervilles" at the time, named after our unfortunate 31st President who got stuck in his administration during the Great Depression. In this movie, it is said that a man's house is still his castle, even if it's just a cabin in a Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a cabin and the truth will not tell this man to work so much even in good times. But in a part typical of Tracy, before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco and began a series of classic roles, he plays a hard-nosed mug that hits Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things of Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of depression on both women and men. Women had some additional burdens when women had difficulty finding work, women had twice as hard. And they were sexually molested, and some went into prostitution for just a square meal. Spence asks Loretta Young who is facing such problems and does not ask her in his castle. Pretty soon, though they are in love, though Tracy is not the kind to settle down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had something special because Tracy and Young had a fierce affair while filming Man's. Both were Catholic and married, and at the time this was an insurmountable obstacle to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. <br /> <br /> Walter Connolly is also a kind of father figure for the entire camp in the cast, Marjorie Rambeau, who has gone through all the pitfalls that Young might encounter to steer clear and Arthur Hohl, a truly despicable one Guy who also has young in mind. Hollow brings the storyline of Man's Castle to a climax through his plan. <br /> <br /> Man's Castle is a bleak look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie escape for those trying to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
