This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling and saw him twice in two days! The film is unique in its humor and visual representations. Both are great and in no way inferior to Natali's other (more serious) movie gems Cube and Cypher. I've become a big Vincenzo Natali fan since seeing Cypher, and everything he did is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very sympathetic to this film are those of David Hewlett and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors I both like a lot. Cool are also the X-Box Dead Or Alive Fights (you can even see Dave playing Halo) and Andrew's fantastic guitar solo, among many other things. All in all a great feel-good movie about friendship. You have to see that!
