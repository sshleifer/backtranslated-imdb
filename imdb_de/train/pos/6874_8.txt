A series of vignettes, most of them spoofing 70s television, but also some disputes with the government and American companies. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers," is not particularly funny to me, and I do not know what's parodying. However, some of the others are absolutely divisive. I especially like the cooking show segment. Most of the bad words I know are used in the movie. If you turn against the frontal nudity, stay away.
