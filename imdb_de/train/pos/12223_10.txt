I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-nineties, and I've seen it a lot since then. It's a big mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school graduate in a Californian town whose younger sister was tortured and killed by classmates by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how smart she is, and they decide to work together to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this case. True Crime feels very "true" or genuine to me. I read a report in a newsgroup in which someone wrote that the total suspension of unbelief is there and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. The filming locations are direct and author / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after watching her photos of Tony). I wish Verducci would make more films. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie that is more like True Crime. 10/10
