War is hell. But this World War II documentary is Heaven. <br /> <br /> This series is not only a breathtaking, almost exhausting look at World War II, but also a poetic masterpiece that clearly and grandly tells Laurence Olivier /> <br /> This series of documentation defines the genre. It is undoubtedly a long one, but you will all enjoy it and want to come back more and more. (I have the series on DVD and probably watch the series three times a year.) This is really an impeccable piece of film. Apart from Olivier, the veterans hear their best stories. Whether it's a real fight or to find a pig to slaughter, so they can have something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll see it now (again, my ... 11th time).
