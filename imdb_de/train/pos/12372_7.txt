The Sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father, and I have seen it many times since then. It always manages to entertain me while it's also scary at the same time. The flashback scenes really did it for me. Cristina Raines' dad is running around scary, with the two spooky women who always send shivers down my spine. it is your typical good against evil, but at least it manages to be entertaining. The end that I consider to be one of the finest in horror history. There was a lot of shock and tension when Burgess Meredith did his thing as Chazen and had me on the seat edge. The Sentinel has the perfect tension. We never feel completely comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know something terrible is always waiting for them, and that made things even more tense. This movie is often neglected by horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the better, and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her wooden moments, but mostly tall. She is beautiful to look at and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a friend, Michael. He had an immediate screen presence and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or little cameos. Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we find out is absolutely scary. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken are doing well, as the bumbling detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a deterrent scene that I will not spoil. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. The Sentinel is an effective horror movie that horror fans unfortunately neglect. It gives you the thrill and the anxiety you need to be satisfied. The view is worthwhile. <br /> <br /> 7/10
