I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience like loud noises and scary kids. They are usually lacking in originality and they are overly abundant. The only horror movie I like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well played and had a great story. But Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, possibly the scariest movie of all time, has accompanied and perhaps even surpassed him. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are ready to oversee a hotel. It's closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place had been persecuted and the last inhabitant had gone crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be alright, and he can use the rest to overcome his writer's blockade. After months of loneliness and silence, however, Jack becomes grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that drives him crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the scariest aspects of the movie is the sense of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge and always empty. It is also incredibly quiet when Jack's son drives his bicycle through the bare corridors. Jack Nicholson's appearance is also one of his best performances. He scares me and makes sure that I get out every now and then. My favorite scene is when he talks to a ghost out of a walk-in fridge. <br/> <br /> The Shining is in my opinion the best choice for horror movies and beats the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair witch project. It may be an oldie, but it is definitely a goodie. 8.10
