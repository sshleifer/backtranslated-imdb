This is definitely one of the best stand-up shows ever. JE. Eddie is so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years now and still rocking it every time. Everything, from his big, wide body comedy to the small remarks of the head page, is a masterpiece. You do not need to look further than this line: "The word cabbage." They say, "Erb, and we say, cabbage, because it's a f # ing h". Brilliant.
