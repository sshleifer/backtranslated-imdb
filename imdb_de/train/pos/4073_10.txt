Have you ever wished that you could escape your boring and exhausting school or work life and start a magical adventure on your own, with one of your closest friends by your side, face all sorts of dangers and villains, and solve the mystery of riddles? lost civilization just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you are not so much a fantasy lover, would you have ever wished you could just experience what it's like to be a kid again and not just care for a few hours in the world? <br /> <br /> That's what Miyazaki is all about "Castle in the Sky". Pazu, a young but very courageous and ambitious engineer, lives a rural life in a mining town until one day a girl named Sheeta falls like an angel from heaven and takes him on a journey far beyond the clouds. Meanwhile, they have pirates and military units the trace. Simply put, it's just the incredible adventure that every child dreams of at one point or another, and I can not help but feel my worries fade each time I see it. <br /> <br /> As it is Miyazaki's older works, which play an important role in everyday life, are not as visually spectacular or deep in his story as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it hard to say that each of these films is superior to the other, as all three of these films are at some point mystical and enigmatic, if not startling, especially for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not try so much to be an allegory of any kind, nor is it a story of the coming of age; It is rather one of the best representations of a child's interior that I have ever seen. The artwork is not only beautiful, but the children's perspective is just incredible. Whether it's the panning of the "camera" to see the giant trees or clouds above the sky, or the incredible high altitude feeling when you look at the ground or the ocean while you're hundreds of feet in the air, I can I'm just there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves have no complex relationship that suggests a need for hope, such as Ashitaka. San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, who one day literally fell from heaven into his life, from the beginning the absolutely perfect person for him. As the film progresses, more and more of its true adventurous childhood spirit is expressed in friendly words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they a delightful reminder of who I once was, their friendly friendship never fades away throughout the movie and keeps getting stronger until the last frame. That's why I fell in love with both of them more than any other couple from Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is an easily accessible movie. No matter what kind of casual movie you are, here you are sure to find something. Riddles, action, drama, comedy, suspense, science-fiction, romance, even Western ... everything here, almost everything people are going to the cinema for (except perhaps horror). That's why I can easily recommend it as the first Miyazaki movie. It is perfect for those who have no expectations of having already seen the incredible strangeness of some of his newer works. <br /> <br /> Even the end of the film, which was translated into English, conveys the feeling of yearning for the discovery of a kind of lost civilization and kind of soulmate that could not be found in our earthly life. "The reason why I long for the many lights is that you are in one of them ... The earth is spinning, carrying you and carrying us both, who will surely meet." Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to finish off Joe Hiasashi's excellent grades, but this is the only one I've ever seen, a touching love song and an inspiring dream. I'm close to tears, as if I'm just listening to them. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" is not the most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work by Miyazaki, but it's absolutely perfect for what it should be: a true childhood fantasy vision and one wonderful escape from reality for all adults who wish they had the same wonderful imagination they had when they were just carefree kids. Lean back, relax and love what it is.
