It was easy and yet so nice. I think the whole feeling of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been shown very finely. It had a bitter lobster in it. The fact that most actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and realistic. There was also a "documentary" side of the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls who were forbidden to watch were passionately listening to the soldier, who should keep an eye on them and transfer the game. If you are an Iranian and the familiar cheering and dancing on the streets is after a won game, the national pride will satisfy you !! If you are not Iranian, you will still love it!
