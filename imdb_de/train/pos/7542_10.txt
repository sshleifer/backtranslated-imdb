This movie does not fit well with some, but is a must. I'm glad somebody finally started to discuss how African-American couples made a name for themselves in the communities and how many of them tried to stay there while "other" African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a spike-lee-joint ... You have an African-American (Danny Glover), who is HARD The traditionally white legal professions in the US has worked through the 70s. Like ANY American, he moved his family to be compatible with his upward mobile status, but forgot that there were still a lot of problems. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at that time were the maids. One who owns a house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mixing started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is said to "meddle," so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do. And when the man thinks he and his family are "in," another African American comes in next door, who came in because he won the "lottery" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes he does not want anything with them because he does not want the neighborhood to think they are the same. He is of course of a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto" and should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this film shows is the great pain this family brings and how they lose themselves. They ask the question where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. It shows how much you have and how much money you have, you can still isolate yourself from the real world and help the people around you. It also shows how these African-American children fall into the trap of "mixing in" such neighborhoods to adapt to the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, mind you!). They laugh together with the jokes, do not know that they are the joke and do not know ... why. No matter what race you are, this movie shows how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and each other ... all for the sake of customization. All in all, because you feel that you have more money than others, it automatically makes you feel better - and you forget the struggles you had and the ones that came up behind you. <br /> <br /> NOT again for everyone. But take a look for yourself and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
