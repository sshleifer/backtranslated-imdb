This movie is not for everyone. You are either smart enough to get "it" or not. Fans of sci-fi films who do not take themselves too seriously will definitely enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who appreciate parodies and parodies. Everyone I recommended this movie enjoyed. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you will probably enjoy them. The voice characterizations are done in a winking manner and the one-liners fly fast and furiously.
