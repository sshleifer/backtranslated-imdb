Steven Spielberg, who took a break from his escapist run in the early 1980s, directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. It's unbelievable that this is the same woman who starred in films like "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that can easily be included in the curriculum of Black Studies and Women's Studies - no, that they SHOULD BE SHOULD BE. There is a scene that is perhaps the greatest editing job that has ever been on screen (you'll know when you see it). I can not believe that this has not won a single Oscar; it could be Spielberg's second-best movie behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even associated with it). With Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
