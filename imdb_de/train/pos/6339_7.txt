The part of The Grinch was designed for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. Since I was not a big fan of him, I was worried, but pleasantly surprised. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little girl I've seen on screen for a long time, and she showed maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even moved to tears once! I have the book of Dr. Seuss never read, so I did not know what to expect, the humor was pretty dark. Overall, I really liked the movie (apart from the songs!), And I would recommend it especially for families.
