Critically-planned, but loved by the fans, the movie has become a classic. The mixed Surreal movie, recorded in John Lennon's home with live recordings by Marc Bolan & T.Rex among others, is not only a must for anyone who likes Marc Bolan, but also provides a fascinating insight into the era. <br /> <br /> This was the time when Marc was fiddling around with people like Ringo Starr of the Beatles [the director] and even finding you a short spot from a Reg Dwight, the Bashing The Ivorys in an amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda with her use of glitter etc], Mickey Finn and even the actor of Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden, as Marc leaves the dining table and crosses his legs in front of him, putting on a string section and knocking out acoustic versions of classics like Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended !! FIVE stars [of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
