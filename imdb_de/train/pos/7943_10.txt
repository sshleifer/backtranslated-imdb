I love this TV series so much. It contains animations that are interesting and beautiful. I can not believe that they have cut off television and have never figured out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the BEST TV show ever. I know it's too late to hope that they will start the series again. I am really glad that I can look at them. I have it so much. <BR> <BR> It's about a woman named Cybersix, she's not human. She goes from Adrian Sieldman, a teacher at a high school. Now Cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she is dressed as a man during the day. At night Cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von Reicher is the one who created Cybersix, and when he realizes she's alive, he uses everything to capture her. > <br /> If you have never seen it, you should download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did you cut it off? Some people have problems. but I am glad that I could see the 13 episodes.
