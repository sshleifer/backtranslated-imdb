As a kid, I loved this game. I played it tens of times in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I played Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how many times we played, it never seemed boring. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that these even existed. <br /> <br /> You play as an ex-cop Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who left the forces to fight the evil in their own way. In a rundown and corrupt city led by the evil Mr. X, there are eight levels one can work through. Beating all bad guys and the end-of-level boss is a lot of fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you could put bad guys in the holes in the river. You even have the chance to become the right hand of Mr. X at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" where you become the head of the syndicate. How this is possible is a mystery as you destroy the syndicate on the way to Mr. X, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has really great music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro has done wonders with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main themes Level 1, Level 4 and Final Boss are outstanding pieces. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I'm proud to have this on my console forever. But even with Streets of Rage 2, the first is a bit dated. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but nice backgrounds presented in a comic book Panel progress that adapts the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to reach and difficult to lay down. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> Far inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Baddies often go away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially annoying for the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Badger models are often repeated too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Persistent Appeal B-
