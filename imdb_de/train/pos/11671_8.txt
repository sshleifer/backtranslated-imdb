Against All Flags is the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements the adventure fan can hope for, and more, because in this case the girl in distress is not well in need. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her best, leading her enemies against the social norms of the time. Anthony Quinn rounds out the three best actors as the ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and proves to be a smart and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan "Against All Flags" is a must. It's not quite in the same league as some of Errol Flynn's previous work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), but it's still a very entertaining move.
