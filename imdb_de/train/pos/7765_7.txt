Douglas Sirk directs this overreacted drama on the unfortunate wealthy. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different views of life. Kyle is the female son of an oil magnate. Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; But it's Kyle who has the means to get her off her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the nymphomaniac of the city and wears a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be the one to clean up the mess of the Hadley. Ambitious with claim a bit over the top, but the stars make it a movie to see. Malone impressed me the most. The cast is completed by Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
