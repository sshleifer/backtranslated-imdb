Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any other film by Hayao Miyazaki, brings the audience the joy of storytelling. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel like a kid again; it's just magical. It's a crime that took so long to get it released in the States, but now that it's here, give it a try! And stay with the original language. Dub has changed my impressions of the characters, which should be avoided when translating a movie (or a book, whatever).
