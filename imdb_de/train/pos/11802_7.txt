This is not the best bigfoot ever made, but due to Nature's recent standards that got lost in the worst movies and are mostly shown on the sci-fi channel, this is a quality issue. It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are also some practical F / X that I like. Overall, this movie is worth watching if you're a fan of B-horror / sci-fi and need a correction. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and no sequel to it, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than you would expect in a movie like this, and the direction is more than sufficient. Expect a bit Lul, as the characters are "developed", but you know things will improve. If you are watching a DVD, you may want to skip one or two chapters.
