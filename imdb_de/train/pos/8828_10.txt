I was so happy that I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to find. When I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action short at the Academy Awards, I was so happy that I actually had a movie that I was. The plot is pretty simple, the director, writer and Nacho Vigalondo Star tried to find a reason why people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number, as they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made short, well cut and the actors do a great job. And the last shot of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
