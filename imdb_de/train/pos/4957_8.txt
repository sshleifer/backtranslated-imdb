10 ITEMS OR LESS was made on a tight budget by director Brad Silberling in just two weeks, just a small film shot in Carson, California, which gives the impression that the entire story has been improvised in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate enough to pair experienced actor Morgan Freeman between his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different perspectives that can enhance each other's lives. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - and part of the comedy is that he's portrayed as an actor who has been unemployed for four years and is looking for a place for a little "stuffed film" to get back into the flow of things to get to. His "role" is to be that of a market manager, and he is dropped off on a run-down market in Carson, where he meets, among others, Scarlet, the girl at the disputed 10-item or less-cash register. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry over her husband (Bobby Cannavale), who is sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and the lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two have teamed up after a few common problems and go on a "road trip" that causes each of the characters to grow out of each other's presence and life story. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, to say the least, but it works very well because of the tender connection between Freeman and Paz. This is one of those little films about human relationships in which it is prone to be vulnerable to change and exchange. It's definitely worth a look, and this is a DVD with touching, informative and comic-like features - a pleasure to look at. Grady harp
