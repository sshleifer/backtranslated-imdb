Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with virtually no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW delivers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays a former ex-naval casualty in Lebanon who has only $ 5 left after declining a job on an oil field for his bad knee. He plays in Red Rock and is considered by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not so threatening - but still evil) for a man from Texas. <br /> <br /> He pays him to kill his wife Make it look like a burglary. Only when he's there, just to check her. She offers him twice to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to leave the city with his free money and leave the sparring lovers behind. But a series of mishaps and setbacks cause him to move back and forth in Red Rock. Ultimately, this leads to a run-in with Lyle from Dallas (a cheeky and somehow likable Dennis Hopper), the REAL hitman from Texas, who offers help without knowing he's complicating the plot. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a big release, so most viewers found it on video or cable TV. If you look at it that way, it may seem like a TV movie, but it's bigger. The smooth, slow direction, the atmospheric score, and the howling desert wind would have turned it into a great movie in the movies, but the best thing you can do today is watch the DVD on a big HD TV. The film's only drawback which I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dike hairstyle. I certainly would not fall in love with her, but if you assume that Nic Cage's character is a lesbian militant, then accept it anyway.
