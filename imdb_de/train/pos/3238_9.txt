The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes show a kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress trying to arouse a romance for her colleagues: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode shows an old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to drown him in dignity. Remarkable is the way the old couples have to defend themselves against the humiliating practices of the hospital, and their loneliness is in contrast to the "routines" of the hospital crew (despite occasional empathy). Compared to the Altman classic, this film may be less professional, but definitely a great piece of art.
