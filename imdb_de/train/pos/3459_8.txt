Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was a legendary columbo rogue. The first "right" episode of Columbo, followed by two standalone pilots, "Murder By The Book", is not far from the classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of a thriller partnership. His partner Jim is the talented one, whereas Ken has no talent but the gift of wit and a literacy ability. Once Jim decides that he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken plans to kill Jim. Apart from being a new plot, this is actually the implementation of a murder act originally intended for one of their books. It does not take long for Columbo to find out that Ken is the killer. Unfortunately, another murder must take place (Ken Romanzen and then kill an important witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with "Murder By The Book", but that's not terrific. I would give "Publish Or Perish" the distinct advantage: Both episodes include Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "Publish Or Perish" is a part that is tighter and more unpredictable. However, this is still a great episode.
