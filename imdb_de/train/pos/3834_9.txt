A great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and frightening, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet), maybe mixed with some Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add a few nights on earth, Angel Heart and a bit of indigenous Pi (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - that should at least be the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for avant-garde and / or surrealist cinema (as I am) you will like it. If you expect anything but a movie full of action with an average storyline - try your luck with another storyline. <br /> <br /> In short: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and that's probably the # one reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
