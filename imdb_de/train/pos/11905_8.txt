William Castle is notorious among the horror fans as B director of the 1950s and 60s. His gimmicks, cost reduction techniques and unique vision are legendary. No wonder somebody (Jeffrey Schwarz, who has done countless documentaries) finally takes the time to dedicate a documentary to his greatness. This is "Spine Tingler: The History of William Castle." <br /> <br /> I had a general understanding of who Castle was after watching some of his films over the years. I did not know anything about her personal life, goals and ambitions. This movie has really sharpened the man and valued me more for his dedication to the film industry and his contributions to the horror genre. The film features Castle as a rival to Alfred Hitchcock, with Hitch the artist winning praise, while Castle is the carnival market, gaining cult recognition but far less respect. He's an icon for all second-class directors, so it's not surprising that John Waters is prominently represented here. (Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have considerable roles.) <br /> <br /> It was his gimmicks that made him famous, and the documentary requires great effort to explain them. The rudimentary 3D version of "13 Ghosts" (see separate review), the buzzer in The Tingler's Seat (see separate review), money-back guarantee for "Homicidal" ... watching the movies outside the theater "We can judge them by their content (which I personally still enjoy), but we can not fully appreciate what the audience once felt. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is when Castle changes from a cult director to a Hollywood producer. After acquiring the rights to "Rosemary's Baby," he is taken to a very special location to discuss the release of the film. Hoping that he will direct, he is relinquished to producer to make room for new director Roman Polanski. At first disappointed, this proves to be one of the best ways of his life - a hugely successful film and a job he excels. Who could better control the purse of the wild artist Polanski than a pinching lock? This was to be his crowning glory, though the film is unfortunately more associated with Polanski than Castle. <br /> <br /> The rest of his life is over, and we are personally considered by his daughter and niece. In the whole line everyone seems to have only praise for him. Somewhere along the way, he certainly annoyed one or two people, but you would never know it from this movie. And I find that statement - this is a celebration of the life of Bill Castle, not "E! True Hollywood Story." Fans of the genre would think good of getting a copy of this work. <br /> <br /> I would personally recommend to buy the William Castle Collection, which contains not only these, but eight movies of Castle by specifics. Even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how Black was personally influenced by Castle and tell Castle's daughter Terry about her experiences with the various films and remakes. It's almost a whole new movie.
