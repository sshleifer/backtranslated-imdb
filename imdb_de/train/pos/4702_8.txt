If this film proves only one thing, it is that Keaton is a comic in the heart, was and always will be, even if he dodges bullets, goes to the electric chair and ends up in jail at the wrong end of an information line. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" proves even more. In the 1980s, the ZAZ guys (Sugar, Abraham, Sugar) were the pinnacle in the world of genre parodies. But there were several pretenders on the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") Heckerling, with a staggering number of television writers, is trying to get behind the screenplay (go and check). <br /> <br /> This slap-happy slapstick parody of the 1930s cops and gag movies throws off films with just about every cliché and even adds a few clichés that did not exist at that time And not only the always reliable Keaton is the Johnny of the title, but also funny guys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and so on. Every other actor in Hollywood happens to be in the immediate Environment came. You will be surprised how many faces you will recognize. I know, I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? When they start, they approach you quickly and furiously like a machine gun. There are too many to start with, crowned by a crazy title song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to be careful when to reload. And they have to reload a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, they seem to have fun and I laugh a lot. In the end, however, there was enough time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - usually not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy, nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and ready for a serious " Dangerously "laughter. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Look at "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be "Bastidge".
