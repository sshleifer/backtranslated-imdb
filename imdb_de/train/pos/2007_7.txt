My personal opinion is that this film had no real storylines to the first vampires of John Carpenter, but I do not care that I loved it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He really drove me crazy and thinks he was the person you would never believe was a famous rock star. There were some bad things in this movie. As with the story, there should be more to the movie. There should be a sequel to the movie that followed the story of the movies and they should keep the same main characters in all three vampire movies. I liked the clothes people wore and the environment they chose in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was and not New Mexico. with the mud houses and the old fashion churches. I was a bit confused with the vampires and how they could walk in churches, but it was cool that they did not follow the Dracula vampire rules.
