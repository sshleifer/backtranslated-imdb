There were a lot of things against this movie before I saw it. <br /> <br /> At first I was a typical high school graduate, in a Shakespearean class that I did not really like, let alone half understood! Shakespeare would be no more than incomprehensible without me pouring my entire concentration into his almost coded plays ... encrypted with his extremely hard-to-understand language .... and then I would not get most of it br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful that I actually understood the language during the performance. Now the script followed the letter in that movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespearean class. And here my mind opened and I understood it. I doubted myself when I almost saw the movie! But lo and behold ... When it's performed, Shakespeare only comes to life. This version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in high-budget movie style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and played amazingly by Brannagh and Cast, somehow ... I understood what's going on. What was said? The language is great and passionate. It allows more raw emotions ... if words can not describe something, Shakespeare's words may. <br /> <br /> I still find out that Fist of The North Star (animated, English dub) is the greatest movie of all time. No movie offers more pure entertainment. But for a movie that comes close to Fist, Fist is really amazing from that position (what Hamlet did - it came close). Awesome. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br/> <br /> It was all the more surprising that I appreciated Shakespeare. Impressive. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, really powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> This brings 2 trillion stars from an infinite number of stars. Yes / Yes. By the way, all the kids out there in a Shakespearean class forget it. You waste your time. You have to watch the games played. Only then will justice be done to them.
