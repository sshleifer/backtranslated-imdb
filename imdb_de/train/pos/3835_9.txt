This movie is incredible - it's like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decors, the everywhere swarming insects, the jumps and the surrealist dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It seems a bit to the films of David Lynch: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no action. It is more a sequence of surrealistic events, nightmares and meetings. That's a disadvantage. If the movie had a really fascinating story full of suspense with a captivating resolution, I would give it 10 out of 10 points. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the film an 8. Look for this DVD and you will be rewarded!
