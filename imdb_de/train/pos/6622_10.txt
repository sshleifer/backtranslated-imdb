I had just gone to a film screening during the short film festival Expresion en Corto in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a short introduction. The film turned and I was astonished from the first moment: a long, continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in magnificent black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not go into details, because I think it's worth watching a movie. The sci-fi story may be average for many ... it was really good for me. The action is great, the camera can fly anywhere and I mean everywhere. Things that you can not do or see are achieved in a wonderful way. The performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong mark. <br /> <br /> Well, the thing that I like is the animation. 3D graphics look 2D. A BW comic comes to life. The details on the backgrounds give more texture than if they had been made by hand (I am sure that was the case, but when the angles change, you will see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer of the show talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director is brilliant, but he may be quite inexperienced, as he only has a short film in his CV. So many people had a true trust in them. They started their own studio from the ground up and since they had to face the challenge they put to them. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater is superior for the final look of this movie, in his opinion.
