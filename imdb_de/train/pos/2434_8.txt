I've often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all the issues surrounding his identity (in this movie, we believe he's the ghost of a dead child because his home is a graveyard plot) and the disturbing message this movie brings. Maybe Casper was meant more as a moral game, or the famous studios wanted to break new ground in the reality cartoons. <br /> <br /> IT'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well-animated project - no doubt. But the development of the plot with the fox (who becomes Casper's friend but finds a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Recognize the famed studios - they fight death with respect ... but the heaviness The image of Casper's grief is quite vivid and disconcerting to children (though the resolution does offer a happy ending, though I will not reveal the end) and the violence is quite steep even for the 1940 standards. <br /> <br /> This could be a good caricature for parents helping to kill children - but I would not put them in the VCR to make a naughty cartoon break.
