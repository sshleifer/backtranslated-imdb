Ralph and Mumford, who feel inappropriate in their own country, are deceived into an ignorant Farmer by Synanomess Botch. Twice at once is the story of them, the characters they encounter, and their struggle to get things right. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice played by some of the best in the industry, this unusual movie hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process is similar to that of the "South Park" style is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation was about this style, I would swear that it's traditional writing instruments. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! You will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience!
