This is not a great movie, but I admire the writers and the director who have tried something different. The main theme of the film is destiny and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In a way, that reminds me of the movie SLIDING DOORS, even though seemingly random stuff is being replayed instead of just concentrating on a random event, and each one helps to come to a nice conclusion. Besides, a strange bald guy seems to understand all that, and he talks about it in a short scene - as if he's a kind of almighty being, but there's absolutely no explanation for him in the movie (like the two men fighting each other in the clock tower fight each other in the HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket only shows Audrey Tautou. This is evident in her success with AMELIE, though she is just one of many actors in the film and there is no lead role. The pace is fast, the acting good and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not rate it higher is that some of the characters were slightly uninteresting and I think the movie might have been made worse with a few minor squares.
