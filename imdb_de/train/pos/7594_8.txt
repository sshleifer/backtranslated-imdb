I do not know any stars or modern Chinese teen music - but I know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is laughed. For love, and it's a great mix of kung fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everybody looks like they've had a lot of fun - production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The abandoned orphan's conspiracy that grows up in a kung fu school and only then emerges as a basketball game (and love, and more, etc.) is great - that's fresh. Fun and incredibly entertaining. <br /> <br /> With great action and dialogue, this is simply a treat - for all ages - and for our money it was one of the best family movies we have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance. We were really glad that we made a good sports comedy film.
