This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and very attractive to those of us who are not really "conformist" movie pickers. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies that are very appealing, but if you watch a movie that says "everybody else sees it," you know you're either a tween or not really opinion. This had a nice subtle sense of humor - though most people probably only looked at the obvious. The actors have brilliantly portrayed their characters, and I thought there was more "personal" personality in this film. Has appeal to both children and adults. Esp. Nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual clues and drug innovations! A great movie that can not be overlooked on public consumption. This is a must buy.
