I loved this movie. I knew that it would be full of stock and stupidity, as in the original series. It was very heartwarming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar together again. Anyone who loved the 1960s Batman series should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave. You could say that the actors had a lot of fun, especially Adam West. And I bet he would have liked to jump back into his Batman costume if the script required it. I told a number of friends of this film who had decided not to look at him ... now they wished they had done it. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now this movie will be added to my collection. Thanks for the goodbye, Adam and Burt.
