The Dirty Harry series began with a very hard cop action and was relieved almost instantly for "Magnum Force". By the time The Enforcer rolled around, Dirty Harry was little more than a television series (just saved by Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry has finally returned to his roots. Maybe he went too long this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is making the first well-run Harry movie ever since Don Siegel made the first one, which helps a lot. Harry is a darker character again, not the nice policeman he's become. He can say things like "Go on, make my day" and really mean it. "Sudden Impact" is a real sequel to Dirty Harry. The Enforcer could never have been done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
