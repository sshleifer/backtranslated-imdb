Embarrassingly, I saw this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It is a story that every father or brother can identify with. One brother is a bit "wild", the other is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a bit too emotionless as the eldest brother, but Pitt is amazing and Skerritt is perfectly cast as a dad. The fishing scenes filmed in Montana are absolutely stunning ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The film follows the book with only a few changes to make it more suitable for a film format. Unlike most book-to-film stories, this one measures here. It's a perfect movie for those who want to spend a quiet night with a powerful and emotional movie.
