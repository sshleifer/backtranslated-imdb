OK, so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask? ... now you see and maybe it makes more sense. Hitchcock has never fused scenes better together. The movie blends scenes together from the start, and yet you do not get the scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie leads you through the many characters it tries to develop. They feel that the characters are showing you something out of the ordinary and will not disappoint you. Screenwriter / Producer Phil Hays's surreal life story, combined with an absolutely superb soundtrack, lets you think more about the 6 divisions in life than about the movie with the same title ... I'll look for more good things from this producer in the future.
