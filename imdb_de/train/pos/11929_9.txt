A trifle forgotten in this family movie is a business thing. At this time, in 1994, this film held the record for the biggest movie premiere in film history (and may continue)). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the "Angels" of the original film "persecuted" by the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake, they "haunted" the California Angels. <br /> <br /> The premiere was definitely at Three Rivers Stadium, where the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers (the Pirates) were now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere took place on a five-story movie screen in the stadium and kept (and maybe even holds) the record for the biggest movie premiere in history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all involved in the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
