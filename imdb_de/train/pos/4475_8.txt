The United States was still fighting World War II (the film was released between the VE day and the VJ day). In each studio that was worth its salt, either battles were filmed, in which fearless American soldiers defeated the enemy or Americans generally sang and danced. Technicolor musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of the day were just a series of music numbers strung together. The best available action has been inserted to fill the time to the next music number. I now have the feeling that the people who discussed this movie were all born after 1970. Depressed, how fast we forget it. <br /> <br /> This movie might be called "The Quest for Jose Iturbi", but now everyone wonders why. Allow me to explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to decorate a concert stage. He agreed to shoot some movies in 1942, but Hollywood was almost a decade after him. Iturbi was not only an outstanding pianist, but also a successful conductor. Iturbi has been a household name for more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early - and has no one ever noticed that the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who has produced the film and many other MGM musicals, attributed Iturbi the interesting American youth in classical music. Grayson's desire to play with Iturbi in the film was not unlike real life at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he gave many concerts on military bases). Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra a great singer, but when this movie was made, Sinatra was just 30 years old and had only been with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi has been a worldwide sensation for over 20 years. <br /> <br /> And because of the lack of conspiracy, the Americans did not need a plot. They were tired of the war, they were afraid of their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed luck and hope and the certainty that it would work out well in the end. They needed music and a smile, joy and romance. This and other films delivered exactly what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lecture. Dancing with the mouse aside, the best scene in the film takes place between Sinatra and Iturbi, each of them "ignorantly" complimenting the other's music. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniards conquered more America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon taken together, please visit my website www.joseiturbi.com, on which you will find a plot summary, excerpts from the movie reviews of "The Day" and pictures of this and several other MGM find 1940s musicals as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
