If you were ever sad that you could not get a movie on DVD, it was probably "Delirious" you were looking for. How often do you laugh when watching comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in his prime, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie was a big part of his Inspiration received. Now that I'm older and have seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I recognize two things: All STEHLEN from Eddie, while Eddie loved LOVING Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. He was something that had never been seen before. He was everything we ever needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old? but once he was king, and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
