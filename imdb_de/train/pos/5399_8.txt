Gosha's last great movie of the 1960s. Gosha, a determined stylist who gives his films a great purpose, has teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (famed by Zatoichi) to produce this devastating indictment of national national loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" is the word that the loyalists scream at the Emperor as they murder enemies or "traitors" to the cause. Katsu embodies his character's simple-minded fidelity to a manipulative politician, all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions the politician is called a "traitor" and becomes a murder target. <br /> <br /> One of the best photographed films of all time, many recordings are incredible compositions of form, color and light. The fighting scenes are common and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his pictures. Beautiful and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan could be very helpful, you can fight through the movie without it. The few drawbacks of the movie are the music track, the length and occasional chewing of Katsu. He has a drunken scene that is far superior to a movie, but actually a very accurate portrayal of a drunk. Downbeat, but one of the great Chambara movies.
