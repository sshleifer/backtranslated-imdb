This movie may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for television, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film and its actors have received several awards. It's enthralling, intriguing and will completely absorb you. People willing to risk their careers to save the lives of future victims would be a chase when it comes to fiction - but it's supposed to be a true story. I highly recommend it.
