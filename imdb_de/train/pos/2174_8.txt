I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film that was translated into French in 1930. Although someone else's voice has been dubbed over their voices, this remains an impressive feat for Louis Brooks. The fact that their singing voice is dubbed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps us to calm purists about the synchronized deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see her in a resort with her macho friend Andre (Georges Charlia) and her friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs: We see her changing into her swimsuit in the car. Lulu is very free to show her body, and that does not go well with the annoying other. If Lulu is considering applying for the title "Miss Europe," we know that a happy ending will not be at the bottom of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on men who love beautiful women. We see many bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them. In the center, however, is the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from past eras, then you should try them here. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie lovers will easily know, but once you see them, you'll be intrigued and want to know more. Also, check out the "Pandora's Box" if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful when publishing the US Cinema DVD. I do not know if its projection speed is correct. Many scenes seem to be shown too fast. Maybe they were shot like that. I dont know. But since this is the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing that one little bitter pill.
