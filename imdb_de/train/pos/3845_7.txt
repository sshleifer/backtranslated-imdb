Unconventional, slow, entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, even for them it will be difficult not to appreciate the various imaginative sequences contained in this film or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance. Throughout the film, Verhoeven maintains a fascinating ambivalence and plays with the meaning of the hero's visions. Unfortunately, everything is blurred in the last 5 minutes, and the unsatisfactory ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
