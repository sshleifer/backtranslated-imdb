I had the privilege of seeing this movie at a preview screening years ago, and in front of the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local television station looking for commentary on the movie. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "awesome, just awesome". I like to think that I can articulate myself a bit better, but at that time I was a little incapable of doing so. <br /> <br /> The story is intriguing and thought-provoking, and acting is top notch clients This film was the first one directed by Terry Gilliam for which he had no handwriting. Back to Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over "Brazil," Terry had achieved what he most wanted; the "final cut". Terry is a master craftsman and each shot is like a beautifully designed painting that has been carefully and determinedly designed. It is only justice that such an individual should be unrestricted in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, there are still restrictions on such arrangements. <br /> <br /> The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this movie is simply mind-blowing, though most bonus features are not listed on the box. It includes a director / producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90-minute documentary about the movie "The Hamster Factor and Other Stories of 12 Monkeys". It tells of some creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of bravado, when preview screenings were badly tested and impressed the team with feelings of self-doubt and desperation. Fortunately, they all decided to make little changes to the movie and bring huge success. <br /> <br />
