This is a fan-made short film purporting to be a preview of a new movie connecting Batman and Superman! It's a kind of movie that fans love and watch in places like ComicCon. It was made by the same person who also made BATMAN: DEAD END and Sandy Collora apart. Of course, the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was done on a tight budget and for a fan movie that's unbelievable. I was particularly impressed by the very captivating Superman - he was not a fool! If this was just a preview for a real movie, they would have taken fans from here to Omaha to see it. Well done.
