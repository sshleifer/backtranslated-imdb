I read the negative comments before I saw this movie and did not stop going and started to look. I admit that I had to rewind a few times because the film is incredibly complex, complicated and rich in detail. This is a good thing, but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, unsatisfactory sex and general violence that replace the development of action and character. In fact, what a welcome departure, I'm so used to not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and plotline; the kind we analyzed during my schooldays. This requires an actual mental involvement of the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to "All The President's Men" in terms of generic topics. That is to say, it is a mystery about the serious misconduct of elected officials and persons who have enough influence over officials to essentially "possess" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike "All The President's Men," this film seeks to give some characters their true personality. In this sense, the film is a character study like "The Negotiatior" with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this movie, her characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense. The plot, however, depends on their characters' ability to cooperate, trust each other, and ultimately join forces against the corrupt police force. There is more fire in this film and the specific plot is different, but generically there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the town hall requires a lot of concentration. In fact, I was impressed by how parallel it was to the political scandals of the past and present that I saw in my life until Watergate. The thing is, the public knows something is right, for sure! However, it is difficult to follow the details. This movie is not nearly as complex as real life, but it is realistic for life in its complexity. I think that's one of the reasons why previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, if you know what you will see and live up to the experience, it is really excellent! I have seen it 3 times in a row! The acting is great and the direction is impeccable. The weakest link is the accent of John Cusak.
