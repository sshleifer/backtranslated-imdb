This is not another burning view of the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events taking place in a small street in Berlin and some of the people involved. The movie begins today in New York City, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) mourns the death of her husband and their family members are gathered by her side. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade). She travels to Germany and is looking for the 90-year-old woman who tells her about the events in Rosenstra√üe. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo takes in all the Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse, even though they are In order to have immunity to be married to Aryans, a group of women would wait outside for nine days and call for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and has no chance, but she meets 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann) and makes contacts with the Nazi officers so they can do something. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who has been making her first feature film for almost 10 years after working on television and this is clearly not one of her provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered Directors in Europe. This is not one of the Nazi films in which we see horrific acts of inhumanity of the Jews, though some serious treatments are spoken, but rather a retelling of a small event that means life and death to the people involved. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but it simply wants to shed light on a small but true life event in a historical period. Part of the movie strength comes from the actors and there are some good performances, especially from Riemann and the young Lohde, and it's always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a key role. This is not a great movie or something that will change your perspective on World War II, but given the fact that innocent lives have died because of the events that occurred, I think that reason alone is important enough to tell this true story again.
