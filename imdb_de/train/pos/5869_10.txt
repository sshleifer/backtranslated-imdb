Having just seen The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece, the movie Jacknife had to fill big shoes. He has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie as well as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here as well as Kathy Baker. But this movie belongs to Ed Harris, who offers a powerful, emotional and effective performance. The film is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes that was obvious to me. By that I just mean that for these one or two scenes I had the feeling to see a stage play. That was not such a big deal and does not really diminish the movie. I really liked it This movie is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They are about a similar era and have similar themes, but they are two very different films. I thought the Deer Hunter was great, and I also think that this movie was great in this, what makes it so great. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
