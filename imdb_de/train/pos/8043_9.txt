I've heard people say that this movie is boringly boring. I do not think they saw the right movie. This is not the prototypical action movie, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the beginner and his mentor, which is all about killing people. This way, it works great, with terrific performances by Berenger and Zane (who does not stroll through the movie as in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with that Action towards the end - a lot did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the structure of the rest of the movie. But watch Zane's face as he panics while Berenger does the dirty work.
