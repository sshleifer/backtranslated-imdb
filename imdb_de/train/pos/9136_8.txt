This is NOT a bad movie than some reviewers, and as the summary on the IMDB page indicates for this movie, this is true. Why? First, the fact that the filmmakers were daring enough in 1984 to pose as one of the elements of the domestic violence issue is one of the main points of criticism among critics complaining about the plot! Second, the musical climax without the plot of Prince's film relationship with his abusive father would not work as well as he did. Therefore, the reviewers who say that only the music is good have again missed one of the points - WHY it is so good ... because all the music in this movie has a background with pleadings that make the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For first-time film producers and directors that's just not that bad! There are far worse films by experienced film people !! And finally, the reviewers who call the music "good" have missed the point. Take a look at the range of Prince's stylistic musical treatments, diversity, music experience and stage performance - truly unique. They go musically to where no one else went in the eighties, and with a style that can be seen in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: which costumed elements came first, Michael Jackson or Princes?) In front of the eyes, the Prince in this movie, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction"). As a sum of its parts no bad movie at all.
