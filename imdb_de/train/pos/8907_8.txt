I saw the movie on demand at midnight the other day, not knowing what to expect. I had heard about this movie but never really had any opinions. <br /> <br /> I have to say I was impressed by what I saw. I was really freaked out in some places and I definitely remember jumping up to my seat a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The blob looked scary. Now I look into a jar and wonder if it will get caught on my hand. Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the film. I also liked the old man in the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a horror movie of the 50s, this was very well done even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
