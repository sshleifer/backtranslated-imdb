More than just a "children's film," "Holes" examines how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know it or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a detention center where he has to dig all day, he discovers some things about the camp and his personal connection to it. Flashbacks tell us that some things are closer than we realize (you'll understand better if you watch the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other performers: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
