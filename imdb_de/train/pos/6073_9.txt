My college professor says Othello could be Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know if I still agree with him. I bought this video version of the movie. At first I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was completely complicated and worked very well on this editing. Surprisingly, he did not direct, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. not that it's a British vs. American edition about it. If we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses who deserve it abundantly. In addition to other Shakespeare tragedies, the race is also discussed here. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and showed the complexity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona wholeheartedly, he is weak with jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's a great scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the end. It's just worth seeing. I think they edited many of the lines for 2 hours, but they always work on Shakespeare.
