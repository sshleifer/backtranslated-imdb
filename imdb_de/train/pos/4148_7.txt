Let's make one thing clear: This film does not try to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie with three major female characters (I can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler of SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, as charming as ever. The story is simple: The three girls were "losers" in college and are still behind. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not even date a blind guy), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton") ... I caught that a few minutes later ... me am a bit slow, OK!) and Dracht has a gay fianc√© (Seth Meyers from SNL, weird). You need to prevent the Senator's "uncool" daughter (always sweet Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") from embarrassing her in the spring break. Of course, they have to go to take care of them, and it adds a bit of joy. All in all a light, simple comedy, quite short and very pleasant
