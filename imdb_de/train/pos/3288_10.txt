This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my favorites, it's really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who later became director of Candyman. He made a good start with this movie. <br /> <br /> The film about a girl named Anna, who suffers from glandular fever on her eleventh birthday. She pulls a house out of her notebook on a scrap of paper and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Every subsequent dream she has is altered by the presence of what she adds to the picture. In her third dream, she meets a boy whom she believes has created him, called Mark. She becomes friends with him and their relationship grows stronger, the darker and scary the dreams become. Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a great actress and it's very strange that she should disappear after just one movie and never be in something again and again. It really gives a great performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also ace. Similar to Broken Arrow, the music is spooky and mysterious. It is a pity that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
