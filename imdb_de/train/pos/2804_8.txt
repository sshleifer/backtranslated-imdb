The title of this movie almost made me look at him. Since I'm not a fan of Manchester United, the mere mention of Beckham was a little outlandish, but I left my prejudices behind and I'm glad I did, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film flitted with me without looking at my watch, and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked East is East, you will love this movie. OK, so the plot is nothing new, and the classic storylines are included in the movie, but everything happens very funny and with a touch of fresh air. The movie moves very fast and keeps the audience entertained. The occasional funny moments are a good giggle and not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
