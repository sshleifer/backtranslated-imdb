I'm glad someone made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises - charming, amusing and gives you that good feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very resourceful, but there are millions of ways to tell the story, and they have not all been used yet. The cast is perfectly chosen, although Scott Wolf does not look like an eight-year-old father, even if he wears a suit. So the sparks are in the right places, the support of the cast is a lovely support and although you could probably predict the entire movie, you do not want to change the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
