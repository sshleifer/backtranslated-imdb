I know that I should like this movie, and I do a lot of that, but as others have mentioned, it is a bit long in the pliers. I also found that the raging hormones of the entire male crew are a bit annoying. It's a wonder they do not even gasp and howl the moons. I have to say that the movie leaves me cold altogether. It's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the movie. On the plus side, the effects (in addition to the cartoon monster) are just as big as the effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think he would have been as popular as he was / is. The second half of the movie picks up speed as soon as we examine the forgotten devices of the "Krell". Whenever I've seen this movie, Krell still makes me scratch my head to know who or what he was. Based on what was produced at the time, "Forbidden Planet" is far beyond the average sci-fi film of the time, alongside "This Island Earth." Being filmed in color also adds to the enjoyment. Certainly a classic for itself, mistakes and all, and rightly so.
