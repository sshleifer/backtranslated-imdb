*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane and Romola Garia. Director: Woody Allen. Immediately after working with Johansson at Match Point, they return to a Corky, crazy and funny comic book ride for Scoop. When a student reporter (Johansson) discovers a deceased reporter (McShane) when he comes into the materializer of a lame mage (Allen). The scoop of the new Tarot Card Killer in London, who may be the dapper Peter Lyman (Jackman); While Sondra and Sid play detective, Sondra falls in love with the handsome man who would be a killer. Allen has finally achieved a goal, not as good as Match Point, but definitely more fun. I have laughed much more than expected, one must see one of the years
