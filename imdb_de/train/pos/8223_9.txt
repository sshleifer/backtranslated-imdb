When I saw this movie for the first time in London in 1958, I was overwhelmed. I had never seen such a movie before. It had a strange, hypnotic effect, unlike the films I had seen before, and it left a lasting effect. <br /> <br /> I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. The interaction is certainly amazing in its power to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this was converted to DVD (in the format Region 2) and in the original language French, I would like to know something about it can be bought.
