I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw that. But after I saw it, I realized what a funny man he is. This HBO special shows him teaching the New York University's film student "American History," and the man was just phenomenal. It was fun at almost every major historical event that took place not just in the US but in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that questioned whether what I accept as an infallible true story is truly true. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching Mr. Wuhl mix useful information with great comedy and learning was more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in history and would like to know what his / her beliefs are.
