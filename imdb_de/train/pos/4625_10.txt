Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and adorable movie I've seen all year. It's a prison program somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the inmates have practiced and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting to performance, and we learn some amazing things about these men, all of whom are interested in the most serious crimes. Truth is in fact more alien than fiction - if someone tries to turn that story into a feature film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing it is real makes breathing breathtaking - in the truest sense of the word; I gasped loudly when I heard of a crime committed by a particularly gifted criminal. It's like an erratic episode of Oz and all the more entertaining as the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
