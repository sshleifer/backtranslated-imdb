In the 1950s, when an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious "space dust") was cushioned by special electronic collars, the young loner Timmy in Fido (Billy Connelly) finds a friend of the recently acquired family domesticated zombie. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes a Timmy replacement, whose real father is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his family-clad, hot-headed wife) Carrie-Anne Moss), who was mentally scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). <br /> <br /> However, Timmy encounters difficulties. when his lazy buddy's collar wobbles, and he attacks and kills an older neighbor. Will Timmy be able to cling to his new friend with the authorities on Fido's track, having trouble with a few local mobbers and with his undead homemaker? <br /> <br /> Fido is a refreshing version of the entire zombie game. It's a thoroughly entertaining, delicious, dark comedy that should appeal to everyone with slightly twisted humor. It's a stroke of genius to transplant the romero zombie verse into the 50-year-old town, and the result is simply one of the most original films dealing with the revived dead theme I've ever seen. <br /> <Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of being inducted into the Undead Movie Hall of Fame alongside Day of the Deads Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman. It's not often that I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so good that I've actually fueled the big blue egg bag! The rest of the cast also give praiseworthy performances, with the young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Moss Moss earning special mention: Ray, for bringing such a young man a particularly safe turn, and Moss, because she is damn tasty! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I've seen this week (the others are the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead) and to my surprise, it's also the best , Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent that must be seen in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to IMDb on 9.
