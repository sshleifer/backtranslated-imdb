I'm writing this after seeing The Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When her father dies, two strange brothers meet at the funeral, and after discovering them, the brothers die of AIDS and embark on a heartwarming journey of reconciliation. The two leading actors do an excellent job of producing the gradual warmth and respect that builds throughout the film. However, I have a problem with the movie - while the dying brother is ill, he does not look that way. A person with 0 T4 cells would look pretty sick - not even a make-up job to make the actor look sick was discontinued. A little problem, but that makes it a little less realistic. Still, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie, and if you have a chance to see it, do it. I hope for a DVD release in the near future!
