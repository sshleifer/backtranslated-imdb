Director of duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto's "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of Yamamoto's 1999 movie of the same name. I doubt I'll ever get a chance to see the original, so I stay with that comment. What is Meatball Machine? A simple, up-and-coming, pretentious industrial splatter film with great make-up effects and lots of blood. It's not something you'll end up writing books for, but it's still entertaining to choose this kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the familiar story. Boy loves girls, but she's too scared to ask her for a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl is infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a deadly cyborg. Boy, in turn, turns into that thing and goes in search of saving his love. Will he succeed? Who condemns this, as long as there is bloodbath and death, I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The storyline is simple and relatively clich√©d, but it does its job well enough to bring the film into a bloody confrontation between the two main characters. There is a subplot that focuses on how the parasite that infected the girl came into her life. And yes, fortunately, it also shows more violence. I am happy. Acting is what you would expect from a movie without splashing. It's not exactly painful for the ears, but it's not very good either. <br /> <br /> The movie's main attraction besides violence and blood pressure (as I have not mentioned enough yet) are the cyborg designs. Made famous by Keita Amemiya who works on creating fancy creatures and costumes for movies and video games. The Necroborgs, as they are called in "Meatball Machine", look amazingly detailed. Without the use of CGI, Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal that are painfully grand in their appearance. Can transform various body parts into cool weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, lightning-fast shotguns and so on. Although it is easy to see how cheap the film is, Necroborgs are an A-movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man", mixed with "alien", all in a low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's an extremely entertaining movie that ignores modern special effects and proves that the Splatter genre is still alive.
