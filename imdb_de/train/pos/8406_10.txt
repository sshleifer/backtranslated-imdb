In 1979 I was a boy of 12 years. My parents had just got the home fund, which was pretty new in our neighborhood. As a 12-year-old boy I saw breasts on TV for the first time. I will never forget the joy of these times. Rennvans, the total ass wipe with the nastiest van, the waterbed, the herbal smoking, the hot '70s chicks, the love of my Chevy Van song. A complete movie with all the memories you could hope for. I own it and enjoy it about once a year. When I watch this movie, I want to get my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a straight line, going to the park and chasing a few babies with feathered hair. really great memories of the youth!
