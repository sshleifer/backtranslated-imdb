Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as a title character in this funny little Gothic Nose Pin. She accepts a position as secretary to a London shareholder (imperiously played by Lady May Witty) and her creepy son (the nasty and annoying George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens in a mansion by the sea where she has never been seen before. Witty and Macready call Marian and try to convince the staff and the surrounding citizens that she is Macready's crazy wife. Of course, this couple can only plan sinister acts, and although we know that Julia will eventually have to escape from their trap, director Joseph Lewis creates great excitement when it comes to answering the question of how to do it. <br /> <br /> "My Name Is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish it from any number of films that came out at the same time, but I was surprised how good it was despite shoe-string budget and B -Movie pedigree has held together. There are moments when you may be at the edge of your seat, and I found myself truly rooted in Julia when she discovered the plan under her feet and outwitted her kidnappers. With every other gothic thriller, the heroine would have fainted, screamed and wobbled, waiting for her hero to save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was when the heroine used her brain in this movie and figured out how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> B +
