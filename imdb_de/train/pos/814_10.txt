Thanks to Kevin Smith, some geeks are running around saying that the return of the Jedi is not good because it's fun to see them. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked Jedi's return until someone in a movie by Kevin Smith made a negative comment. Suddenly, people look at you as if you have some kind of illness when you say how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith has ever considered that he thinks the man even thinks of denouncing him. This movie is a lot of fun! It's as great as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the opinions of Kevin Smith! His are not correct! <br /> <br /> And the Ewok song in the end has decided! I bet people do not even like "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will set you all on fire!
