This is an excellent movie with a great cast and great acting. I do not get tired of seeing it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glovers character and Kevin Kline, Simon and Mack, brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his behaviors are effortless and that you would often encounter. SO it is a very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the most powerful scenes in the film is at the beginning of the film when Simon reaches the scene where Mack's car broke down. The film also has a strong message and is no different from the stereotypical message that carries a movie in which a person preaches to an audience his initiates. Instead, actors' emotions and situations convey an effective message that works best without words. And finally, Mary McDonell is as brilliant as ever.
