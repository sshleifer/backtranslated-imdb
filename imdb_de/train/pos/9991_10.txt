I found this movie hysterical. I've seen it a lot and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks was excellent. The cast was fantastic. I do not understand how this movie gets a rating of 2 out of 5. I loved it. I have seen other films of him and they were fun too, but this film is really remembered for its humor. I see that it runs regularly, but it's never enough for me. The people who played the homeless were also the funniest standards by comparison. Please open this movie more often. I can not see it enough. Leslie Ann Warren has been one of my favorites since Cinderella. I always thought that she was not really funny, but she loved to play her. She was very funny in this movie ... and she and Mel did a great job together. You should show more of his films on TV.
