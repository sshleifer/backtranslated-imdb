"Inspirational" stories about "triumph of the human spirit" are usually big distractions for me. The most surprising thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite my enjoyment. The movie is as predictable and clich√©d as possible, but it works. We owe much praise to the exciting performances of both leads. It is a perfect role for Cuba Gooding Jr., who is wonderfully reserved. We expected a lot from De Niro and he does not disappoint. He makes a dark funny portrait. The director George Tillman jr. Wanted to do an old style movie and come with a winner.
