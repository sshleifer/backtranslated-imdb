Ti% s and As *, many boobies. Some great characters, funny pranks, and well-rounded teen action in this by-product of the Amercan Pie series. It feels like an OLD SCHOOL. It feels a bit like Porky's for the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this piece a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Although the original cast is almost all but one, this movie is really entertaining. Let's not get too excited, you have to take it for the bubbly teen comedy it is, but it's what it is for. The characters are sympathetic and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. The fun and games are hilarious, with some things I've never seen in comedies, they make me wince, but at the same time they laugh, you think. Do not expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and get your attention for an hour or so.
