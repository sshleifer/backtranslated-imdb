A friend of mine recommended this film and quoted my vocal and infectious similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the film. I guess, to a degree, I can see that and maybe a bit more. I'm not sure if that flatters the presentation or not. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty unique piece of work, the only film this could be possible More than a cursory view would be true romance, not for the content or style of the film or for the pace of the dialogue (Whale Music is just so much more, so relaxed.) Instead, they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example, I recommend Hard Core Logo) and this movie in particular. It has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most likable guy, but there is something about it that triggers a kind of empathy.
