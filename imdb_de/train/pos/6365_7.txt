This highly derivative movie is entertaining to those who have not seen some of the more obscure anime movies yet. I enjoyed the most, especially after the rather shallow opening minutes in the museum (though the title sequence is very entertaining and contains some of the better animations). James Garner as Commander and Leonard Nimoy as King give impressive performances.
