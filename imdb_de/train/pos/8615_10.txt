I've been waiting for this movie to appear in Canada for a while, and when it finally happened, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course it's a very sad movie at first (and it was New Year's Day - which makes it even sadder) - but it stays with you. The next day, I thought about it again, because although it's something so emotional, you realize after a few days that it's such a beautiful story. How a person can be seen as connecting to so many people, but sometimes you can blind so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character saves the rest of them just by being there. And how they save her. It was such a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers the perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that needs a box of handkerchiefs, but stays with you for a long time.
