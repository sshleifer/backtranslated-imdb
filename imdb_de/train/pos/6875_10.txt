When I chaired the coffee house of our college, one of our responsibilities was to review groups and films for student activity. One of the best things in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that Broadway was shown in the cinemas, where TV monitors were placed throughout the audience, so that everyone had a good place. The premise was that the skits would change regularly - ala Saturday Night Live, to keep the thing fresh. They decided to turn it into a movie for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said it was the first time that Chevy Chase was in the movie. Watching him run naked, though the forest was howling. Like many of the reviews before me, it was Saturday Night Live before it happened. I highly recommend this video. I told my 13 year old son of Koko, the clown. He can not wait to get a copy!
