We saw this in my Women's Health Issues class to show how women are inferior in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I intend to try to get a copy of it. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to everyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this movie was exactly what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite the rating. This is a movie I will show my children. The professor in our class meant that the movie should be primarily about women too much, but this movie was more than that. It's one of those films that will be forever remembered and a favorite.
