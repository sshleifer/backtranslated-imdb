It takes courage to shoot a film about Gandhi in India, where he is not portrayed as a man who can not go wrong. This film shows how a Mahatma (at least in the eyes of his son) was not a decent father. <br /> <br /> The performances are fantastic, the cinematography fantastic, the direction fantastic, but the film draws. If the film was to be shot without any expectations at the box office, which I suppose to be a brilliant attempt, but if the makers had expected this to be a commercial success, the fate of the movie was the day they hit had decided on this topic, doomed to failure. <br /> <br /> In 20 years, this film will be remembered for the brilliant depiction of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this. And frankly, this is not the only accomplishment worth applauding. Shefali Chhaya is also great where Harilal learns of his father's death. No dialogues, no screaming, but a speechless reception of Khanna. His father is one of the most beautiful scenes ever shot in the history of the cinema. My dad is not exciting cinema at all, but yes, it's an excellent movie theater and a must see. Brilliant attempt ..
