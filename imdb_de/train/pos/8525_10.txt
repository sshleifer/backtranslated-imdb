To rate this movie fairly, you need to think about the genre it should be: children. They had more guidelines to follow to make this movie (which meant it could not go with the humor and / or language of the first), that he found everything that was in this movie entertaining and enjoyable. Sequels usually make me nervous, but this one has done pretty well. Knowing that it was not the star power of Fraiser, because George played the humor and I think Showeman did pretty well as lead. The plot, which is easy to follow and sometimes combative, fits in well with a younger crowd. If you want to watch a movie and hope for academy awards, this is not the case, but if you want to watch a simple, funny, energetic movie you would make a good choice with it.
