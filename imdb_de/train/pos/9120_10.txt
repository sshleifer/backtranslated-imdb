This movie speaks a universal language; You can relate it to the self, the community, society, or the world. It has a way not only to open up some questions, but also to search for and ask the right questions to reach this point of self-belief / ownership. The presentation of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us that must be recognized as a cycle of destruction, as a drag on innovation, creativity, and growth. The factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be made visible and addressed. The idea is definitely a film that needs to be experienced and not just viewed when it interferes with looking into your inner voice / conscience, it makes you feel as if you are just watching.
