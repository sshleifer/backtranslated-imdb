Maybe it's up to me and my perverted ways or the fact that I tend to be very sick, but I happened to have borrowed this movie in a very strange night. To my great surprise, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the overview on the back of the DVD box and read that it has been banned for 25 years and I thought I was prepared for anything it would offer. I was clearly deceived after ... well ... saw everything to make a long story short. I can see why it was forbidden, not just for such explicit sex scenes, but for the beast. <br /> <br /> As it is based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, a personal favorite of mine, it naturally tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening about a dream of a persecuted Duchess of one, whatever, hell was that thing - like a beast with a huge erection and a considerable amount of ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what it wants and the duchess decides that they like it, and they continue to frolic in the forest. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. There is so much more! <br /> <br /> We see not only interspecial sex, but also horses, the babysitter, who has a crush on the slave if she does not jump the bed to get her ... uh ... uh ... Contentment and the dreaming girl masturbates with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and enjoyable, but it took awhile for my dad to talk to me again after he saw it after I went to bed ... I was 15. Advice, though Watch this movie: Make sure you're the only one who knows you have it, and watch it with its curtains closed. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like these.
