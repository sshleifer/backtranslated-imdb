Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I actually saw it. The story was totally surreal, but still great! Anyone who rates and judges films should remember what the film is about. The same goes for First Kid, which follows a similar pattern. Certain films - like here - are aimed only at simple and funny nonsense. Such films can not be judged from the point of view of a supercritical critic. Of course, these films lack quality, they lack a sophisticated plot, often lacking in first-class acting, but if they meet their basic requirements, that's fine. I do not have this movie on my list of eternal favorites, but I thought it was funny, had some very nice sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
