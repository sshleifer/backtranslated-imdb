A great film that shows how people are associated with the common pearls taken for granted during the carnival. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, it humanises the workers in China, the owner of the factory, the pearl sales in New Orleans and even the night owls in New Orleans. What's most striking is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another fascinating aspect, and I only wish I knew how he came to the factory. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt, and the conclusion gives hope without people feeling alienated.
