I think that's still the best routine. There are a few others, like Rock's "Bring the Pain" and Allen's "Men are Pigs," which are hilarious. "Damon Waynes last stood" is also funny in a whiny way - but this routine is flawless. All the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just love the way he allows the audience to be totally self-sufficient and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who saw Jim Carrey growing up and saw a more relaxed comic, he's cool. Do not classify with Ellen and Newhart in a category, but something you can see when you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, God bless you.
