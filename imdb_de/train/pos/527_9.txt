It's no surprise that writer / director Michael Powell considers "A Matter of Life and Death" and his intriguing 1946 fantasy Emeric Pressburger as his favorite of their collaborative films. This colorful romantic adventure, released during the Second World War, would have just provided the tonic for a traumatized, recovering nation that needed a good upswing. After a series of other patriotic war films' The Archers made this their quirkiest, sharpest and most patriotic. British influenced by the preservation of British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly Americanized in its Baroque compositions, its technical inventiveness and its fine multi-ethnic occupation. <br /> <br /> Strangely another 1946 The classic "It's a wonderful life" opens AMOLAD to a big firmament, with one of those funny speakers preaching about earth and heaven and into what a great, wonderful world we are Life. <br /> <br /> Then he breaks into the interior of a British cockpit, badly hit, in flames and is already dead with the copilot. It sounds wrong, but the connection soon becomes clearer through the following events. <br /> <br /> The nearly five-minute switch between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy. Resigned to dying, Peter still exhausts a lot of strength, charm, and effusive confessions, and his heartfelt affiliation with June concludes with a mutual exchange of "I love you." <br /> <br /> Devoted to the magic of the moment, Peter escapes death and mocks his conductor 71, whose job it was to transport him to the "Other World". He is on the beach. Later he meets June while cycling and immediately adjusts the body with his voice. <br /> <br /> However, when they realized their mistake, the Supreme Court wants Peter sent back and the French conductor (Maurice Goring) sent to Earth to bring him back. But Peter is relentless to live because of June and Conductor's mistake, and intentionally guards his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and noble British delegates. The surreal process that dissipates after the announcement of the verdict on black and white in Technicolor may be a dream, but the final appointment in the hospital confirms the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> The summary, frame filling "The Stairway to Heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in black and white as he lifts Peter and his enigmatic French guard up and for the process giant statues of the potential lawyers of Peter crossed Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly lit color staircase provides the backdrop for an iconic image in the cinema - Peter and June solidify side by side, their astonished eyes are directed forward in the frame, their fate is sealed. <br /> <br The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June never gets soggy or verbose. it is treated with nobility and the perception that the couple is already fit for marriage and simply has to convince people of their love so that it can hold them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze the time and bodies of people, brings together many of their key moments by teaching Peter about history and his mischievous tricks, Peters' Top 100 Game Tricks book and his Coffee pinches cup. <br /> <br /> As visually as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, they have for the first time combined color with black and white. The latter have a cheerful quality when used for the sky scenes, and both are equally fascinating. <br /> <br /> The outstanding script is more than just an imaginative set, the dialogue sounds so immediate that it does not feel like it was written or executed on the screen. Amusing and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves the same recognition as the color scheme and composition. <br /> <br /> 1946's "Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that age it and are fresh and imaginative, even in this age when CGI nullified its artificial effects and probably it deprived of her emotional miracle. <br /> <br /> Other screaming changes would limit the need to reduce the average seconds for slicing and the inevitable request to shorten the dialogue to preserve the low attention span of most audiences. Powell conjures a spell that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first image, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical evolution of Peter's malady.
