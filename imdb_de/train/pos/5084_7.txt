I was surprised that '' The Secret Fury '' was a pleasingly good movie ... Probably because I had no expectations for this film ... The movie does have its storylines ..... I would say that one until the end of the movie could not guess who was behind the whole project ..... At first I thought it was Robert Ryan, who used the same method. Like "Gaslight," where the man is trying to drive his wife mad, but I was wrong ... The main problem with the movie is that they're going in a very different direction that did not give any hints at the beginning , I thought Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert wore their parts well ... And also Vivian Vance, a good character actress who steals scenes in this movie ...... Those who like movies, that keeps you guessing, will like ......
