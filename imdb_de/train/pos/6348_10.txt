Jim Carrey is good as always, and although there are some Jim Carrey Moments, it's definitely not a Jim Carrey movie. <br /> <br /> It's mainly aimed at kids and I could enjoy it as such a movie. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey film, so those who expected a comic comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has great moments and is a great movie for kids. I can not say that I loved this movie, but on the other hand I'm not his target audience!
