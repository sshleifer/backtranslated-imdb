This is an almost action-less movie that follows Jack, an insomniac that goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws itself out of a building, and often can not distinguish reality from hallucinations. <Dominic Monaghan is truly credible as Jack. Confused and frightened, but lethargic, and at times uncomprehending, what he sees, we follow him and try to find out what he sees and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce a talking dog and children suddenly appearing in Jack's bathroom and bedroom, without explaining how they got there (more hallucination), and you have an interesting, mind-blowing 43-minute Time.
