This must be the best adaptation I've ever seen, it's my favorite and I think it's very close to the book. What really makes this a must is the casting of the two leading actors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen brooding and tragic on screen, while Zelah Clarke as Jane is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is the young Jane Jane, who was educated at a charity school for girls in the 19th century and announces her services as a governess in the newspapers governess in the great mansion Thornfield Hall, to teach Adele the young section of the halls of mysterious and respected owner Mr. Rochester. Over the months, he falls in love with Jane and does some situations to find out if Jane is as in love with him as she is with her. However, there is a secret that still needs to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and if it does, the effects are devastating. This is a moving and well-played drama with beautiful locations and beautiful costumes and, as I said, excellent acting, especially by Zelah and Timothy.
