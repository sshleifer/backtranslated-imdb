This movie brought the Jerry Springer rapprochement into superhuman power. "Wild Napalm" is a kind of themed movie that I love. He thinks that prodigies in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film points out that every child prodigy is just a human being and no longer to be feared or worshiped as any other human being. This was a great comedy, funny and humane with this easy satire.
