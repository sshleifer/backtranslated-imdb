I was so entertained during this insightful documentary and waited a while for this to come through the whistles (my local video chain) and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / special interest article, but this was definitely a warm, honest and nostalgic image, if you like, look back on a teenager's life. The imagination of a child is fascinating, and this is where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous and thoroughly entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and his company have definitely come a long way behind the video camcorder productions of banks that are close to banks, and gay rings that make people gay at a glance. They all seem to be quite successful in their respectful areas, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. The DVD contains some additional trailers for other good documentary films and includes some notable productions by Darren, including Crazy News.
