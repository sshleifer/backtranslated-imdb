I grew up in Brazil and visited and admired the beautiful coast where the film was made. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings back to life the world of 16th-century Brazil, where Europeans have barely begun exploring the coast, which was still in a pristine state sparsely populated by various indigenous people strains. French and Portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand in the timber trade in Brazil. They negotiated with the natives, who fought each other for some reason. <br /> <br /> Mercenaries ") is killed by his own compatriots, but is able to escape and is held captive by a completely naked Native American tribe, and although he is a" slave "to the chief, he may, according to the customs of the tribe Living relatively comfortably for months until it's time for him to be killed and eaten in a vengeance ritual. <BR /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it depicts the villages of the natives and their way of life ( they walked naked and were cannibals), lovingly replicating us and asking us to recognize and accept life in that time as it was: in a beautiful garden of eden, life was messy, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and bizarre habits Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romanticized "noble savages" or "heroic explorers" here, it's only people who versa to survive in a hard world. <br /> <br /> The film is neither overly sympathetic nor repellent by the natives. From what I know about the subject, the plot is pretty accurate, giving the project a unique atmosphere: how many films have you seen about the lives of the Native Americans and their early relationships with the Europeans?
