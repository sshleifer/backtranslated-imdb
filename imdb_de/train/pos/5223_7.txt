It does not seem that this movie has pleased many people. First of all, not many people seem to have seen it (I accidentally came across it), and then, after the reviews and the rating, from those that have many, it was not much fun. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and charm, and though I did not think he was a great actor, I know he can be pretty crazy (I like his Mr. Jones). But this performance is very different. He is not pretty in this case and he is not charming. His character is totally different from anything I've seen of him until then - old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, in what for me his best performance so far, brings it out wonderful. I think it's a sign of how well an actor does his job, if you can not imagine someone else doing it instead - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. Gere was so good here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was good for me as well. I think I did not put Danes in that role, mainly because I think she looks too good. But she really does an excellent job and stays in top form with a guy, which is not an easy task. Strickland easily provides the best supporting role, in an area that requires a considerable reach of her. I think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's quite a feat. The story may not be all that surprising, some 8mm aspects, but adding the "Veteran Breaks in Rookie" series to the Who Dunnit and also (like the Silence of the Lambs) adds a sense of urgency by trying to save the girl and the upcoming retirement of Gere's character. All this is a background to the development of the two main characters as they help to settle down in their respective new stations in life. That's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we take care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were adequate. I could have done without the modern music video camera moves and editing, but then I'm an old Curmudgeon, and it really was not that bad, in fact, I think it helped with the atmosphere of the movie, which, as you might guess, is not a happy one on the whole. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
