You'll be amazed at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty will probably not fade at the first, second, or third viewing, but you'll be amazed by the characters that are so simple and yet intriguing that you can find yourself caring in an unexpected way, which may make you feel a bit childish because of the medium. Disney continues to hold the title of "Greatest Animation in the World" "A Bug's Life" is one of her greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments was the sexy "out-takes" added at the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these outputs, where the VHS cassette has an alternate version per band. The DVD also includes "Gerry's Game," a sexy little PIXAR shorts that was also screened before the movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the superior insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz," which in fairness is pretty good, but lacking in animation and story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, "Antz" is largely occupied by big names. "Movie" stars with some well-known "TV" star voices, with "A Bug's Life" being just the opposite, loaded with "TV" is the only exception with Kevin Spacey. The quality difference, however, is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can not be accused or surprised. If you work with Disney, you have done your job for you. This is the kind of movie that almost makes me wish I had children to share with. Do not think for a second that this is just a movie for kids.
