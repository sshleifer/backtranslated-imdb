As the Grinch stole Christmas, my heart stole immediately and became my favorite movie almost from my first glance. Now, eight visits later, it still has the same effect on me as the first time. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit are doing a fantastic job of bringing the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's guidance brought the story to life and Jim Carrey's typical energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show. Some critics of the film have claimed that they do not live up to the spirit or principles of the film's original story. After reading the original story, I can not agree. The film is about the same meaning as the original story about Christmas and its true meaning. In fact, it enhances the impact of history by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (You probably would not ruin the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it yet and you're one of those who DO NOT KNOW anything about a story until you you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br / I think almost everyone can relate to the terrible experiences of The Grinch at school. I think all of us at one time or another have been the most unpopular in the school, which has always been taken up. I know, I was ... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Whos naive idealism, who believes that no one can be all bad, was heartbroken. When everyone else had turned their back on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his girlfriend. If only everyone could have such a mindset. <br /> <br /> In fact, I believe that the only thing that might have made the movie a little better would be to further temper the humor and content of the adult. It was quite restrained, but something of that adult sense of humor (like when The Grinch first poked his nose in Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just did not fit into a story like this. So you can be a Christmas classic next to the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon a well deserved place as a must for any Christmas season.
