This movie was released 12 years ago and was a revelation also to people who knew something about the drag scene in New York. The textbooks about drag performance do not say anything about these trend houses. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Manual" with its flow chart that brings together Julian Eltinge, Minette, the Warhol queens and the club scene of the 90s - and the movie postdates - completely ignores the houses. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - that which comes closest to a definitive book on drag performance, quickly races past the film and does not provide the background information one would have expected of it. <br /> <br /> I understand from the film itself and various articles I found on the internet that this home system goes back decades. The most important movie performance of a house member before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the biggest missing part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of the life of 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during the shooting has a very dramatic ending. However, this is not the only movie about transsexuals that contains a real murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in her literal wardrobe, which only came out three years later. Of historical importance, but we still need someone who either writes a book or a documentary that offers more context.
