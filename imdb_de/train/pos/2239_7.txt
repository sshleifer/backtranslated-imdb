I think that this movie will only work for people who have all been rejected by the huge hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, I was too. And so I really love this movie. I especially like that all these flawless superheroes of LotR are so perfectly and irreverently parodied. The most brilliant is the counterpart to Gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless Besserwisser): Almghandi, the cowardice and the brain dead transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sauraus" from the GDR, of course) carries a simple bucket of eyeholes as a helmet. Aragorn's alter ego is another accident-prone idiot who tries to tape-repair his broken sword ("Ulrike" the legend). And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's counterpart) actually bears a strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
