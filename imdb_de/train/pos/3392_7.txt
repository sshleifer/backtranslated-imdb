This was a very thoughtful movie, especially for 1973. At that time, it was a big box-office success. It seemed forgotten after the 1970s, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. Actually, it was at least fifteen years before his time ... Nobody heard the "greenhouse effect" before 1985 The controversial issue of euthanasia was rarely addressed. <br /> <br /> The sets and special effects may look a bit dated, but the big money for sci-fi movies was a gamble at the time. If you look closely, you will find that everything usually makes sense. This is a news movie, not for zapped Star Wars fans who can not go through a minute of thought provoking unless it contains millions of explosions. <br /> <br /> This was also Heston's last good movie, the end of his famous dystopian sci-fi trilogy. After that, everything was overflown catastrophe epics and big budget that satisfied the garbage. This may not be the funniest two-hour movie ever made, and the end could be scary and depressing, but it's hard to find a movie producer with courage to deal with a topic like this.
