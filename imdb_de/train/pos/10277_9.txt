This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never so briefly told. This is really about the failure of the trust, the human situation. The film gives the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is there anyone today who has not played this every day in our own society? The film is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except that there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is involved in the con. Could something be more true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.
