This is a crazy scientist who creates half a half-half-male animal on an unknown island and then calls all his old business associates and academic buddies to see his creation (bad laugh), but he wants to be that Shark-man kills her! Many bad GCI, goofy action elements and sweaty babes in tight T-shirts follow. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this piece brings a sense of humor (I guarantee you. The people who made this had tongues that were firmly planted in the cheek, not to mention the ones sexy women, but let's mention these sexy women - several hot women in tight t-shirts sweating heavily, one in the beginning in underwear, another in the end, thank you, thank you, maker of bad movies! The plot is full of stupid Stuff, a guy drives in a jeep, hammers him straight into a tree, and then offers to fly everyone off the island by helicopter Yes, um, well, how would we think about it for a while, we'll sign up The Hai Man is hilarious - either a terrible CGI or a comedic guy in a rubber suit - the crazy scientist does a pretty good job, he's evil, that's his motivation, he does not apologize <br /> <br /> If you want a stupid FUN B movie, it should do the job.
