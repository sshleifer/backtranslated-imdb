This is certainly one of my ever-popular episodes of Trek. There's just so much going on in this one movie that it's crazy cool. First, the guys are beaming at an alien planet that is just exploding. You meet a freaky librarian guy (played very well). Then Kirk manages to return to the earth of the 16th century. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow, but almost freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years ago. Kirk manages to lock himself up and be accused of witchcraft while Spock enjoys an amok time with a sexy cavegirl who has been defeated by a bad guy in this frozen, terrible world and gives McCoy a royal assestment if the doc states that they have to find a way out. Anyway, they all escape and leave the poor kavegirl behind. It takes a ton of persuasion before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally taste the sadness in the end. To leave the Cavegirl alone in its frozen wasteland seems cruel and really touches. Spock had to have withdrawn from his mind to leave his greatest hope for love and humanity behind. However in a not so nice area! <br /> <br /> Still, with this episode, you get so much for your money ... A love story, the Salem witch trials, Spock as a human, the desperation to be left in total isolation ... abandoned and three completely different settings on the foreign planet. It's amazing that they managed to make all this into a fifty-minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss it ... I want to show it on DVD.
