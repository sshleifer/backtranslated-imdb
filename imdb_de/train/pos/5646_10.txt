When I was shopping the other day, I saw the box of Americian Gothic and thought, "I remember that!" I adjusted my alarm clock so he got up and saw that when he was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1:30 (I was 14). I remember it mainly because it was really scary and funny. Nobody could ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!). <br /> <br /> But what annoyed me was that they did the same with the box set as on TV. Episodes in funny order, I always thought, when Matt is going ??? - You made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not to blame on the authors, producers or directors (their TV folks in the background are the moneymakers.) They still do the same thing. Check out shows like Carnivale and Farscape that do not like originality in studios !!!!! <br /> <br /> Finally - if you have not seen it yet, and sci-fi fantasy, horror, call supernatural drama .. Fan = YOU MUST. In reviewing the box set, they even said the same in SFX.
