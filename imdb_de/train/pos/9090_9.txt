"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast moving, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining music comedy by Warners that is unfortunately overlooked. It should be remembered, if only for the official title song of Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood". However, the score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer contains a number of other gems, including the charming "I'm Like a Fish Out of the Water" and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight". The best musical number is "Let That Be a Lesson to You," in which Dick Powell and his company describe the mishaps of people who were "behind the eight-ball," a fate that in the truest sense of the word was the burning Edgar Kennedy strikes the end. The picture celebrates Hollywood's glamor and punctuates everything at once, because it brings a lot of comic miles of pompous and ego-manic actors and double studio managers. The cast includes a number of great comedians with character - Allyn Joslyn as a skilled press agent, Ted Healy as a potential manager of Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as an encouraging restaurateur, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as As Car Traffic Manager Mabel Todd as Monas Duffy Sister and Hugh Herbert as her daddy. The "racist" element mentioned in another post is a ten-second bit in which Herbert appears in Blackface during a pseudo "gone with the wind" sequence. It has a questionable taste, but it should not stop you from seeing the other delights in the movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!). I think it's the only footage available in this incredible jazz combination. The sequence "Dark Eyes" takes a little too long and comes too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel that is really worthwhile and certainly a movie that should be considered for a DVD release.
