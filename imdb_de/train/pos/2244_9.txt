The only explanation why this movie is not widely used is that it comes too close to home for some. This film was a real happy surprise, the satire is genius. This movie turns on the light in the dark, where religion and big media are organized, and the cockroaches look for cover. Borrow the DVD and watch the DVD if you have not already. This film succeeds where many have failed (dogma comes to mind) to put their noses under the tent, both through humor and through very skilful analogies that tell scenes and scenes. I can not comment at length without revealing some major spoilers. There are some surprises in this film that even the experienced movie fan will be surprised.
