OK, I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was an advertisement for a sunscreen product. With all the people walking around on the beach. Still, I decided to look at it and thought it was a new show that I could laugh about. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was addicted, why is he in the trees, why did the plane crash, etc.? <br /> <br /> It's not common to see a show that combines intelligence, humor, action and excitement. But "Lost" does it all. With a great cast and crew, beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects, "Lost" will meet anyone who comes in and is a must for those who are fed up with cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost is on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
