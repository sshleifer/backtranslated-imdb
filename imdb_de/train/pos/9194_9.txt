I first saw this show when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I searched for subtitles that help me with Japanese. My host mother warned me against staying away because she thought it was strange, but I found it lovely! Koyuki showed such contradictory character traits and Matsujun's mind made my day every time I turned on! I first saw him on "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked him a lot better here! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed that they did not change much during the show. Her relationship grew, but she did not really. Nevertheless, everyone had a fun time (even for Fukushima!).
