This is a movie poem, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive craftsmanship. It captures the atmosphere of time and place perfectly. (Italy's lake district in the twenties.) It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes - the burial ship in the fog - the large view of the chess table in the center of an artfully patterned tile floor - are beautiful pictures. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bittersweet. If film is an art, this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
