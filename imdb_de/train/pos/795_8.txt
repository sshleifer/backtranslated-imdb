Too bad that a few comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on the actual events, a highly publicized case of disappearance and murder, which took place from '96 to 2000 in the Wilmington area, DE / Philadelphia PA I was quite impressed with how close they were to what happened in the local news and the news was constantly reported by Philadelphia Inquirer. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actress (which I really like in Cold Case) that Fahey played did not look at all (Anne Marie was actually nicer). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really sums up the kind of personality that has revealed himself as Capanos and the behavior that Capano has shown during that time. The details of the case were correct ... no deviations from dramatic effect ... to carpet, gun, furniture and radiator. Finally, I would like to add that I have met Tom Carper many times on various occasions (a good man, even though he is a politician) and I am so glad that he has drawn the necessary strings in Germany to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great that he finally got behind bars.
