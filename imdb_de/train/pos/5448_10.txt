This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is great as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a weird genius. The rest of the cast is incredible and the movie is really funny. A definite satire of horror movies, with a crazy twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedic evening, then rent this classic. You will laugh the whole way!
