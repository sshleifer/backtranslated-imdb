The first two sequences of this film led to two conflicts: the conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity and the physical conflict between Todd and his biotechnological replacement. Both sequences are quite compelling in different ways. <br /> <br /> The people's script is buzzing a bit when the first of these arcs breaks up halfway through the movie, meaning that the second half is little more than a straightforward action. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, kudos to the creators for creating a genre-action-piece with heart and even a little soul and above all Kurt Russell, who conveys a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but worth seeing.
