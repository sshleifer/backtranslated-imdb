Clark Gable plays a cheater who plunges into the life of hard-nosed lady Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while she strips him off with her tough bile. Despite their cynicism and their disadvantages, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a spike, he runs out and leaves Harlow in the women's prison, where she discovers she is pregnant. The writing by Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is consistently superb with many well-drawn and surprising figures (including a Jewish socialist inmate inmate and a black inmate inmate and her preacher father who barely played a trace of stereotypes). Gable and Harlow show their courage as actors, adding distinctive nuances and idiosyncrasies to their characters that transcend the typical Gable and Harlow roles. And the direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. In a nice shot, Harlow was taken to prison and taken to a surprisingly snow-covered courtyard as the camera followed her. This is one of the best of the genre "Criminals in Love" and "Women's Prison" and has some of the best dialogues ever written.
