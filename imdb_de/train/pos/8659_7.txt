In a way, this movie reminded me of Jumping Jack Flash. Do you remember Whoopi Goldberg at the crusher? Whoopi has defeated tranquilizers? Whoopi as a blind lemon and Mick Jagger imitate? Great moments that were captured on film, but the movie is still pretty annoying, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man listens to his wife singing for the first time. Teenagers after living together talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from the bucket and has a nice waking moment in relation to his absent wife in another scene. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe. However, there is only a whisper of a conspiracy, and you can not wait to move. Only when Charlotte Caffey's The Graces by ex-Go-Gos gets a great pop song going, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! the deep American south.
