This is undoubtedly the best stand up show ever. I've seen a lot of stand-up shows, been on many stand-up shows and watched Bets Comic View, but I've never seen anyone outperform Murphy's on this show. The impressions are excellent, the skits are great and the timing is perfect. You can even say that the crowd really goes into it. When he did Raw a few years later, it was really good too, but this is No. 1 in my book. It also shows that Murphy was funny at a time, especially in the early eighties. My favorite parts of the show are when he has the family grill and "ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! The iceman comes !!!!" Another great part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
