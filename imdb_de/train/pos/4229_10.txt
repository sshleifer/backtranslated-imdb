Do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this amazing episode, which could well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as the intriguing but charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his murder on her daughter. Columbo is his usual crumpling, confusion, and far smarter than he seems, and this particular episode includes fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by the announced creators Levinson or Link, but it may be the most dense, thoroughly original and confused Columbo storyline ever. In almost every department extremely satisfying and crowded with loud and funny dialogues and reflections. A truly unexpected and imaginative climax surpasses all. 10/10 ... here on Netflix!
