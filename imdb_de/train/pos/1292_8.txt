Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially for financial reasons. He is crazy about his own house and his own rules, since his brothers have always stolen his salvaged money and his parents neglect his wishes. One terrible day Preston cycled; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to be scared off by the police and accidentally driven the car over Preston's bike. Quigley, far from the police, hurries to check the damage to Preston's bicycle. The problem was: It was a blank check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a high price for this check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston things he has always wanted, like a villa with pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, which puts Preston into a difficult situation and faces many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites in my childhood. :)
