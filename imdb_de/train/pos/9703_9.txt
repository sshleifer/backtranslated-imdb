One of the best comedy series ever from the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and performers who feel at home with drama and comedy. They are supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson and have populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. The small Britain is blind as an insignificant imitation of her ideas. Consistently original and groundbreaking I'm sure so many people hate this series as they love, but I'm just as certain that no one could have an opinion on LOG. I have not seen the full-length movie yet, but I've heard good and bad things, so I'll reserve the verdict. The original radio series from which LOG originated was as innovative as the television series. I do not know if the TV series made it to the US, but I would be intrigued to see the American audience finding the funny English of humor
