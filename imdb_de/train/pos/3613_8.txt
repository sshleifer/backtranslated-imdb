When "Girlfight" came out, the reviews praised it, but I did not get to see it. I finally saw it when it was released on video and I understand the glowing reviews. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get to know the student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a terrible look on her face, and any idea of ​​Diana that we could draw from that phrase will soon be confirmed when she gets into a fight. When Diana gets into trouble, we meet her father, an aggressive type for herself; Of course, we can not completely blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the movie really starts, as a new thought sprouts in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this bleak existence. Her older brother has already begun boxing, but her father will probably not allow it. Only Diana can decide for herself what she should do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes showed that I had a very crappy, non-Hollywood movie, but John Sayles' short appearance in a supporting role confirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes You feel as if you see the ugly life in which Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the main story of the movie, there's no turning back. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a means to show that someone is trying to make something of themselves has been a cliché in the cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I think so still that this was the case did a great job with that. In fact, this could have brought the genre to the apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself on this film in Hollywood movies.
