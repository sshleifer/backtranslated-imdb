It was around 7:30 in the morning, too close to the school to see often. The animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea that cowboys and ordinary people randomly spin spacecraft and robots was amazing. Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it is really boring in DVD format. The shows are all basically identical. If you are not viewing sequential episodes on a DVD, you are stoned by volume # 3. By today's standards, the animation is spotty. We no longer perceive computer graphics, focusing instead on how kitsch the characters are. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the heroic figures. They were much more credible, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and were not cheesy. They actually saved men.
