This movie is really funny! If you want to rest for an hour, have a look. It is called blond and blond. So do not expect profound and meaningful jokes. What this movie and all stereotypes enjoy, we have over two blondes. It's just a funny movie, on a date or with a group of friends (especially if you're not too sober, Lol). Pamela and Denise are still pretty hot girls. It is a mistake to regard this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It should be easy, funny and superficial. One more thing, I do not think girls will appreciate and like this movie, but the guy will definitely do it.
