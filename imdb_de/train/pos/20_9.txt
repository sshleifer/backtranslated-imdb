'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to be educated and to realize its potential. For Iris it is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda start and stop together before everyone has the skills and the courage to fully trust and move on. In this sense, it gives us a good overview of how life is often, and is therefore credible. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the rendered characters were consistent throughout the image. The minor cast is also chosen carefully and gives the main characters a depth that adds additional meaning to the supporting performances. All in all, an excellent movie. The best I can get is hope.
