What a wonderful movie that can be used for so many labels: science fiction, film noir, with a script and a high-intelligence dialogue that requires an educated, cultured audience ... the kind of English-language films that only England was made before 1960 (and shown only in the US when it arrived), and never in the US. Main characters in The Man in White Suit (1951) with Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysilicon scientific reference terms such as "polymer," discuss and explain concepts of chemistry such as "long-chain molecules," and then share the importance of these values ​​with the average person. > The Man in a White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game exploding films that are now (2009) dominating world cinema and certainly dominating American cinema, an intelligently told tale of talented and credibly educated English actors ( the pla (educated, savvy people), all with comedy, charm, pathos and irony that would have endorsed the ancient Greek playwrights. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie, and someday somehow - some worthy filmmakers and its supporters should do something similar. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
