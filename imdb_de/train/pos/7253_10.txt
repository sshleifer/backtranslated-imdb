Not sure that this can be described as an anti-war movie, it shows war at the elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are very proud of it. Even if they are a pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and the defeat of their enemies, even if it is against a pacifist. The films are slow and fairly uneventful and tend to be tame in many ways, as war movies by today's standards tend to be such that no body parts fly away like in modern movies. It's brutal in other ways, though you see killing on a personal level. This is more of a thinking movie. Once you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts of the men in the film and their interactions are what the movie is all about - not the fight itself or a big exciting plot. This can be called a war trill. <br /> <br /> If you are into martial arts, if you want to read or watch programs on the SAS, etc., WANT TO WAKE UP THIS FILM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Similar films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49. Parallel (1941) with All Star Cast, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual in their own way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
