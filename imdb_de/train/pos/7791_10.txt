Another movie that you hear from friends (or read on IMDb). Not many false notes in this one. I was able to do almost anything here with a young girl who fled from an abandoned hometown in Tennessee to Florida with all his worldly possessions in an old, battered car. The heroine Ruby makes some false starts, but learns from them. I was wondering why, why she had not leaned a bit more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a good movie. The only thing I do not like very much is the title.
