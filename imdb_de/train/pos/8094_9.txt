First of all, no adjustment is as good as the book, especially if it's a master like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION miraculously synthesizes Tolkien's universe with psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture of the 1970s. Yes - the animation and background painting in their technical execution is sometimes a bit "rough", but nevertheless beautiful and very evocative, which gives each scene a unique "sense of place". Beyond the absolute uniqueness in images is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting, which is far superior to the new live action films. And although the cell animation is not the "most technically competent" animation, it captures the expressive body and facial gestures of the drama excellently while not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motifs to absolute abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes significantly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who needs a lot of computer rendering in a movie to see everything visualized for you, I find you may not like this movie. However, if you like superior acting, transcendental imagery and JRR Tolkien, then this movie is a must.
