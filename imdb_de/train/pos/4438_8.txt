Director Edward Montagne does in a little more than an hour what other, more expensive and hyped films do not do. Mr. Montagne shows us a police description by Phillip H. Reisman Jr., which, while not one of the best in the genre, incorporates the viewer into the action as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a Type B movie. Indeed, the best thing about "The Tattooed Stranger" is the opportunity to take a look at New York. The crystal-clear cinematography of William O. Steiner has either been preserved in this way over the years or lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> There are great views of New York in the opening sequence. Later we will be transferred to Dumbo Department in Brooklyn and later the film will go to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road area with its numerous monuments in the area detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant expert of the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who has dealt with bigger things in his career, is seen in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was great fun to see a city as it was because it no longer exists.
