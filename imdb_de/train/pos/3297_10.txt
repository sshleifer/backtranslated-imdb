The ultimate tribute to a great movie actress. The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the canvas. Like great poetry, it is timeless. Direction, cast, script, music, lyrics and all the norms for filming are perfectly chosen. Muslim society in India has never before been presented with so much respect, nobility and reality. The script is in the hands of Meena, Ashok, Raaj Kumar, Nadira, etc., just to name a few. Personally, I was most impressed by the majestic looking Kamal Kapoor. The master of filmmaker Kamal Amrohi is a lasting legacy of the subcontinent. A very nice film about a controversial topic that makes humanity seek out the reality of the outcasts of the world? Pakeeza! Haan Pakeza '. This acting is unknown in the age of sex, dance and pornography.
