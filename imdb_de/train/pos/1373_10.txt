This movie should be viewed for all librarians or budding librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. The argument of the public library vs. The academic library is a classic argument run by librarians and students of the library school. It also breaks many librarian stereotypes. Librarians can even have fun - even if they * normally * do not have sex in the Romance language section! (The Best Librarian Librarian? S Desk Set, of course with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.)
