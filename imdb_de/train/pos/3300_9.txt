Pakeezah has a very interesting story (well documented in the "Trivia" section) about how it came about. It seems that fate has teamed up to test Kamal Amrohi (the director), while at the same time secretly wishing to have him complete his masterpiece. As a result, the intensity with which emotions arise reaches a dimension that is not very real but is very effective and has an impact on the viewer. Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan her own. The other stars of the film are next to her Ghulam Mohammed (the music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background music) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Your music and cinematography will leave you spellbound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It shows you new levels each time you look at it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of the cinema and has given us all a gift.
