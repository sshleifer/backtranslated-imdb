From the windshield shot into the car, someone plays his newest song from someone else, someone else has not responded, according to voice-over. I'm just wondering how that was done. There were too many scenes in this film that surprised me how a camera was there. If the scenes in which the Warhols were filmed at a BJM after party are true, then that was an inexcusable exploit to the max. If not, was it a total fabrication, or was it uncomfortable for me if that was the purpose? All the way through this movie, I kept asking myself how the material was made. At face value, a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius that we all believe can be.
