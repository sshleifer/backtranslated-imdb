The imperturbable William Powell. It's a pleasure to see on screen how he walks through situations that are not worried in the world. He always seems to be above his game and does not care much about anyone who doubts him. The murders are projects, hardly any people. I've noticed that this is a staple of whodunnit. Apart from an occasionally crying widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason for the film. Nothing more. There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way, and Powell is a master at it. There are many political mistakes, especially with regard to Asian artists. That's a bit hard to take. The cast is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
