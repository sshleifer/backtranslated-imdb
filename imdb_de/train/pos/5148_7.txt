I do not know what it is with these films. However, films about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course it is not 100% accurate. It's hard to make 100% accurate films today, even if the "experts" are not in agreement. That's why I prefer to rate a movie based on what it wants to say rather than pick out all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> I start by liking this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years have passed too quickly. The series should have been a three-part story, his childhood was the first part. But if they did not have more money to do more story, who would I criticize? <br /> <br /> There is only one problem I have with this film and that is the fact that it is told in a story book by book. Especially the second part is just a sum of events that have happened. I would rather have seen Hitler humane (more scenes in which he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did that more in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better, I think. Nevertheless, I am glad that it was made and is on DVD. Just to more vividly remember what happened and to see how Carlyle does his best. 7.5 / 10
