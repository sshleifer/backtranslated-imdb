This movie was very good. If you see horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good, although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotions behind her lines. Allan was very good and I found the cinematography incredible. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends were freaking and screaming. It was in my opinion a complete success and should have brought it to the big screen. I give two thumbs up! I would definitely say, if you have not seen it yet, then rent it. If you saw it and did not like it, look again, because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how much film was made in the school and on campus at my school.
