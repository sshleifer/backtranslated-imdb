This is not a masterpiece theater. You should not go into it. This is pure Girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads. As someone else has said, this is the movie Baby Mama should be. The only downside I see for this movie is that Tina Fey was not there - except that he shows the smartest and smartest girls in the world. The film is pure stupidity on the surface, but if you are really watching, you will know that it has many messages and a deep meaning for each one of us who wishes he could go back and do it again in life, and then know what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for an escape after 84 minutes.
