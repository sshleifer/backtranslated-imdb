Michael Cacoyannis has a relatively long career behind him, but has surprisingly little credit for his name, including some real duds like the ill-tempered Cold War satire The Day the Fish Came Out. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the game of Euripides, it is an outstanding reproduction of the classic tragedy. Recently, the first television appearance has been shown for many years in the US in the Flix channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but is definitely not a "big" movie, with a focus on the simple story: In the appeal to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). much to the dismay of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding, but it is the breathtaking Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the canvas, combining the innocence of childhood with the beginning of recognition that she is the plaything in a political game. Highly recommended for fans of international cinema.
