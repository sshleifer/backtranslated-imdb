I saw a special preliminary check today. I have to let you know, I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters spending a weekend with his family. In a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she is his brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well done - the soundtrack, cinematography and acting are all first class, especially Steve Carell. My problem was mainly that there was a lack of character development, mainly Dane Cook's character. We never really got a closer look at the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt that this might have contributed a bit to how Dan's inner conflict about being in love with Dane's friend was. Besides, Dan is definitely a solid, sweet movie in Real Life - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we got this year.
