Best show since Seinfeld. She is really funny. Their total selfishness, the huge gay neighbors, the turning away in songs or cartoons make this the freshest show on TV. One of the few shows I concentrate on. The scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ("oh wait now that you are near, you look old", turns away with his finger and goes away lol), the cough syrup overdose sleeping with God, or ? It's just so silly fun. The weak points of the show are her sister and the policewoman just because they are too damn normal !! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt for a show for a long time.
