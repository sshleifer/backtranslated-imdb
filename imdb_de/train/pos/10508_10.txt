Mario is invited to cake at Princess Peach's Castle. When Mario arrives there, he learns that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario has to save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore everything he wants. He can just walk around, climb trees, search for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. No time limits There are 16 worlds with multiple stages and star doors that require a certain number of stars. When you enter these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a series of stars to enter. You enter the world by going through a painting. There is so much to do and so many hours of gameplay that I do not see how anyone can dislike this game. It is great. This startup title is the game that assures insured players that the N64 would have a good life. Every known 3D platform game has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the best games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find because nobody sells this baby for $ 5 at the pawn shop. A perfect 10th
