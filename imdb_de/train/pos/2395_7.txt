Although it was unfortunate to meet the Austin festival here (SXSW movie) just as we got tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at "The Scottish Play," as the actors call "Macbeth" to avoid the curse, is a crisp, efficient, and stylish treatment of the betrayal that hits the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative rating and a far better look than its small budget suggests, this is a quiet gem, not world class, but absolutely satisfying.
