Of course, if you read my review, you have already seen this movie. "Raja Babu" is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on his bike. Watch movies and emulate characters, etc. I love the scene when a rock breaks in the mouth of Kader Khans eating. Even where Shakti Kapoor tells a crazy story about Raja Babu's affairs on a dining table, and Govinda in "Dharam-Veer" uniform wears sentimental remarks. This is my favorite scene of the movie. "Achcha Pitaji's To Main Chalta Hoon" scene is just a chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue. It is brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just see how these actors help each other and still take the scene away. It is the total entertainment. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan, then this is a must. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", Coolie # 1 "precedes this gem of the movie 7/10.
