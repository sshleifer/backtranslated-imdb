If you grew up with a diet of game shows, you will understand that you will need a bigger and better solution bit by bit. Well, in the world of Running Man, your needs are met. Because in this game show prisoners fight for freedom and the ultimate prize - their whole life. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of the insane tripple we observe daily. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it's a very good movie. The underlying idea that TV companies will someday be the "real" rulers of the planet is very credible and is portrayed very well in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite is, if he should be catapulted into the game area, asks the Gameshow presenter: "Last words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'm back," but the host says "Just in a repeat" and presses the eject button. I give this movie a 10 for sheer originality. I must have seen it 30 or more times. The only movie except the Die Hard series that I've seen a lot !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think for a minute that you own the TV.
