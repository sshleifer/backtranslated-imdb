A great exciting movie with great, slow camera work that adds to the drama makes this a pleasure to watch and enjoy. Director Brian de Palma makes a Super Hitchcock imitation with this film (many call it "rip off") and the 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera work (and several scenes, each with hidden people) Page lost on formatted TV cassettes. <br /> <br /> The downside of the movie, at least for anyone with a kind of moral standard, is the general sloppiness of all the characters, including the cop, played by Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking as Angie Dickinson has a rather long shower scene that is quite explicit even 25 years after her appearance. The film has several erotic scenes like Dickinson (when she's really close-ups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing off their bodies. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are fascinating and although it's obvious who the killer is, it's still very exciting and fun to look all the way, especially for men who abuse naked women.
