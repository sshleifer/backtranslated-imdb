While prices have risen sharply and some details are outdated, any homeowner struggling with home problems should make a lot of giggles in this film. I know that I did that. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, a New York advertising expert, decides to relocate his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a beautiful house there. He gets into a funny jam after the other, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction issues, as the cost and timing of the design are always out of control. I thought in the funniest scenes, Blandings hired a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet but never find water. Only a short distance away, a few days later, the cellar of his future house flooded! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are performing credibly, while the harried Blandings couple are overwhelmed with problems they could never have imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better than Blanding's lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that society's attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a kind of naive fool who did this. No idea how much extra trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horror!). Do not watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you will enjoy it all the more. <br /> <br />
