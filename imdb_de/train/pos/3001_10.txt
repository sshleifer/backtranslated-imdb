Cracking good yarn with all the actors who have great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Many nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and best. A forerunner of the Thin Man series. Recommend to anyone. Did you find out everything?
