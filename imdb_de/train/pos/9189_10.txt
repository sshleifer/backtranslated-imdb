Let me first say that I saw this episode for the first time at 10 o'clock on DVD on DVD. One night I could only fall asleep at 3:00. <br /> <br /> This short review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I. I can say for sure that this is the best episode I've ever seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that way, but I do. This episode is the same as the weekend I was with my family to monitor my own father, who was ICU in ICU before he died. The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he's a salesman who's identity was confused with that of a man named Kevin Finnerty. When ten minutes had passed, I knew that either Tony was dreaming or I saw another show. It was not like the normal sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks up into the sky at a "helicopter headlight" and we see a doctor with a flashlight. We only see it for a moment and the sequence runs until we return to a situation similar to the one I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tony has just come out of a coma for a moment. His boys take A.J. home and Carmella, overwhelmed by stress, collapses in the hallway: a characteristic moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we cut the real world: the family that bypasses the potential Negative result of this coma and Tony's alternative reality, the parallels to the processes in his head and in the real world World around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the outstanding point in the episode: After AJ He tells his mother that he has dropped out of school and goes to Meadow, who is sitting next to Anthony. She approaches Tony and says the best line of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on the light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to vote, but he can not - as if to say something to Carmella, but could not move. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out of his window. A shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode seems to call him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold, I'd like to die" by Moby marries perfectly with these last pictures and helps create an emotional roller coaster ride of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. You find out what the light is. It is wonderful.
