I do not know if I'm just funny, but I really enjoyed this movie. Return to Cabin by the Lake is of course the sequel to one of my favorite movies from Cabin by the Lake. I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that the cast in this movie was great. Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the story as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming Stanley's Cabin by the Lake script. It was not a completely unnecessary movie in which Stanley grabbed other girls and drowned them. - If you're looking for deeper meaning, this movie is probably not right for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then take a look. I've probably killed at least ten hours when I saw this movie. :)
