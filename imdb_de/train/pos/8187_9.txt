Does anyone care that the Ood is strangely similar to the 'Great Cthulhu' of the H P Lovecraft vintage? Hmmm? <br /> <br /> Great Couple of Episodes (does not refer to Billie Piper, as it seems to most!) in The Impossible Planet and the Satan's Pit. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I Also think in who before and also regarding Satan in different novels after Exorcist era ... <br /> <br /> Great Suspense episodes with Fear and belief elements. The new team for this "who works great for television". <br /> <br /> This is certainly creating new fears and "hiding behind the couch" - feelings that have not been seen in this sequel to an outstanding BBC series for many, many years (pity, it's the BBC confirms that Billie Piper will give up after the end of the series 2 - maybe not permanently): O (((
