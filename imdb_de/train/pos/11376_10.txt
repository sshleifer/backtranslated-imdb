This is one of the best serial killer movies I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs. HBO has cracked the jackpot here. This film is convincing from the first moment to the last moment. <br /> <br /> This film has so many basic themes that it's hard to say exactly what it's about. It documents the decades-long search for the Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives an extremely restrained performance as an inexperienced forensic expert commissioned with the investigation, and Donald Sutherland is even more effective than his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him. Both performances are subtle masterpieces - Rea begins to be naive and uncompromising, while Sutherland is detached and almost amused by the situation. Toward the end, Rea gets more world weary and beaten by the system, while Sutherland becomes more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other movie, I would have said that Sutherland's performance surpasses the rest. But Jeffrey DuMann even makes it here as a serial killer himself. Here, in a brilliant way, DuMann creates a character that arouses more empathy than the hatred we believe he would find - he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the idea that he is with the What he does is just as disgusted as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but also vicious. <br /> <br /> If you can record the incredibly dark theme (and it's * very * disturbing) you should watch this movie.
