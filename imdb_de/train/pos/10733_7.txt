The re-watching of this movie really brought back great childhood memories. I'm 34 now and have not seen it since I was 12-14. I almost forgot this movie, but when I saw it again recently, some scenes literally brought a tear in my eyes! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like a retrospective of my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always appreciate this movie for that reason. I hope some readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular film, but for any movie you have not seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thanks for reading
