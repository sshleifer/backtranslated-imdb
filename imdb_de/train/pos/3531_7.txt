Robert Siodmak does an excellent job with this B-Noir with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I would add, without much help from his male actors, d. H. Curtis and Tone. It's all Raines, a pretty, long-legged actress who for some reason has never achieved the status of some of her "noir" partners. Siodmak truly uses sex, light, shadow and music as he tackles this genre. The shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. The highlight of the film, however, takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum reel by Elisha Cook, inspired by an excited Raines. This scene takes "Phantom Lady" into new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is only surpassed by Raines, who shows a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her husband. Franchot Tone called this one. Alan Curtis did not seem to be angry that he might die, and did not seem happy that he was alive. And he seemed to be in love with Raines, except for a brief moment in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that their interest in psychiatry increased during the Second World War. But often the terms were misused in movies like "Possessed," "Spellbound," and "The Greatest Show on Earth." Tone is described by Thomas Gomez as paranoid - Tone probably has some paranoia with his illness, but he seems closer to a psychopath. In fact, as his headaches prove, he may have pressed a brain tumor against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady does not have the best story, but it's worth looking at.
