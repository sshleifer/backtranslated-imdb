This was an incredibly funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly staffed as parents, and the kids were great too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was a rather weakened version of Married with Children's Kelly Bundy. The writing and the performances were both first class. <br /> <br /> John Ritter unfortunately died during the show, which dampened things. They had to make an effort to change the show and bring more performers, and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they handled it well. James Garner was a good match. It could have taken longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I loved it when they brought Ed O'Neill to a hostel. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
