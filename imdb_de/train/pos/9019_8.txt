Since I do not want to give away anything *, I would just say that this technically excellent, flawlessly uplifting and uplifting little movie will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half of entertainment: it will be amused, surprised, sometimes embarrassing and almost certainly tearing from Time after time at heart as it approaches the inevitable, but is not obvious and ends without becoming clich√©d or foreseeable in any way. Definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> An earlier comment from the user indicates 8 out of 10 points for the film and 10 out of 10 points for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding achievements.
