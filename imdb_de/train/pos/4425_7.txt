Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the Chambara genre. Successful and not to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> Buddhist monk has the vision to kill a legendary (and very active) demon at the Gojoe Bridge to gain enlightenment. Though Buddhist thought is not in the foreground, it is at the center of this film, much like Kurosawa's "Ran". It probably made the movie most interesting for me, even though it is now near "Ran" league. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual focus and excellent photography keep the movie interesting for the entire duration of two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are consistently outstanding. The music is really good. The two weaknesses are the story and the fighting scenes. The film moves into the middle, which could be remedied by careful editing. And the fight scenes are usually shot in blurry close-ups. This works for most of the movie, but the finale looks like a scam. Another current movie like this one is Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords," a great movie, but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. Asano really does not move like a sword with a demon, his acting is great, but he would be an extra in a traditional Chambara fighting scene. <br /> <br /> A good movie, you probably find it interesting. I do not expect traditional swordfights.
