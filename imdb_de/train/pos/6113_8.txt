After watching "Marrying Mafia," I almost lost my confidence in the Korean movie business. But this brought back my faith. <br /> <br /> Leading female character who is a student forced to teach the spoiled, rich, yet charismatic high school student. He is actually the age of a woman. Through some hilarious quarrels these two became good friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellence. He was such a revelation !! Actress Kim Haulul was also charming as always. <br /> <br /> This film tries to avoid clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it showed us no unnecessary naked sex scenes. It was brilliant, lovely, fresh, I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br />
