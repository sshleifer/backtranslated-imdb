What is very French in this film is the time to establish the two main characters. This may require some patience, especially since both are "attractive" in the typical definition of Hollywood. However, as soon as the "theft" begins, the film rushes fast, sometimes too fast. But it's a real roller coaster ride, and if you do not look too closely, it's all pretty believable. The kind of movie you know Hollywood would have fooled.
