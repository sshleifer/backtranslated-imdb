This wonderful BBC television production from 1983 (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre" starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane is the best version ever made. since she is most faithful to Charlotte Bronte's novel in both concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for special reasons; When film producers begin to mix with the lifeblood of a classic, this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of THIS "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, resulting in a spectacularly addictive brew that should be viewed several times to enjoy their layered sweetness, joy and suspense. The performances are delightful, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and exterior shots are beautiful and set the tone for the staging. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, albeit minor, is that this version, like any other version ever made by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that made Jane's character and her moral choices affected. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but stay with Rochester after finding out that he had a crazy wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just let you divorce," she said to her husband or she would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she could not settle for this course and not respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had taught since childhood, not the brutal Calvinist lowood institution, but the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred rather than turn the other cheek. One day, I would like to see a version that details these influences in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine's writing: "Come, Lord Jesus!" should not have removed the foundations of this belief from it.
