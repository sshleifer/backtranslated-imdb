Greetings from the darkness. Insight into the spirit and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us is to see someone who has to work ... no matter what the conditions, otherwise his livelihood ends. Seeing Goldsworthy's sculptures alive and seeing them respond to each of them is highly voyeuristic. This artist creates because he has to - not for money or fame. It is his life force. When you see his mistakes, the energy in his body seems to flow like a burst hot air balloon. It is not the fear of starting over, but he takes his energy from his work. Watching him take on nature and remember his work is a bit painful but breathtaking. He discusses flux and time in minimal dialogue, and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one. When he says that he needs the earth, but she does not need him ... I ask you to be different. The only complaint is that the score seems to slow down a pace that is relaxing at best.
