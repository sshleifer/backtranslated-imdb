24 is the best TV show !!!!! It's an incredible TV series with incredible excitement, excellent plots and memorable characters. And the first episode of all is my best proof. Because it is only the first episode, only the introduction, and you are fascinated because of the conspiracy and the uninterrupted turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent who receives the protection of Senator David Palmer. He can not trust anyone because CTU may be involved. And when this incident occurred, his daughter escapes: Kimberly flees from the house to a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode you want to see more and more and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first of all, and it's excellent.
