Who would have thought that they could be so funny? Christopher Meloni and Janel Moloney are better known for their outstanding work in some of television's hottest dramas. ("Law & Order: SVU" and "The West Wing") When you put them together on the big screen, you get a romantic comedy with a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> The performers develop the story further relationship with impressive abilities that force the audience to fall in love with Barry Singer (Meloni), although he is a stand-up comic that also happens to be a meaner, more sexist Idiot is. <br /> <br /> I will root him, even though he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and hunts Thea (Moloney) halfway across the country, hoping to win her heart. They have so little in common ... but when Barry finally opens his heart, you'll wonder why Thea keeps running away. <br /> <br /> The Souler Opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a talented writer. Worth your time. <br /> <br />
