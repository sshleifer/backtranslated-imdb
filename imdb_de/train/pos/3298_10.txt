This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has it all - a really touching script, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art, a really elegant romance (it's a shame that this kind of romance is straight does not seem to exist anymore), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in it. The end was just a disappointment as I expected a spectacular movie to have a brilliant ending - but it was still more wonderful than the vast majority of the films out there. Look at this movie in any case - over and over again. There are many details that you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
