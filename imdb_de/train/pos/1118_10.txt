Well, this could be one of the funniest movies ever, and Sandy is giving a tour de force performance! Unfortunately, her career has never quite begun, but eventually she will always be remembered with her three first-class images: "The King of Comedy," "Dallas Doll," and "Without You I Am Nothing." She dedicated herself to various celebrities from New York's celebrity and Diana Ross to create a snappy and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and wild, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene and is really "really pretty". Take a look at this (if you are not from Iowa), you will definitely enjoy it!
