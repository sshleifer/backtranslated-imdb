Question: How do you steal a scene from the expert of the scene artist Walther Mathau in full, angry and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? Answer: quiet, staggering and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about vaudeville, but this remains a favorite movie. The two leads are hilarious, the script funny, the direction and the tempo very good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a pure man - he tries to get through the window to Burns etc. Even the small parts are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes in which Mathau messes up the commercial, and Burns repeats responses as if senile ... <br /> <br /> A pleasure. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
