The young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he can not sexually satisfy her and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and wants a divorce. One day she dives into a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after! She meets the young and very beautiful Adam (Aribert Mog). They love each other and she realizes that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ENDING !!!! Since this was done in 1933, she must of course be punished for her sin, which leads to a tragic finale. END OF THE END OF THE SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This horrified people in 1933 is pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarr's nude swimming shows nothing and when she runs after the horse completely naked, it is either shown at extreme distance or is covered by branches and the like. There are only a few shots of her breasts. Even if she has sex with Mog, only her face is shown, but you see an orgasm. This scene was considered quite extreme in its day and was completely excluded from the American release. Today they are back. This movie would now get along easily with a PG-13. <br /> <br /> Shock episodes aside, that's just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there is virtually no dialogue. Apart from the music score, this could be a quiet picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog, and they are so attractive that they'll take your breath away when you watch them. The sequence in which they love is easily one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Unfortunately, the scenes of sexual symbolism (there are some of them) are quite obvious today. I actually started giggling! <br /> <br /> So good direction, nice pictures, attractive actors, good acting - but I was not thrilled. I found the movie slow (beautiful pictures do not make a picture for me), a bit boring, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the end, but it does not excuse the other problems I had with it. The last sequence is REALLY strange - and out of place. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and would recommend, but with care. Many people seem to love this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.
