The Series 2 has a good start! I do not think you need to watch Series 1 to get an overview of what's going on, but like every series, it's nice to have a feel for the characters and to see what happens to them. And this show makes you think so! These 4 30-year-old women seem to live a glamorous and exciting life, but the premise is believable and realistic. The twists and turns that come in thanks to their love and sex life are exciting to look at, but you also know that these are problems that also happen to real women. It's about the choices we make as women and how we are sometimes guided in certain ways in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
