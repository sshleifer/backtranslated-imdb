Every kid has this movie he puts in the VHS when he has nothing to do or when there's a babysitter around. This was the movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot, I must have seen it at least 100 times and I can say that it is a good children / family movie. <BR /> <br /> I still have the tape, I have not seen it for 5 years, but maybe I will join this week and become a kid for the day. <br /> <br /> You just love the nursing bears and their message. <br /> <br />
