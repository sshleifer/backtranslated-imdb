This is an amazing movie from 1936. Although the first hour (for the modern-day viewer) is not particularly interesting, the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes after that makes up for it. However, do not plan to understand the entire dialogue - the sound quality and accents (it's Americans - but "1930s Americans") make it difficult. Basically, the story is a sweeping story of a 100-year-old view of a fictional US city called "Everytown." It extends from 1936, when war is on the horizon, to 2036, when technology leaps ahead and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow - although it's hard to spot the audience back then I would have thought. The events, tension and visualization are quite restrained from today's perspective. But when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. The big sets and the retro sci-fi look of everything are hard to beat. <br /> <br /> If you do not have good listening skills, this movie is hard to hear. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. It could use subtitles. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, this is one of the classics of the genre and is a must (at least after the first hour). Wait for the average viewer until there is a subtitle version, and look at it if you are familiar with movies of that time.
