I was really amazed at how much a movie over 60 years old impressed me. It's almost two hours long, there are absolutely no stars, there are subtitles, but still it's interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of the ice, because you can see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world as it is today. I wondered how much work that had been for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Who wants to talk about Titanic now? It's a great movie with a great message, and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic films can be when filmed only with realism rather than visual effects.
