This 370-minute film was broadcast in the early seventies by Italian public television. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer from Odysseus' journey to the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean cultures that occurred 500 years after these events around 1100 BC. Was told. <br /> <br /> This is a movie from 1969, so if you buy the DVD version I would find that the sound is only mono and there is no language other than Italian, even the caption is on Italian. Pity. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if the English subtitles were included. But if this is not a problem for you, I would strongly recommend watching this movie.
