That will be a bit short. First, do not listen to the critics, because it's not as bad as most say !! Sniper uses a classic film formula that many consider wrong. Although the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about the operation of our country's military snipers, he gives those who know nothing about the professional sniper an insight into the world of the sniper. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but which movie is not? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I have to say the two worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane in the Marines bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing power sweeping it !! In addition, there are many good shots of the jungle and some classic shots with the camera, as if you were looking through a riflescope. And yes, the Sniper motto is "One Shot, One Kill". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
