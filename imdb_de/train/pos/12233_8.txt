The astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades make a space mission, flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed instantly, but it seems that they are indeed the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth, a steady stream of humanoid pulp. When he transforms into a wild killer, who melts every step of the way, he is led by his friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) follows. <br /> <br /> This is often so excitingly funny - with enough absurd lines and situations where you can move - that I find it difficult to believe that laughter is all unintentional. It seems like a joke to me about the low budget genre efforts of the 50s and 60s, so it's a wonderfully entertaining movie. This sequence with the nurse is just funny. We even have a split-screen sequence that does not really add anything but is still visible. <br /> <br /> The author / director William Sachs deserves recognition for this ingenious idea. His ultra-slimy character is indeed a memorable one. I think his pace is a little bit outlandish; Some scenes (like those with the older couple) take a little longer, but in the end, they deliver solid, fluffy B-movie products with a certain amount of panache. The highlight is especially funny. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is pleasantly shuddering (but funny at times), and Willy Curtis' cinematography sometimes produces really great shots. That brings me to the fantastic and compelling make-up effects of Rick Bakers, which form a very respectable focal point for the movie, to the ultimate final melt. Rebar is almost under the make-up for the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for the movie on the ground) and does what he needs to do well enough. DeBenning makes for a rather stupid and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as keen as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are good at supporting. It's also worth seeing folk like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (a notable topless shot), Janus Blythe (from Tobe Hooper's "Eaten Alive" and Wes Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes") and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit Part. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely entertaining midnight movie with enough pay, chills and laughter to reward it for low-grade sci-fi / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> 8/10
