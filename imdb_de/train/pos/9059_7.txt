This is a good movie, a good family movie that you can watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a bit disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is about a new kid in town called Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day, or the bully wins. <br /> <br /> The acting is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. The little actors exaggerate in many things. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg, however, has done a great job. <br /> <br /> The plot is good for a movie, but it's bad for a book adaptation. I could see this movie without looking at the time ... sometimes. Overall, this was a good family movie with some weaknesses. I rate this movie as 7/10.
