A 14-year-old girl first develops into the 17-year-old boy who lives nearby and at the same time tries to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film of Age of Age by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for directing the summer of '42 in 1971 and "To Kill A Mockingbird" in 1962, two giants of the coming genre. Here he directs newcomers to the lead roles: Reese Witherspoon in her film debut as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield as an older sister; Jason London as a court, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is remarkably good in her film debut and shows every emotion that a 14-year-old girl feels when she encounters young love and hurt, never hits the wrong mark. Warfield and London are equally good. The film accurately depicts the thoughts or feelings of each adolescent in terms of love with warmth of sensitivity and never even once turns into mudlines excess. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay by Jenny Wingfield; This is one of the few films about young love that is honest and consistent without being emotionally dishonest or sensational. The music is wonderfully simple, emphasizing tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becomes intrusive. The beautiful camera is from the famous horror movie Freddie Francis, who was in the 70s when it was filmed. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the parents of the girls in 1957 with great accuracy, caring, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. In this good-natured movie that tackles an emotional hurdle, there are feelings to sort, lessons to learn and truths to ask. To this day, this is the last movie by Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best movies of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
