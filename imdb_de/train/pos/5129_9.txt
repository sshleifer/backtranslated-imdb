I can see why this movie was Oscar-nominated for the Best Live Action Short because it was masterfully engineered. Even if you do not like the blues (although that sounded more like jazz to me), you can appreciate this movie. It's just very well done, though I can not see for my life why director Gjon Mili could only make a movie - this one. In other words, the film is nominated and the director did not get a career boost. As for the black performers, I could understand that this did not cause their careers to go high, as unfortunately the majority of white society has indifference (or worse) to blacks or "that kind of music" when they do Watch this movie, if you do not like the earlier part, you should go to the 5:50 mark, where it rises considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved significantly.
