I wish my own happy birds could talk. Tisk tisk about the reviewer who refused the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages can enjoy. Paulie is a lovely little sweetheart. He has some smart lines that really made me laugh. I especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz time. You can forgive the obvious stereotypes as you cheer him on in his search for a reunion with Marie. A charming movie with two strong characters who really make friends with the little parrot who has parted ways with his young owner. I would like to have seen more of the woman who is blind and has to give up her journey together. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, most recently with Marie, perhaps with the nice young man who helped him defeat the opponents to finish his journey.
