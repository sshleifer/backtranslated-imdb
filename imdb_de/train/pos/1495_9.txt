This is a great Amicus horror anthology with 3 great stories and fantastic performances! Only the last story disappoints. All the characters are great and the movie is pretty chilled and exciting, besides, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing! It's very undervalued and my favorite story has to be the 3rd "Sweets To The Sweet", and all the characters are very personable. Some of it is predictable, and the last story was unbelievably disappointing and rather bland! But the end was really cool! This is a great Amicus horror anthology with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story is disappointing!, I say it has to be seen! <br /> <br /> 1. History ("Method for Murder"). This is a great story with a lot of suspense and the killer Dominic is really scary and it is also played very well! This was the perfect way to start a story, and for the most part, it's unpredictable, and the twofold ending is shocking and pretty scary! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2. History. ( "Waxworks"). This is a solid story with wonderful performances, but the end is pretty predictable, but it is still scary and has some excitement, Peter Cushing did a great job and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was. I have this story really enjoyed! Grade B <br /> <br /> 3. Story ("Sweets to the Sweet"). This is the best story because it is extremely scary and unpredictable. She also has a nice twist! Christopher Lee did a great job and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as a young daughter, and the end is pretty shocking! I do not want to spoil you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th Story ("The Cape"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and listless. Jon Pertwee annoyed me, but the end surprised me a little, and Ingrid Pitt was great as ever, but she's just boring and has been done many times, and where was the creativity ??. Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with great camerawork, great angles, a bit scary atmosphere and a very fast pace of the movie !! <br /> <br /> The Acting is fantastic! John Bryans is great here, as a narrator, he had some great lines, I just wish he had more screen time. John Bennett is very good as a Det. And was pretty intense, in the end he was especially good! I really liked him. Denholm Elliott is excellent because Charles was vulnerable, showed fear, was very personable and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is amazingly great! And has done great with what she had to do as a woman. She also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly scary as Dominic, he looked scary and did the job extremely well! As usual, Peter Cushing is amazing and here he is amazing, he is sympathetic, focused, charming and as usual he had a lot of lessons! (Cushing rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always and looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not that thick and played a different role that I loved! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is scary here and did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always and unbelievable here, he is incredibly intense, very focused and as always he had an incredibly intense expression on his face, he was especially amazing in the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks is as adorable as the daughter, she is a bit scary and has one of the best children's performances I've ever seen !, Loved. I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as a babysitter. Jon Pertwee annoyed me here and was pretty boring and totally confused, he also had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and does her usual vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing well. All in all a must! **** of 5
