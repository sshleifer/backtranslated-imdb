The first two-thirds of this biography of the fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, as portrayed by Gretchen Mol with great sincerity, looks like a sympathetic guy from next door who has not seen anything wrong with what she did (and it certainly was not "wrong"). Director Mary Harron, who has also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," recreates Bettys America by mixing old black and white shots with new diminished black and white shots. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's fame was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor in a great performance and Chris Bauer) as well as with John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which he imitates Betty's bondage photography sessions are intriguing and skilfully executed. The first suppliers of fetish material are not presented too condescendingly and we feel that these people were part of a close "community". Betty never had too much of a problem with her fame, though we feel that her reputation prevented her from being legitimized in the righteous world. Since the third act of the film does not exist, we have the impression that we looked at a documentary on Betty Page, not a structured drama. Aside from the mistakes, it's a movie worth wearing, and represents another good pen in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.
