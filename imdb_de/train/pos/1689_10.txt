This movie is for Halloween what is the funny "Christmas story" for Christmas: both are relatively low budget films and not big stars ... and both are two of the absolutely best and funniest films available both seasonally CLASSIC !!! "Spaced Invaders" galloped from the beginning with warmth and humor and an outstanding cast of characters ... all five stupid Martians, Klembecker the broker, Russell the Deputy, Vern at the "tank farm" and so many more! You just have to watch this movie to believe it, and like "Christmas Story" it gets better and better with every movie and every time you take fun little things !! FINALLY ONE TEN !!!
