One of my favorite films overlooked by too many moviegoers, an observation that puzzles me. Not only directing the acclaimed Ang Lee, there were many young actors who were to become big stars; For example, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (in front of Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (in front of Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. The acting was great and each actor gave remarkable performances, especially Meyers, who showed a wicked villain who was killed to kill. If the biography and achievements of the director (even if he won an Academy Award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their previous appearances. I accidentally discovered the movie on DVD and became one of my most watched movies. However, it is rarely seen on cables. I'm looking forward to reading what others suggest, why this movie is not widely known.
