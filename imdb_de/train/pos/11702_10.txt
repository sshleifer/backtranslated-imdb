A thief in the night must be the best of all end-time thrillers. I have no idea what people complain about, what people complain about when they say that these films scared them into accepting God. They just needed an apology and accused A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! Not only do these films tell of one of the many tribulations, they are also fun in their simplicity. They are indeed low-budget and that's a little obvious, but not too obvious at first glance. I had no idea, because I had really assumed that many films like this, which were filmed in the 70s, always had low budgets. A thief in the night tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers, who lives for what awaits her until her husband and almost all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture that they all warned against. At first, the movie does not just spin around them until the Rapture happens. This results in everyone else around them becoming Christians and believing in Christ, which is usually what happens to many people. Everyone around them whom they once knew and loved will disappear forever, and the one who remains behind is the one who blames everyone but himself. Nobody can ever blame themselves because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Just like those whining complaining about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I'm thirteen and you do not see me whining, especially since I was just like Patty before I put Christ back in my heart. For those who have not seen it yet: If you want a little bit of everything to be thrown into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical, all the rest are wrong movies. Then you will enjoy A Thief In The Night. Do not hit it before you try. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
