Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil). Soldier plays in a landfill and plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell hardly saying anything title character, an "outdated" genetic soldier who is dead. The minor cast of colonists like Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and the surprisingly sprightly Michael Chiklis is capable of. They spend most of the movie being afraid of Russell, and the rest runs for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. Almost without words, he transmits emotions, feelings and meanings with looks and looks. It's almost a pantomime performance. When the action sequences get going he gets kicked - in a strong, quiet, factual way. There are shortcomings. Jason Scott Lee is brutally a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a great impression of Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​as a madly commanding officer, and Gary Busey tears his belly (and almost his belt) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated and excellent sci-fi movie recommended for anyone wanting to visit the second Universe of Blade Runner - David Webb Peoples has written both scripts.
