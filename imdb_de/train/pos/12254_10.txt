I saw this movie after seeing Paltrow's version. I thought that was a very good one, and I thought that was not so good ... but I was wrong: British version was much better and happier! I found Jeremy Northam to be more "pleasant" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong Austen's Knightley captures much better. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
