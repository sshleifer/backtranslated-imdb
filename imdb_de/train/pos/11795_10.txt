I'll never forget that movie or the events that led up to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic, but it has to be said. Powers Boothe give an outstanding performance as leader Rev. Jim Jones from obscurity to total madness. It would have easily given him an Oscar if it were shown in theaters. It's a kind of mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the brutality, control and obsession of the cult leader. His rise and fall and the threat from outside to destroy what he considered a paradise. The mass suicide is terrible and almost unreal to anyone, why so many people (900+) have volunteered or resisted JOnes's command. They do not do miniseries like these, where we have no more mouths open and are hungry to know what happened to the others.
