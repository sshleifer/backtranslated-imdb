Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of Indian films, Pakeezah does not fall into one of the traps commonly associated with Bollywood film (eg stickiness, farce, wholesale, and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes / genres). Pakeezah is native to the subcontinent and authentic, almost like a woman butterfly in action. Characters are well developed, direction, though not refined by today's standards, sensitive and persuasive. The urdu-speaking Milieux at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and how dialogue conveys the intricacies of time! Acting (especially the look and dynamics between the characters) is a joy to see, though the nuances may be lost to contemporary audiences or those unfamiliar with the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> Coupled with a captivating script is a beautiful musical score underscored by the protagonist who demonstrates outstanding mastery of classical Indian dance (Kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not let the audience say goodbye without the viewer feeling that he / she is part of a truly memorable movie experience. Pakeezah is certainly the culmination of what Indian cinema has produced, and it is unlikely that it will come in parallel.
