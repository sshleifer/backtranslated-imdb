Eytan Fox has done it again: move the viewer's heart into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming mess. The film also succeeds in describing the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv so perfectly and subtly. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and everything is there: the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart. The city, the chaos, the heaps of utopian mindsets in the most carefree, carefree and forgetful megalopolis of all time are beating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: There is a central homosexuality in the film. If you do not think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged, and finally consider it "just love." (And do not worry: the chick is hot too!)
