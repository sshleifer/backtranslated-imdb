52-Pick Up never had the necessary respect. It works on many levels and has a complicated but traceable storyline. The participating actors give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly staffed and provide deep character depictions. Also noteworthy is Vanity, who was said to have split her into a serious acting career because of her unexpected ability, and Kelly Preston, whose character haunts her for a few days. Anyone who combines action and a complicated story will enjoy it.
