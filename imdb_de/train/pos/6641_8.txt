On December 28, 1895, film history in the Grand Café in Paris wrote itself, while Louis Lumière presented his short films, all individual shots, a paying audience. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first movie to be played and I wish I was not only there to watch the movie, but also the audience's reactions. <br /> <br /> We start the Lumière factory with closed doors. Since the picture looks like a photograph, people apparently thought they were just seeing a slideshow, not something they had hoped for. But then the doors open and people pour home. First many women, then a few men and a man with a big dog on a bike. When everyone is outside, the doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first movie or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' was the first film Lumière recorded) is an impressive piece of early cinema. Boredom is almost impossible for a variety of reasons. A simple reason: it only takes fifty seconds. But even for people who normally only like the special effect films, here must be something interesting; Historical things like these can not be seen every day.
