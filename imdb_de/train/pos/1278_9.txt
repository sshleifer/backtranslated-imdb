"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that whips pop culture sardonic to humorous self-destruction. The characters are so interesting and it's fun to laugh about it. Which leads me to an introduction to the characters I liked the most ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 40s who is a pop culture editorial titled " The Next Big Thing does not really exist, and it's only an excuse for Simon to question actors by interviewing them, just to stupid them and insult them with their way of thinking His Darla-living girlfriend, Darla, also writes a magazine (which is real) that deals mainly with her and Simon, as well as her and her dad.Darla is a really loveable (or despicable) character, dependent Magda is a prostitute, I liked the character best, Brent is a flat character with little to it, as is Tedra, the music video queen of a group of B-rock bands Nevertheless, these characters connect a very interesting network. And this film questions all the motivations people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie, and I suggest you see it when you're in the indie / art house crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
