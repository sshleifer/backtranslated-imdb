1978 began a phenomenon. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" caused people to stand around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and went down as one of the greatest films in film history. Action: 15 years after a murder, four friends (all) women) babysitting (and having it with their friends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to persecute these people. He murders 3 of them quietly and subtly. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends flees after being rescued by Doctor Loomis (Michael's persecutor and doctor). <br /> <br /> There's a reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills and he scares us. These are the only reasons why we are afraid. John Carpenter wrote and directed the film. He builds unbearable tensions throughout the story and is so frightened that sometimes we can not watch. And the climax is really amazing. <br /> <br /> As a horror, this is essential. It's terrifying and well played. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> The extensions focused too much on Michael and his "story". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe this thing is therefore a masterpiece.
