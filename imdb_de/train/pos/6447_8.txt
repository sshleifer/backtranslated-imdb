The story involves the viewer from the beginning. Much of the film's success goes to the ensemble that was put together. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role, is the best excuse to watch the movie. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk and Ylva Loof are doing excellent work for Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music you hear. The cinematography of Harald Gunnar Paalgard makes the film look better, capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.
