The main problem with the first "Vampire" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a sympathetic vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is surely the coolest vampire since Deacons Frost by Blade. While there are some good concepts, like a cool slow-motion restaurant scene (why Carpenter did not use it anymore?), This movie is not nearly as good as it could have been. I expected strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting, nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example in a city) and was a bit disappointed. While "Los Muertos" runs faster than its predecessor, it is still catching on in some parts (though it's not nearly as bad as "vampires"). Similar to "Vampires" the highlight of this movie is not very intense in the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the above things may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but definitely not. It's generally fun and one of the better entries in the genre. It's not an unoriginal Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there), nor a dumbfounded action show like Blade II. It just might have taken a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see a third installment from Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING The end was far too predictable. Una should have gotten away - that would have made the movie quite unusual.
