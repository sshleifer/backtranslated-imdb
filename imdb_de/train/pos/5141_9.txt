I have to admit, I did not expect to see this movie in my Japanese film class, but this movie really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job performing the title of his film and is really a picture of madness. I think the fact that this movie is dumb adds to the lunacy and helps the viewer to experience the inner world of the characters, not the world outside of their heads. This film has made my feelings about foreign silent movies even stronger than Americans, as the foreign films are much more to train your mind and make you think rather than always go for the fluffy movie with the happy ending, and barely exercise the imagination.
