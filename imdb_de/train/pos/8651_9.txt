California came out in 1993 just when three of the four main characters were at the booth they own in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans, because he is dry and intelligent, narratives that find their way into his work, as in most of his episodes of X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries , People who were deterred by the strong southern accent of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters have obviously never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the South there is a "Adele and Fr√ºh" and in 2006 that's the true horror of this movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the movie was co-written with a cult film intention - as with Carrie's photography, she is not fit for mass consumption. However, if you have a copy of it in your personal library, I think that says something positive about your taste for crazy movies.
