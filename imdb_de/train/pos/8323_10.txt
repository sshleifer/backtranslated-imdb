"A little nonsense is appreciated from time to time by the smartest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful hustle and bustle, wonderful premise, period piece that was executed with great attention to detail. Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins and others - just wonderful! <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it with you, smile a little. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Then thank you.
