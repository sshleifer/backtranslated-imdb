Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force for nuclear power. Unfortunately, Rukh was contaminated by radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh goes insane with radium AND the antidote and wants to kill everything he thought was wronged The "effects" that make Karloff glow in the dark are ridiculous but this is still a funny little cooler. It moves fast, has a great atmosphere (note Rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) do great things. There is also good acting by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's OK, but only one notch among all the other Karloff / Lugosi films. The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Nevertheless, I liked that. I give a 7.
