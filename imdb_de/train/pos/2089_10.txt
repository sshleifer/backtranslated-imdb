"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you do not hear much about anymore. There are many great disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. All of this happens in just over two hours, which is short by today's standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the period. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role. She basically has only three feelings: submissive, hungry and heartbroken. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are terrific. <br /> <br />
