I'm tired of people judging movies by their "historical accuracy." IT IS A FILM! The authors and directors should bring their own history into the story! There are a number of films that are not exactly accurate in the story ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York gangs, Geronimo: An American legend, the last of the Mohicans ... all fantastic movies have been slightly inaccurate in the past. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and not worry about the truth of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the plot and one of the greatest actors of our time.
