I am 19 months old and tired of seeing Care Bears constantly. Rooney is a great dancer who cares if he's gay. This guy must have been a cheerleader or something. <br/> <br /> Beats Barney, I can not get the songs out of my head ... have to ... stop singing ... Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> Must have 10 lines of text so that I can continue ..... what if that all says Canadian stuff like OOOUT Aboooot. Whacky Canadians ..... Jazmine rhymes too much, she has to be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knock Knock, who is there, Dee Dee, super hottie? Bus driver Bob can not dance, take lessons from Rooney
