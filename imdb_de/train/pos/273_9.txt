It's hard for me to criticize something that Mitzi Kapture is doing. She radiates beauty and grace on the canvas and is a phenomenal actress. Nevertheless, the action was predictable. I think if Jill had slept with Richard, it might have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have increased the tension even further. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband learning about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a bit more backstory. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I would have liked to see more closure with Zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. I have to say that I will never see a flare gun and I can not imagine how she stands there. It was a very fitting ending for Richard. Of course Mitzi has rocked! I am looking forward to your future projects.
