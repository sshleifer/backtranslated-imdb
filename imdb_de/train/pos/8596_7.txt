I thought The Sentinel would be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I was a good surprise. The movie is not a great thing, but it's a lot of fun and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of television series like 24 or Alias. This series is very similar to the series and also reminded me of the thriller by Wolfgang Petersen In the line of fire. If you expect one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in the world history of the movies, you will be disappointed. But if you go with small expectations, you will enjoy the Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
