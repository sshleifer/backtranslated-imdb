The French Naudet brothers did something no one else did, they had a video camera on the day this tragedy took place. They were in Building # 2, when they saw papers slide down, people from such a height hit the ground. The camera was still running when the white dust covered them, they found a shop door and came in, but all the footage is real and I think they did a fantastic job for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who made this extraordinary film that I see every September 11th. I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe, if I recall correctly, it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was brought to church and his honorable burial.
