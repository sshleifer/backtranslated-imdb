Before Lost, everything that was shown on television was predictable. You could predict who would die or who would find something, but in Lost you can NOT foretell anything. Everything was so amazingly awesome and it was really a puzzle, not because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. I literally became addicted to it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. It's awesome The environment is brilliant, it's quiet and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a brilliant work, especially those already on the island. The Castaways are so dramatic, but we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say, and they have secrets that affect the other Castaways who die with them.
