Although the word "Megalmania" is often used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is far too stiff, one has to admit that the guy knows how to play a show. In American In Paris, he choreographs some outstanding numbers, some of which block the storyline but are still amazing to watch. (Look at Gene Kelly's "Getting Out Of Bed Routine.") Gene Kelly plays GI based in Paris, he stayed there to paint, and soon he's a rich woman's gigolo. but he really loves someone else! Hoary Story sure, but the musical numbers save the show here! I really loved Georges Guaryary's vocal work in this one. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful' is 'wonderful'. I can take Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron with me or go. All in all a pretty good, but not a dynamite movie.
