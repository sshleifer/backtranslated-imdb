It's hard to learn more about this movie without ruining it. I enjoyed it because I did not expect what I saw, but an ordinary sex drama ... It's a psyto-sexual thriller, where nothing is what it seems. It shows Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and nudity) into which her husband Polanski had directed her. And a scary show (I said scary / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like a Chabrol or Clouzot thriller (I saw someone mention Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franjus Les Yeux sans Visage (eyes without face , that.) Godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just afraid that they will turn this remake into a Hollywood remake, as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
