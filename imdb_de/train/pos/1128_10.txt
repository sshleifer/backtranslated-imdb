Although repeating part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once entertaining, "Iphigenia" with the fiery Irene Pappas is breathtaking. The unfolding in a natural environment with Greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity. A chance encounter with this film in one of the many film channels of DirecTV woke me despite my concentration problems. There is no sparkle or "bling" in this film, just a fabulously rich story perfectly told by actors. I even believe that Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this narrative. <br /> <br /> JLH
