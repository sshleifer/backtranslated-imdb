I saw this on TV last night (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this movie was surpassed by most other FN movies. I loved how Chip would be quiet in a moment and the next moment VIOLENT. It was classic. Ah yes, the ladies, the villains, the cigars and the proud police! It has everything. This film gave me all the goods. I especially liked the way they mixed communism into action. Very daring, also because blacklisting was popular at that time. I rate this movie as one of the best I have seen in the FN genre!
