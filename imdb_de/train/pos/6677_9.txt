A film about would-be, no-one and less than heroes, who manage it despite all adversities. Where did we hear that before? But if the unfortunates are the Shovellers, Blue Raja and Mr. Furious, then you know that this is not your usual story. <br /> <br /> A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P., one of the Disco Boys Guides and Geoffrey Rush, as Arch Villain shows, was the real idea in the casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance a curious choice for the role of Captain Amazing, proves to be perfect. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you fancy comic film stereotypes. Why can not rage be a superpower?
