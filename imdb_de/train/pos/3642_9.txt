I saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago, and it was introduced by the former Disney boss Eisner and the real Jim Morris. About a month ago he came back on TV and this time I took him in. Since then I have seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring, feel-good movie written intelligently and believably by everyone involved. It resists any sentimental trick in the book as well as any other stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see a movie in which the kids are not idiots and have a whole host of behavioral problems, and the jocks are not portrayed as testosterone-driven muscles. <br /> <br /> These are just ordinary people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood is because other extreme to what they call "grim realism", make films in which everyone is cursing and having problems with the aggression. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue this dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so personal that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid disappoints as usual. I saw him in the late 70's and he's so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has great benefits from ALL sufferers and kudos to the authors. <br /> <br /> A gem In the movie, the end is almost over when Jim trains in the Dugout before the big game and his wife calls him from the bleachers. He rushes over and reaches for his family. The faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the shelter are invaluable. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change then record this movie.
