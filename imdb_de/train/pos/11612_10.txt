Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been when Japanese men were taken around the turn of the 19th century to Hawaii to work in the cane fields. Most were planning to return home, but few were able to do so. Equally moving is the fate of Japanese women, some of whom were only fifteen or sixteen. They were sent as a promised bride to men they knew only through photographs that were often 10 or 15 years old or from another younger man. They also worked in the fields for a long time fighting their homesickness and fighting their dignity. <br/> <br /> Director Hatta's representation of the courage and perseverance of a bride who tries to survive in a foreign country and a foreign company under physical survival is ultimately forced inspiring and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival , Picture Bride stands out for its size and splendor, capturing both the enchanting beauty and the violent harshness of colonial Hawaii. This is a movie that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding.
