How great is this movie! I have seen it again and again and am always fascinated by it. The reason the film is so easy to recite is of course the impressive performance of the young Bette Davis. Not only does she steal every scene she's in right now, but in fact she's much prettier and better photographed (not to mention sexier) than in any of the films she'd previously made in her Warner Brothers home studio made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially in the dining scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so curvy when she was young. Get the cheap negligee she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh man, she is an absolute powerhouse in this scene. Howard is a bit too nervous, but he captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee scores with sweet, pretty young Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is charming and poignant. Splendid performances and taste of the thirties make this classic a must.
