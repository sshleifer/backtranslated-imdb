This was the best movie I ever saw about Bulimia. It hit the spot on what Bulimia really is about, and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting. It showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things like their attitude to life, their friends, and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It turned out that people with bulimia do not have this problem because they are dealing with somebody else. It only has to do with them and them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem rather than attracting attention. It turned out that at that moment Beth had to call for attention and at that time she needed her mother's attention the most.
