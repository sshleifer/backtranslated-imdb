I really enjoyed this movie as a kid. At that age, I thought the stupid baseball tricks are funny and the movie is "cool" because it's about sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed movie this was. As a young child, this film opened my eyes to the struggles other children dealt with and the real world problems. This type of exposure is largely absent in children's films nowadays, which in my opinion is not for the benefit of our society. Sure, the baseball antics seem really stupid now, but they attracted kids. No seven-year-old will ask about a movie about foster kids, but they'll look for a movie about baseball. Disney recognized this fact and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive to the actors who play both children and Danny Glover, who all did a fantastic job.
