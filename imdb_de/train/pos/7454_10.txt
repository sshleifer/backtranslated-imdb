** Warning - this post may contain spoilers. ** <br /> <br /> I only received a Gamecube in September 2005. The first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent Agent Under Fire and the boring Goldeneye rogue agent. The next game I planned was Everything or Nothing because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had. I have to say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it at HMV for a tenth, and when I got home, I beat it in my cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games and there was a much better and more interesting story. The graphics were one of the best I've ever seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics you've ever seen). The story was smart; The crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and the pretty henchman (Heidi Klum, as Katya Nadanova) try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots that you must destroy a train at the beginning of the game, James Bond. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's breasts. They must then thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that there are actually actors vocalizing the characters, such as Cleese Q. There are 27 levels, some short and some pretty long and tricky. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Playback Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a grand total of 90%
