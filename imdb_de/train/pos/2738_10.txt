I have not seen this for over 20 years, but I still remember it. <br /> <br /> This movie could NOT have been done in color. The gray shades of gray do that, and was life really so easy in the fifties? What strikes me most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows. His breath under the hood, just before they jumped the trap. I do not think I could look at it again ... once it is abundant. It's like an unnamed guy at the beginning of "Papillon," who is dragged out to the guillotine out of fear. The guy who said he saw this with a double count of "Dead Man Walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live". Some of my ancestors, who were "Aristos", went to the Guillotine 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are pretty intense.
