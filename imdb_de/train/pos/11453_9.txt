The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy's art, his search for proximity to land and water and his sense of proportion - and so gently he breathed it back so beautifully that she was filming for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work, connecting it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a fluid world, a world that keeps its power in mind. Watch this movie!
