This movie is just brilliant. The cinematography is good, the drama outstanding and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself liberal until he learned the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is absolutely convincing - so much so that Donald Woods, when he appeared on television a few years later, recognized him from Kline's performance. Denzel Washington also shows a masterful performance as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to see this. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, people, that really happened.
