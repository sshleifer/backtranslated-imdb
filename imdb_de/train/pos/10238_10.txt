People expect nothing less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg stages a film, and this movie is no exception. Some of the films I love were bad at the box office, but I'm glad to say that this movie is not one of them (over $ 9 million, which I was not bad at the time). The characters were funny, the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I did not think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for little kids (the target audience for this movie), but I thought that what happened to the scary professor in the end was a bit too dark for the movie , Overall, this movie is a fun and charming classic that I've loved for years.
