If you have not seen this movie by Mary-Kate and Ashley yet, all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?!". This is another great and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins we all know and love! It's funny, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (scenic). Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenes here anyway! Would a real fan have it differently? Of course not! Anyway; It's a great movie in the truest sense of the word. So if you have not seen it yet, you have to do it now! I mean now! So, what are you waiting for? I promise you that you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
