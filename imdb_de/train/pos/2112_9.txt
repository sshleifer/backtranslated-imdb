In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop. There she fights with her colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not get along well, because everyone has fallen in love with an unseen pen pal. Seeing how Ernst Lubitsch guides these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is a subplot involving shopkeeper Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. With the attitude of a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan realized painfully, "She just did not want to grow old with me," and the minor characters keep the movie old. <br /> <br /> ********* The shopping around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch - James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
