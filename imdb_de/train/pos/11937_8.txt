That was definitely the case with Angels in the outfield. It was on TV yesterday, and I think I had not seen the movie since I was a sophomore in high school, and I am now in my fourth year of college. Although the film has many shortcomings, it is so touching that you can not help but sit down, watch it, and have fun. It's also funny. Danny Glover's shouting is just so exaggerated that you usually have to laugh out loud. It adds to the movie and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You can actually feel the characters in the film, even if the development is not the best. Something you must have seen. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
