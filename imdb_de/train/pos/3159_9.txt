... and the series lets you forget it all. I am about three years older than the children of the series. I was born in 1958 and learned to drive during the first gas shortage. During the second gas shortage in 1979, I received my first degree after college. The 70s was a really terrible time to be young - inflation that rivals a minimum of post-school schools - job opportunities with laid-off thirties, horrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, this series ignores none of this and still manages to make the 70s even funny for those of us who are old enough to know better. It manages to face the '70s face-to-face with up-to-date clothing, yet it fills the show with the hopelessness of youth and the things that make high school and college years both the best and the worst , Then there are the parents. The two young lovers of the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - have really terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, though they're standard for the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally reached the suburbs in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their lives to legitimize their craziness. Eres friends, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complete the group and represent nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show on the suburbs, but he's largely representing someone who has to play the cards he's got even if those cards are spent by largely absent and negligent parents. I warmly recommend all eight seasons, even though Season 8 is lagging behind due to Eric's absence.
