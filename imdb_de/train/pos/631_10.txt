This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever jokes, great acting and a good dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and was drawn from its original plot (based on the novel I am now reading from Neil Gaiman) and its colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking things for me was actually how self-contained the story is. Unlike so many science-fiction fantasy films, which are currently open-ended and open-ended, this was a fairy tale that is in and of itself satisfying without the need for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Good imagination.
