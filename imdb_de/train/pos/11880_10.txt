"Scarface" has a big cult 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been described as very sticky, unrefined, exaggerated and bloated! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It's true that Scarface is far behind 'The Godfather' in technical terms (cinematography, script, directing, etc.). <br /> <br /> But it's also true that Scarface and another gangster lacks some movies, is the rudeness, the sheer rough approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more threatening and real than any polished Italian or Irish gangster from other gangster classics like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of Scarface's main draws, and I firmly believe that this fact has been written down by most critics as "stickiness"! I've seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I have to say that these two films are far too different and can be seen as two different films instead of praising the original over the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized in this film for exaggerated and loud. But how about, considering that this is exactly the way the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character? He is this angry young man who makes rash decisions and gets tantrums every other minute! He is not the quiet Michael Corleone here. He's Tony Montana, a very sticky, uneducated person who does not think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> There is definitely a feeling of the 80s in this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's Theme', 'Push It to the Limit' and the theme song instrumental. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly had the most fun playing Tony Montana in his entire career. And it really looks like he felt very comfortable in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would be without Pacino. I just could not imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana, and the movie would not be so effective with all the probabilities without it! Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there's some eye candy in the form of Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is appropriate in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes overboard during a certain part of the climax. Without betraying anything, I would just say that this is the only part that suffers from improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies that has ever surfaced. Enjoy it for what it is: a true representation of the Drug Lords and their gangland!
