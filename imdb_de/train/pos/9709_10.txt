For the first time, I accidentally looked at the LoG while I was walking with the television: since then, I've never missed a episode. <br /> <br /> It's very funny, like a mix of the Brass Eye's social commentary, the Fast Show is excellent one-liners and an amazing storyline that seems to evolve every week without going anywhere. The best example was Hillary Briss's special stuff - what was it about? <br /> <br /> The humor will not please everyone. Some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy to see where they're coming from. Try it anyway. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but if you like it you will be very glad that you have accepted my advice.
