I rented this a few years ago, the video library at that time had only VHS. Straight to the video, it hit his steps (you know where the cover pages use the same fonts and color schemes as for successful movies). I did not know what to expect except what was printed. The first thing I thought about watching was "What's wrong with the sound?" - Obviously, there was no synchronization of dialogues. The words echoed, and so I stopped talking about what I had to pay attention to, because this is not a Shakespeare! The story is simple enough, a boy meets a girl, etc. What I found humorous and heartfelt was that the people in the film did not look like caricatures written in the story, but non-actors who temporarily switched from their actual jobs (uniforms ) were robbed). Meanwhile, one starts to grasp what the filmmaker is up to, and then one sees that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people who violate their privacy, use vulgarities, which could not harm marketing.) There was something honest about them If they had a bigger budget, it would have been better, and I'm sure they were thinking about it on a daily basis, but they kept going and made it. In my opinion, that was what independent filmmaking is all about. "Indy" is thrown around as if it were a genre ... Ha! ... this is funny!
