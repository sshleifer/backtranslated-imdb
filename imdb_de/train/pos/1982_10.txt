This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I've been in stage production a few times, so it's still my favorite muscle and I doubt anyone could do the story of Oliver Twist on the screen again, better than he did. <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite '' Bad Guy '' must be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did he frighten the life of my life when I saw it as a six-year-old, but as a woman I can associate myself more with Nancy's character, the bar girls / prostitutes who help Oliver get the life he deserves. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde as the artful idiot was awesome, and I do not think anybody could ever outsmart him as a Fagin Street Quest Seeker and best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the numbers of Fagin. I'm also very thankful that they did not give Bill Sikes any musical name. It would not work if he was such an eerie character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job on Nancy's sticky ending. He considered him a G-rated movie, disguising her beating, but giving enough to show Bill's violence against her. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing-along and moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find out where he belongs in life.
