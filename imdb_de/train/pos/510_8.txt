I've been looking at this for the first time in a long while - I'd forgotten how imaginative the pictures were, and how funny the movie is. However, I had not forgotten the opening scenes, which (with the scene at the Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) are among the most romantic films ever made. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will love the film's uncomplicated credentials. Anyone interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the portrayal of posterity. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out", which was done at the same time - but this one is great. <br /> <br />
