Stories ?? whether written, visual or poetic epics? In general, try to avoid signs. After all, readers and viewers can become too overwhelmed when trying to track who exactly who is. This is especially true of the movie, I think, because we can not just go back to refresh our memory in a movie theater. However, viewers like me do not have this problem because we watch all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> One year ago, Audrey Tautou, a French actress whom I first saw for me, was introduced to me by The Fabulous Fate of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both subtly elaborate and complex stories with many characters. This former offer surpasses others in both areas: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Other directors have used these techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did so in 1963 with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, an almost epic comedy. The difference with this film is, firstly, the director "sees" the head of some characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated to refresh the viewer's memory, while the story flip-flops switch between different periods /> <br /> The basic ?? the core, so to speak? The story is about a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who is told by a commuter on the train that she will meet her true love that day. This happens in the first minutes of the movie. The smart irony at this point is that Irene is unaware that the young man (Gilbert Robin) can be the "one true love." And he does not go ... <br /> <br /> They go their separate ways without realizing the potential importance of their close encounter. However, there will be chaos for the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters as well, appearing in a series of intelligently constructed and interwoven vignettes that seem to be nowhere to go and yet ... <br /> <br /> If the story were just like that, it could be rather boring and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director will turn into a series of innovative scenes that are too commonplace but credible, extraordinary events that meet our expectations, and let the two possible lovers meet again. For example, the next time you drop a bird from the sky onto a book or onto your paper, you should consider your alternatives. Two characters make an obvious choice that must take place in front of Irene and her husband of fate. Or how about a rockfall that flies on your windshield? Think again what would happen ... <br /> <br /> All that is interesting enough. What was more interesting to me was the evaluation of each new man who came along and trying to decide if this guy was the one for Irene or if it was indeed the young man on the train. That made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about it, should you see this adorable fun. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
