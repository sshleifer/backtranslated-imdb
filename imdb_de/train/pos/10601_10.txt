This very funny British comedy shows what could happen if a part of London, in this case Pimlico, would declare itself independent of the rest of Britain and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. Happy chaos is what would happen. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents showing that centuries ago Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy, a small historical footnote long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live at will, free from any encroachment on Whitehall. Stanley Holloway is great as a small city politician who suddenly leads one of the world's smallest nations. Lady Margaret Rutherford is a joy as a history professor who supports Pimlico. Outstanding performers include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. Welcome to Burgundy!
