These things have been floating in my head for almost ten years. Some pieces of this work were really memorable. - I would like to see another more recent example of cg flashy stuff. Actually, I would like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had the opportunity to just say what I wanted and that was it, I would not have to write it all in the right order "10 lines if text" as this site requires. I'm serious? That almost discourages me, luckily for the guys who did the movie. I really liked Minds Eye - and it took me three times to have enough lines. - you have done it.
