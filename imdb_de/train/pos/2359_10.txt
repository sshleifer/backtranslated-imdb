I think if you ask most of Jehovah's Witnesses if they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I dont know. Instead, they will find that they believe the promises Christ made from a resurrection. Even if the worst happens and we die while maintaining our integrity, Jehovah can correct that and correct it. <br /> <br /> It really depends on one simple question: Is God really with you or? Is it all just believing? If he is real and you trust him, you will follow his instructions, no matter what the short-term result may seem. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about one and a half years ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters above my chart. I argued with her, if only I could only have a blood transfusion to save my life, would that be a good time to annoy me if the only one could bring me to life when the time came? She did not understand - God just is not enough for her. Too bad. I wish she could have the consolation that a strong faith gives.
