It's a good thing that I rented the movie before I saw the viewer rating from this page. It was a wonderful movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was wonderfully selected and Ben Affleck plays a good lead role. I would tell viewers who have not yet seen the movie that they should buy it. I rate it at the top with the Christmas holidays. The movie was very funny and well written, and Ben plays the eccentrically rich leader very well. The things he says and does is the way I imagine a person who has too much money to trade. The movie is much funnier than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. Plus, it has a good story and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, which means you can not buy love with money.
