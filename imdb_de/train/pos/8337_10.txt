As a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and having seen a large number of these films, it rarely seems to me that I'm considered unique. It is also rare that I have to gasp for laughter during several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I would say that's probably the best as this romantic comedy puts the emphasis on "comedy" and in any case just exceeds the limits of credibility I like most rom coms to do. The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this movie, but in every movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for a moment before finally choosing a "10" over a "9" rating because I believe that too many people are using them indiscriminately and thus losing some of the maximum rating. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen that I'd say is overly overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are the main characters, but for me they play a secondary role in the antics of hobbling intellectuals. A real laughing movie.
