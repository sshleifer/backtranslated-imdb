I picked it up from the library at random the other day, with no idea of ​​the cult, the influence of the film or the fact that it's being staged as a musical. (!) sad and yes, despite the best intentions of the filmmakers a bit exploitative. The extended Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can see the case of a class in little Edie that somehow disappeared, you can hear it in old movies by Jackie O as well. People just do not talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary film, it would have been interesting to get more information on how the home came into disrepute, Old Edie still seems to be at least aware of what is going on to some degree; could not she see the once spectacular home falling apart? <br /> <br /> But the theme of the movie is the life the two women have now built for themselves, a real Tennessee Williams act. Is it worth your time?
