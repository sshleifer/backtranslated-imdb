I know that this is not technically the greatest TV series I have ever made. I mean, it was shot on video and its boundaries are audiovisual as well as visual. Acting can sometimes be a bit crumbly show so much.it scared me the helliest when it first aired in 1988. Of course, I would have been 5 years old. But I recently bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately is now being deleted. Warner's was not released anymore because the first DVD was sold badly. The television program did not have the same feeling as in the movies. I even had the impression that she had a more sinister tone. Even the color palette is similar to the nightmare on Ulmenstrasse 4 (both the movie and the TV show were shot the same year), this has a rather serious tone, while the Fims became more and more sardonic and jokey. Not a bad thing, I like Freddy is the clown cracker. But I think that was the strength of this TV program. They did not have every moment Freddy The jokes make a joke before and after the death of a human being. In fact, this has more of a dream feeling, enhanced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it's intentionally being shot on video by the creators or only by the limitations. I love this show, and not taken as a companion to the films, can be very enjoyable. Much better than anything else on TV today.
