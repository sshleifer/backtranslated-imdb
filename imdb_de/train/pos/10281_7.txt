Here is my first David Mamet director. Fitting, since it was his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and it moves like any other Con movie, from the small drawbacks to the big drawbacks to the ubiquitous butts. It's like "The Grifters", but without the acting layer of this movie. (In this movie, John Cusack was kind of bland, but that was the nature of his character.) Acting here is very shallow (I sometimes wondered if Crose's stale drama should be a kind of assault on psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It never gets really good, but it develops after about ten minutes beyond the painfully stiff line reading. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - as she reads them - sound like they're an inner monologue or a tale of what they are not. Things will catch up with the arrival of Mantegna. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as funny as it should be. I've been expecting Crackerjack Ring a-Ding-Ding lines that roll off the tongue, but not these. It all sounds very read and not spoken. Maybe Mamet has evolved and relaxed after this film, but if not, maybe he should let others have his words. He is too valuable with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. Stranger is that the film otherwise does not look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too much like a filmed theater, but in this movie the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything was flowing. <br /> <br /> I would not mind if it sounds like movie characters talking movie lines - or even playing characters that speak lines of play - but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters talking game lines. It's a weird mess of theater and film that just does not work. That does not mean the movie is bad - that's not it, it's often entertaining. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's standard con-movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the dodgy con underworld. How she is there is: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him with his gambling debts, so she goes to The House of Games, a grubby game room where cheaters work in a backroom. I admit, the setup is pretty unlikely. (Did they only expect Crouse to come in? Did she expect her to write a check?) Was Billy there, but one of those questions will definitely be answered at the end.) <br /> <br /> And start from here to roll the disadvantages. I found the beginners - the little learners - the most fun. We get a lesson in swindler art, just like Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see how the end comes, and then we did not see the second end and then the real end that I did not see coming, but maybe you did. The ball just bounces back and forth and through the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse has entered the house of games where she has found her true vocation opening, the unlikely parts and the strange reading of the lines because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie is stagy, stick with it. After half an hour there is really momentum. If you want a funny Con movie, it's here. If you want Mamet, check out "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley has made him better. <br /> <br /> ***
