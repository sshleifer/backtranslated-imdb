Oddly enough, this movie never got on the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the release of the video. My expectations were high, but they were in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there's fantastic acting, a smart and exciting storyline that lets you guess and shoot great shots right up to the end. Together with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the two best Westerns of the 90s. People who expect something from Mel Gibson in The Patriot (Corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be angry. Disappointed, all the others who appreciate the above qualities will have a fantastic time watching. 9 out of 10.
