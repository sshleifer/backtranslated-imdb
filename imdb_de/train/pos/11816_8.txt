That was a lot of fun! I have never read these Chester Gould comics, but it is not necessary to know them. Maybe there were some inner jokes that I did not find out, but what the eye does not see can not mourn the heart. This is such an ironic, colorful film and the actors are all in a good mood together. The shot is similar to Batman, but not so dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is an action (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie you could play an interesting game look at it with friends. Do not look at the credits at the beginning, and then look for the quickest who finds out who the famous actors are under their make-up!
