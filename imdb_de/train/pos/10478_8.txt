<br /> <br /> This is definitely a "must" for those who occasionally smoke in their secret hiding place a reefer container and try to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, the police etc. The protagonist is a woman in her forties, who lived in her house, bred orchids and absolutely did not know that her so-called rich and true husband is actually broke and she is cheating. When he dies suddenly, she is confronted with the truth. The bailiff comes by to tell her that she has big debts. She does not know what to do until you tell gardeners about the recent success of marijuana in the UK. After much thought, she decides to get rid of her flowers and breed pot instead ... The story is quite original, the achievements outstanding! I can only imagine a few films that made me laugh more. The melodramatic touch is still there. The film is typically British: The jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended to make a few designs before viewing 'saving grace'. It will be so much more fun! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jawbones would burst. 9.10
