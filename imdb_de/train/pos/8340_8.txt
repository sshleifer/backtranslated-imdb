This is a really funny, airy, carefree romantic comedy. With Meg Ryan's sweet Perkiness and Albert Einstein's ingenuity you can not go wrong. Normally, I'm not a fan of fictional stories about real people who have died and can not defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein himself might have made a giggle out of this. <br /> <br /> It's the 50s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty, young, streetwalking mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who's ready to marry a stuffy idiot, a behavioral scientist named James, just because he has the brains she's looking for in the future. However, it is love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Since she does not think Ed is smart enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays matchmaker and is assisted by three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed appear adeptly smart, so he creates a charade that portrays him as a physicist ... of course with amusing results. Walter Matthau is his usual comic self and pulls off the character of Einstein pretty effectively. A lot of laughter follows with his three fellow professors Kurt, Nathan and Boris. The real Einstein had a real human side and this movie is only one (unheard) step further. If you expose all logic, you can almost imagine that this stupid story happens! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite its main character), but it's a wonderfully sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best comedy romances.
