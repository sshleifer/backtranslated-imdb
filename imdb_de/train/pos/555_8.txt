My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find room for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the US in February 1955. I saw him in March 1958 in Washington, DC, a "first run"? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a damn job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan basically plays the same role as before in Red River. And in my opinion, James Stewart performs as well as he always did. I've seen this movie half a dozen times or more and never tired of seeing parts of it again. The photography and scenery are magnificent and provide a remarkable entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
