I found this movie for streaming on Netflix and thought I would try it. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt), who have seen each other in succession, their father has died. Ryan and Theo first argue about who did what. But later, Theo learns that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but also dies of a deadly disease. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time improving their differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an incredible movie. I only saw Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal. David Cubitt, an actor I NEVER heard of before doing a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre. This is a movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars. Excellent movie!
