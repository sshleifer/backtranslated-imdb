I'm surprised how many people give this train less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> History is about growing up in a difficult environment. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there's a good reason why so many critics like this movie. <br /> <br /> And the reason is that they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the low ratings given by some people. <br /> <br /> I wish I could just write a short summary of A Movie, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I honestly have nothing else to say.
