This movie really woke me up, as if it would bring the male protagonist of this brutally different movie out of his sleep. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank employee from a small provincial English town to the stunningly beautiful, wild Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by an e-mail from Russia his life comes to become, according to John's plan, his beloved wife. However, a disturbance occurs - Nadia does not speak a word of John's language. Although outwardly calm and without emotion, he is interested in the beautiful Nadia, that instead of using the full refunding policy of the matching service, he buys a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What happens now? In the plot, poor John is really shaken from his slumber of a decently paid, secure employee to a decent-thinking, decisive action figure that conveys to the viewer a subliminal message "that you would probably have acted the same way". <br /> <br Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz form a great team representing Russians, and they are almost indistinguishable from reality, "almost" only due to the slight accent in their Russian dialogues, but so small that they are done a local Russian by the hard work of astonishing to make the words sound right. Nicole Kidman once again proves her talent by playing a character that, at least from the cultural background, is quite different from the previous roles. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to stop looking when the final titles appear, you feel more in the middle of the action and have the desire to Continued to see as soon as she comes out. <br /> <br /> go out and get this movie right away and watch it and enjoy it. In summary, it has an unusual plot, great spectacles and under-surface ideas. Like the idea of ​​"rude awakening" from the artificially safe routine life of a wheel in a social machine, the life members of the Fight Club wanted to give up, and the machine Pink Floyd sings off ("Welcome to the Machine")! I bet that in the end John was more on the way to the unknown with Sophia than not having met her at all, thank you, writer, for the great story and everyone else for that great movie! Please do a sequel! And you can stage it anywhere and name the place, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm convinced.
