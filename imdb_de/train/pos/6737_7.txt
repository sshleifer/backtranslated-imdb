The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were rehearsed for this solid policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a police officer in order to break all ties with the past, but can not keep his inherited violent methods in check, while interrogating suspects. One night he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the alien wife of his victim, an excellent war hero engaged with the city's leading thug and Andrews' # 1 enemy, Gary Merrill (himself the protege of Andrews Snr.)! As is usual with Preminger, this is a well-made film with a remarkable opening credits animated by a good cast that includes Karl Malden (as Andrew's acting supervisor) and Tom Tully (as Tierney's motor-maul taxi driver father) becomes Neville Brand (as Merrills Chief Thug), with notable support also from Craig Stevens (as a slimy, wife beating victim), Bert Freed (as a sympathetic partner of Andrews) and Robert F. Nolan (as a stern outgoing Andrews boss). He had already been warned by the latter to get better, otherwise Andrews panics for a few hours after the murder and incarnates Stevens to bring the police to the (in this case) false trail of Merrill. However, after Tully became the prime suspect (at the time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the policeman walks alone into Merrill's hideout and intends to let him push him and "frame" the bat for his own murder! The protagonist is clearly a complex character, and Andrews takes on the challenge with first-rate characterization, which is usually complemented by the in-house Fox Noir style.
