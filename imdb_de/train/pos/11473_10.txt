Zero Day is a movie that few people have seen, and what a shame that is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters come into the room and mercilessly kill people, then commit suicide and it has made me grab my stomach. I was shaking, so strong is this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's too unbelievable not to get a perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It's not a budget that makes a movie good, it's the feeling the creators use to do it. <br /> <br /> It leaves a permanent impression that you just can not get out. You realize the true horror of the shoot - especially when you meet that person, and in this movie you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to all those who thought they were mature enough to see it. I'm fourteen and think that this movie is just too amazing to put into words. It feels like you are watching something that has actually happened.
