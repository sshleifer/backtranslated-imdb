I love this movie and it is a wonderful example of family danger, a romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything was so perfect and excellent on this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actresses, and with a few laughs and many screams, this movie deserves many awards. With the mention of a beautiful scenario and although I would associate this movie with The Notebook and The Family Stone, he was much smarter, sadder and more brilliant than these films. The Evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger days, and her two daughters stay with her as long as she is not feeling well. The story that goes back is so narrated and wonderful that I sat on the edge of the seat. You really get to know all the characters and in the end I wanted to look at everything again. This is a surprisingly sad and vividly portrayed and plotted film that is truly unique and should be seen by all, because it is so wonderful. All the performances are amazing and the movie will catch your attention from the beginning and will never let you go. I loved it and I'm so glad I saw it because it was really an amazing movie ...
