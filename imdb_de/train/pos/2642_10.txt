This is really a heartwarming movie. It won the George Peobody Award and won "Roots," so you may learn something about the essence of this film. I am searching the internet for how to order this movie since my former father-in-law Eugene Logan, co-author of this movie, has passed away for several years. So I have no way to get information from him. I would love it when his only grandchildren, my daughters, see this movie and pass on this wonderful story to their great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old when she was on television, and I've been looking forward to seeing her ever since. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not "spoil" this movie for you.
