The budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to become a star becomes one and becomes too much. Good cast and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before. Some scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds like Mini Mouse! It disappeared shortly after filmmaking - so life can imitate art! A must if you want to see a punk version of Star Is Born.
