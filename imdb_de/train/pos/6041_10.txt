This is a few times to see. The excellent writing shows that they must have lived this story or had to know someone who did it because they did it. Freebird made me re-experience my forgiven youth and laugh. The title was a good choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movie, but it would be a shame if I did it that way. Funny, kind of like Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you've never seen TPB, make a point if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Episode? Could be done There is a whole lot more world that I want to see through their eyes.
