Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all the technical details (especially the cinematography) are sharp and the script is smart. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is terrific as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He is the legendary outlaw and is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are on the spot <br /> <br /> The film is marginal until the end. One of my favorite films from the late legend Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of every movie in which he played. And do not make mistakes here. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie.
