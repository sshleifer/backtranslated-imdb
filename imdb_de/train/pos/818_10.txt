The return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed part of the series and a good ending to the Star Wars saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the Rebel Alliance faces a tough fight against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can do it. <br /> <br /> The Opening Set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's Palace, a pit of slavery and scum and a new home for Han Solo, while Luke and the gang are preparing for his rescue, and with Lukas Jedi forces do they have the advantage <br /> In the end, we also experience a tremendous triple fight. Han, Leia and Chewy fight around Endor, desperately trying to disable the shields that protect the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet, led by Lando, fights with the Imperial Fleet as they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An epic ending to a classic saga, and it's just the tempo of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
