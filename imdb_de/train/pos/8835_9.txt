A sharp political commentary that represents the story of the coming of age is this movie. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. It's not supposed to, but it does. This story of four boys and one girl, who grew up in communist Belgrade in 1953, is a warm-hearted one. It's what gentlemen call classic cinema. Obviously, Belgrade 1953 is not as strict a dictatorial and fascist environment as communist society is often portrayed. You can listen to rock and roll music. One of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba", also the title of the film. However, neither jeans nor certain drugs that are illegal can be bought. Contrary to a strong criticism of a communist society, this film shows how it influences the lives of the five protagonists who call themselves four. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for his mother and she to accompany him, the piano taken from one of the boys from communion, the sudden giving of your house and your lodging to yours new comrades, because they need it. The boys spend a lot of their time listening to music and it is made clear that they despise the fascism created by communism when they engage with a fascist charlatan tattooing Stalin on his hands. All this leads to the actions they take later, and to the memory of a time that passed when this film was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie that is always worth seeing. "Repentance is not your enemy, but not a friend."
