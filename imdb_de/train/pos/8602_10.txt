With regard to Nathaniel Hawthorne, he used to say that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the same comment might be appropriate for McDonald-Eddy's pictures. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> It seems to have many features of a failed movie: it's kitsch, the censorship script sounds inconsistent? But this film also brings some good points: good music from Rodgers-Hart ("I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> If you do not like it, you can not forget it. In fact, this strange movie leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression, and you'll probably keep an eye on it for days or even weeks. Why? In the thirties and early forties, films did not have the same meaning as they do today: they aim like a dream to distract the public to forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream films that were made at this time, this movie is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that the best way to appreciate this movie is to look at it without wondering if it's good or bad. To see it as if you were seeing a dream.
