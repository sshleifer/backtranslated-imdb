That was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like Show 24, but in movie format. If you like the whole thing, we must stop the terrorist from killing the presidential film. Then you will enjoy this movie. Personally, I think the story was made way too much, but The Sentinel gives the mole in the Secret Service a small twist. All in all, this movie will not leave your jaw on the ground or change your life, but who says every movie has to be like that to be good?
