Ho, ho, killing maneuvers! This spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a big horror story from EC Comics is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis makes the most of a witty script by Fred ("Night of Screams", "The Monster Squad") Dekker, who focuses on a ruthless housewife with two bars (well played by Mary ) Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode, kills her shrunken husband on Christmas Eve (a cute Marshall Bell cameo) by slapping him on the head with a poker fire. Complications arise when a confused murderous madman, dressed as a merry Kris Kringle, escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestri's creepy, intoxicating film music and the typically polished cinematography of Dean Cundey add to the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (the sweet, gentle giant Benny in "L.A. Law"!) With his scary swallowing, a crazy sparkle in his pale green eyes and a grinning, really wicked grin makes for a sensational bloody Saint Nick.
