This one grew with me. I love the Burman music of R. D. Burman and despite the coarser elements of the story I found a lot of tension when I saw the movie again and again. The brother-sister plot is powerful, I thought; Probably there are also compulsory things, such as pub brawls, a criminal crime story, etc., which only distract. (From a certain point of view, but not insatiable.) The English translation, too, definitely came from someone for whom it was a bit boring, and as funny as it is, I'm grateful to him for doing it. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, this one is melodramatic and operational, including a song that was sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song 12 or so years later, the man who had traveled to Kathmandu to reconnect with this girl, grew up and worried (she had said that her brother and mother were dead) and drugged her pain. <br /> <br A great thing about this 1971 film is that it's about the hippie movement, which from an Indian perspective brought hordes of seekers to India who see them as human beings suffering from a mental hunger caused by failures was triggered by India, their own societies were driven to India, but still in India, who live only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie vocal, dance and drug scenes are really wonderful and in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I'm pretty sure the crowds of young, white, zoned children, As I recall, real hippie extras are listening to kids on the caravan in the East, who get that kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (It's not the actual Hare Krishna movement, though the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama song, as does a group of real Indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie.) <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
