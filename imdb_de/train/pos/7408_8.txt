I had the privilege to see this film at the Intenational Film Festival in Rotterdam. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low budget film about a father and his two sons. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where indigenous, mostly elderly men come to relax and bathe. The father has sons: a retarded son who lives with him, and a son who lives in a large modern city and comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathhouse and his "backward" brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Although the story sounds cheesy or clich√©d, it is not. With really great performances, especially of the father and the "backward" son (sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story that was touching and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch this movie. It's a great alternative to Hollywood mainstream cinema. <br /> <br />
