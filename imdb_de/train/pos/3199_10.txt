OK, I do not think Trailer Park Boys have bad storylines because they kick their asses. They only ... conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: At the end of the film, Ricky and Julian tell them to tell "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and leave. In the end, it shows Ricky and Julian that they have been in prison for two years. In the pilot of the TV series, the first clip they show is the same clip in which Ricky and Julian shout "Patrick Lewis." But in the TV series they were allegedly only in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, they give us the impression that the story of the film and the story of the TV series are linked to the screaming scene between the guys). But some actors have completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for annihilation, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), In the movie, the boys sniff coke instead of smoking hash. The thing is, they never confirm that the two storylines are connected anyway, except for the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry you keep babbling.
