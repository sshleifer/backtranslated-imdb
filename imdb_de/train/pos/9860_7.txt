This movie had no funny parts, mostly only average funny units, but also no really bad parts. The worst part was Sid's voice. His sloppy bow was just too much for me. After about five minutes I was sick of hearing him speak. Apart from the annoying sloth voice, the movie was good. There were numerous side jokes that greatly improved the movie when caught. This is a good movie for kids. It has enough to satisfy adults and enough to entertain children. It definitely pays to rent if you have children and want to see a movie with them.
