I'm going to limb and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good clip-show episode immersed in the battle for life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker, who fought a deadly disease. > The scenes from the flashback sequences pretty much matched the mood Riker was in when he relived his romantic episodes like "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments were highlighted, such as the death of Tasha in "Skin of Evil" as well as elements of the pulsating danger in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the already mentioned "Skin of Evil". Riker also showed courage under fire by telling some witty jokes, such as "An ancestor of mine was once bitten by a rattlesnake ... after three days of intense pain the snake died." This episode highlighted the psychological torment of Will Riker under extreme pressure. And, YES, in my opinion, I'm biased to proclaim "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode because my face was sweaty at the time of its original charisma and I wondered if Riker would live it alive. More great galactic adventures outside Of course, in the following years it seems to have come to a special opinion on this episode Award for "the best clip-show episode in the world." History of television ", then I believe that this episode should be highly regarded in this regard.
