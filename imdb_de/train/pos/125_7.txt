Lars von Trier is never tempted to try new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He describes post-war Germany as a nightmarish train journey. Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obliged to help rubble in so many cities to help with the restoration. It is not an easy task, as he quickly finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds a job as a Night Clerk on the Zentropa Railway Line. His job is to take care of the needs of the passengers. When the shoes are polished, a chalk is applied to the soles. A terrible argument arises when a passenger's shoes are not chalked, even though they were polished. There are many allusions to German fanaticism if you stick to such stupid details. The train ride is like an allegory depicting man's procession through his life with all his problems and difficulties. In a sequence, Leo dashes through the back car and discovers that they are filled with half-starved corpses who seemingly just fled Auschwitz. These images, as terrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible effect, but without connection. At a station called Urmitz, Leo jumps out of the train with a packet bomb. Considering many visitors, he connects the bomb to the bottom of a car. He returns to his cabin and connects to the time. Later he jumps out of the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass of a riverside. When he looks at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. When he then meets the train on a huge bridge, he runs at breakneck speed to the train and stops the clock. If you want to analyze the situation, this is a completely impossible task. Really ridiculous. It can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It's strange how one remembers small details, such as a series of cups hanging from hooks and rattling off as the train sways. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely admired, I prefer the later films by Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bombing scene described above really scared me off. Maybe I'm a realist.
