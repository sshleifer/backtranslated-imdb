LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000, and I doubt I'll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is located in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. For this the son has to open the record openings. What the father really wants his son to be because he himself never got on as a local news reporter for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film is best compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, though it is more dramatic and the humor is darker. Just like in this movie, the sound is more melancholic than depressing and the last impulse, without being unrealistically happy. The humor is absurd without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting of Poelvoorde. The actor became famous with the equally brilliant cult classic C'EST ARRIVE PRES DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he has played only two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting skills. With his return to a leading role in LCA, there should be no doubt about his actions. He's just as ingenious as a man stupid and angry enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he's done and to be torn to regret. Something you must have seen.
