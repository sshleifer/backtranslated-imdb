What's good about it: some original and really scary little effects that get under your skin even the most experienced horror fan. Do not rely on the trite soundtracks for his "Gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen it all, there are a few things in this movie that will make your chin fall off. <br /> <br /> What could have been better: Acting was at times flat and unconvincing. It had a shot-on-video quality in some places (though it mostly reached the desired atmosphere), and the camera work is full of unnecessary close-ups of pointless actions. Although the effects are really scary, I think they went to the well too often with some of them. The end seemed hectic and glossed over the most powerful moments. It is up to the viewer to discover many things for themselves, not as a challenge to the filmmakers, but because they have simply missed it. <br /> <br /> A good little indie horror movie that is slightly more than a few steps above average. The rent is worth it.
