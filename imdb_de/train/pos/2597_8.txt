Ulysses as a film should not be compared to the novel, since these are two completely different units. Nevertheless, the film manages to retain many of the elements that made the book work. However, since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to draw the stream of consciousness. I think that's the best movie they could do with the material ... and this from someone who regularly raves about movies not being like their literary colleagues. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.
