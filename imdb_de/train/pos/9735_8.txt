Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people." The underlying romance in the storyline is largely superseded by a much more interesting story from Rags to Wealth. Although the central line of the story is a bit overdue, in several screenshots it has a sense of; to get rid of the "bare necessities", to focus on those key relationships that make "office politics", and to use these almost irrelevant scenes that are purely used for the comic effect. But it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very smart, plays well on the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his co-stars, and blurs the cross between the high-low and low-life companies quite well and quite refreshingly in an act that despite Predictability something unique is travel. The different characters of the film are well presented and the casting is definitely a plus in the movie. Both the "trading place" relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Haze work so well in a story that is charming for lack of a better word. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course the sex appeal, shocked with a rather dark character and plays this "bimbo" role all too well. It's one of those films where every detail pays tribute to a big piece. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack, everything mixes in a way that can only be described as a clever comedy.
