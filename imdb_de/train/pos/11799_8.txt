A well cast summary of a real event! In fact, I was not there, but I think that's how it could have been. I think there are two typically American points of view that are evident in the film: "Communistophobia" and parallels with Adolf Hitler. This should be obvious to most independent observers. In any case, Boothe does a great job and many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - and I'm serious! Who can sleep well after that is abnormal. (That's why it's so horrible - everything happened and it probably looked the same). But in fact this last scene in the air station actually took place?
