This heartfelt comedy confronts some bizarre characters. Especially the two main characters, of course. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could no longer bear his cleansing and cooking attacks. So he tries to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, a messy, unreliable sports reporter, who is separated from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment. He offers his desperate friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon anger begins, because two such opposing characters can not live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar's disorderly apartment into a clean showroom. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short time, Oscar senses persecution ... Filmed in a theatrical way and played excellently. Especially the game of Jack Lemmon is wonderful. He is the perfect clown. He makes us laugh, but in a tragicomic way. Watch the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbors for dinner, because Oscar has to touch something softer than a bowling ball. While he prepares the drinks, Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he begins to talk about the weather. One minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he starts to cry, and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three weeping people in the living room. The movie is full of such amusing and touching scenes. A smart, entertaining comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
