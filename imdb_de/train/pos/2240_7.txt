My enduring love for the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who in 1965, with my appearance in the "Thunderball" had advanced my puberty, has taken me to quite unusual places. This 1959 British curiosity, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", shows Lucianna in one of her earlier roles. She plays a princess here, though the picture is indeed a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point. In this cute, often very funny movie we learn about the Madeira-like island state Gaillardia, which until 1916 was a British colony and then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage, when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there and Her Majesty sends the clumsy Carlton-Browne of the Foreign Office. Terry-Thomas underlines this part well, as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the small country. (This was Sellers' second film in 1959, which was about a tiny country involved with the world, and the other part was, of course, "The Mouse That Roared.") Ian Bannen almost steals the show as Gaillardia's beloved king, and my girl Lucianna is as appealing as it can be in her supporting role. The film shows a lot of dry humor, although there are a few tummy chops (for example the reception at Gaillardian airport and especially the Gaillardian Maitag-style parade). Sellers's crazy Prime Minister, with his broken English and seemingly eternal sweat marks, is another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite occasional or unpredictable or incomprehensible British whims of the stiff upper lip, I found that this image was a moderately engaging conversation and was well presented on this crisp-looking Anchor Bay DVD.
