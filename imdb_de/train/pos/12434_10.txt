For a first movie in a proposed series, he achieves the right balance. The style and class show Modesty's early days as a refugee and the beginning of her rise to the criminal world. I think it's a very honest / true portrayal of her character exactly as writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is breathtakingly beautiful and an excellent choice. She is very convincing as a tough survivor with a cool / intelligent / innocent look. And for Tarantino the full score, because he has selected an unknown actress for the role - much more credible to have a new face, the role plays. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
