I've lost the count of how many reviews I wrote about Slaughter High. I've read a lot of bad ones and I'll say that this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore soon became famous for his well-known suicide, and although this was his only movie, he made the movie so great. At first, I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. Then I learned from the current website at www.IMDb.com that he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character that man knows, but his true self certainly had strengths and weaknesses. He has done a good acting job, who can not agree? I've always wondered how he showed himself naked in a movie. That was pretty embarrassing, to say the least. I saw this movie for the first time when I was in sixth grade 12. I agree with some pointers on how the girl would not take a bath after the assassination and that the high schools have NO bathtubs! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star who had a dignified acting talent, and unfortunately he made no future films for Simon's death. The reasons for his suicide are a mystery and will hopefully be discovered in the near future. If you do the math on his website, you say he was 29 when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror movie. Probably because of their terrible acting, the others made no fame in the film business. -Jacob Young
