THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegant, costumed and reproduced piece of history that benefits from some fine backdrops, solidly directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e of Julian Fellowes version of the adolescent girl who was to become England's longest reigning monarch Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part in which Victoria is a child whose rise to the throne is challenged by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), seems to be lost in the rich costumes and landscapes variations. As soon as Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is wooed by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the movie flourishes. Blunt is a strong actress and finds this delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity, which makes her a good foil for those who want to control the "Children's Queen" in court - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen, her gaze looks on the sprightly German Prince Albert, and a love affair that lingers in everyone 's memory is accompanied by the concept of joining forces with concern for caring for her subjects Sensitivity of Albert. The film leads us to the birth of her first of nine children and ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's influence on the various royalties across Europe! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and lets us appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid, if he does not transport an epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
