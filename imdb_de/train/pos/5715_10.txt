Karen goes to a Japanese house as a replacement sister to Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing noises as she encounters a terrifying ghost. She will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It is very scary! The scenes are shocking and frightening! The characters are good. The settings are scary. I love the whole story! The end was shocking! I stopped at a scene where the little boy meowed so loud that the man upstairs found his sister and I was shocked. This is the scariest movie I have seen. I have not seen the Japanese version. I recommend horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
