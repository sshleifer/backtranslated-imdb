I really like this movie. It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal, the story of the prodigal son. But what I like best is that the bathhouse was more than just a background to the story. When the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing became an almost sacred ritual. Water was so scarce that a simple bath had deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very effective. However, there were times when it was "too sweet" ... and bordered on bobbin lace in the park recital scene. But overall I can highly recommend this movie.
