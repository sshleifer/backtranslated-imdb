This is one of the best comedy ever! The writing of this soap parody is brilliant and the cast, just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it's so great. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, he (as always) does a fantastic job, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
