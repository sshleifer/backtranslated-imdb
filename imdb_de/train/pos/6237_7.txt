Oh dear, from the box description I thought it was LA crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl has to be a very strong man. Most would have driven away a cliff or at least committed a mass murder. I admit to watching only the first half hour (for now). If I read all the comments here, I'm really looking forward to it. Professional reviews often refer to Swedish film songs from the second floor as a parallel, but that is characterized by humor and imagination, which does not let up in his grumpy realism. What did the Marshall Plan and the EU do? Seeing that with a friend in a theater would have resulted in a forced withdrawal after a few minutes when I got through to DVD. There is a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the hitchhiker from hell. Whatever happens to you, it's not enough! Soulless suburbs that I thought existed only in Arizona and Florida thrive in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought sex clubs in New York and San Francisco had ceased to exist, and here they are in suburban shopping malls? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western Civilization, "Why would that be a nice idea?" If the world were really like this movie, bring this black hole, we're ready.
