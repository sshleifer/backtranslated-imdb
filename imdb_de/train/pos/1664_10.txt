I found this film breathtaking, with absolutely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with careful but familiar mannerisms, and her hands show an idea before they place their models in motion. The passion that Artemisia devotes to her art is simply spectacular. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was obviously beautiful, the movie became more realistic because facial hair and clothing were perfect for that time. <br/> <br /> Overall, I found this movie fantastic.
