I saw this movie on the late show about twenty years ago. I still vividly remember the movie, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor, as most critics thought him a solid, almost boring style of leadership. Women simply appreciated his films because of his looks. However, this movie has shown what an interesting actor he could be. He did not get enough roles in his long career. This is his best performance. He absolutely believes in a truly spiteful role. From what I read, in real life he was a very hardworking and straightforward guy who never fought enough for these roles. Basically, he would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have coped with more varied and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but that character really made me worse. The last scene of the movie has stayed with me all these years. This movie is definitely worth a look.
