In the conception of a great film that explores the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic setting of Galiano Island off the coast of British Columbia, _The Lotus Eaters_ is clouded by the fact that it was packaged as a television movie the addition of dubious music to potentially powerful scenes to prepare for the disruption of advertising. A real shame.
