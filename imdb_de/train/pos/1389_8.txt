The Williams family lives on a ranch in the middle of the remote desert. They are greatly endangered when the place is suddenly pushed into a time vortex in which past, present and future collide in wild, chaotic and unpredictable ways. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film with a compelling, mysterious note and gradually becomes stranger, crazier and more exciting as the story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with many dazzling images and manages to create a true sense of awe and wonder. The admirably sincere acting of a game is another big plus: Jim Davis as hearty patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his happy wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as worried Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovable wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny and Scott C. Kolden as the brave Steve. The funky special effects feature an inspired combination of intricate miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (these creatures include a tiny, spindly hairy guy, a big, lumpy, catching animal and a skinny lizard dude) and pretty matte images. The thrilling orchestral score of Richard Band really hits the rousing point. John Arthur Morrill's sharp, sunny cinematography also does it. A funny movie.
