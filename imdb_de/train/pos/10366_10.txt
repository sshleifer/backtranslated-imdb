An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film recalls the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill is Strept for Line and Take for Take - it's one of the best showcases he's ever created for his great acting talent, and despite his intense role, he's in his sexy and grandest form. This gripping movie is a treat for any film fan who loves a gripping court drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental expressions. The award-winning Australian film not only offers a stellar cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian venues. It proves that people are the same everywhere in the world. And after all these years, people are still enjoying repeating the famous Streep line with accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including the goblin "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
