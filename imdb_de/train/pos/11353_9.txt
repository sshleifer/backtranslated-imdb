This movie was excellent. It describes the struggle between a committed detective against the committed ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I give high marks to this film because it is an undeniable insight into the emergence and development of forensic investigations in a globally isolated (thanks to "regime") community. This is a graphic movie. It shows an unsensationalized image of violence and it remains tragic. Nothing is covered in exaggerated blood or bloody blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I'm familiar with the true story to get a deep appreciation of how real the movie was. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must.
