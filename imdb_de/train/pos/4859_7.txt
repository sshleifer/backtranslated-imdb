I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and refused to play in distress with Fred Astaire in Damsel. Jessie Matthews in prime years did not leave her side of the pond to make American music films. IF they had teamed up for this film, it would have been a one-time event. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because Damsel in Distress has everything else to offer. Fred Astaire, History and Author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy and songs by the Gershwin brothers. In answer to the question asked by Nice Nice If you can get it, there is not much you could ask for this movie anymore. Except a leading actress. Although Ginger Rogers has made several films outside of Fred Astaire, Distress is the only film that Astaire has made during his teamwork without Rogers. The young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogers does in these movies. All she has to do is act sweet and reserved. It also does not contribute musically. And if I had to rate all the dance partners of Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine would be at the bottom. The poor woman is just awful in the number of things that look up. <br /> <br /> Later, in a musical starring Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it's no coincidence that Fontaine has nothing musical to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is more colorful and in this case I believe that it actually did something good. The idyllic green English landscape of P.G. Wodehouse is really released in this VHS copy. Especially in this number, which I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen, on the other hand, as a few old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number. The surreal Fun House sequence is beautifully staged. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy stands with Constance Collier on their haughty high score and once with Montagu Love as Fontain's father as a nice man in the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day Most famous song about the British capital since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Made in the simplest and most elegant way by Fred Astaire, it's one of those songs that will last as long as London. <br /> <br /> Facing the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, a damsel in distress a classical, classical score, classical dance, classical comedy. Who could ask for more?
