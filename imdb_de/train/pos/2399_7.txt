This was a success at the South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin last year and includes a fine cast led by E. R. Gloria Reuben and a landscape-eating John Glover. Although the film was filmed in New York on a small budget, it looks great and sounds fabulous. He takes us behind the scenes and whirls through the rehearsal and climbing of what actors call "The Scottish Play" as an indication of the word "Macbeth" thought to bring the ancient curse of the game. The drama company shows all the emotions of the game itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and also a bit of fun. The games begin when an accomplished actor (in the lead role) is replaced by a familiar "pretty face" from the TV soap opera scene to attract a larger audience. The green-eyed monster takes over the drama from there and unfolds nicely. Fine soundtrack and good performances all around. The DVD contains director commentaries and some deleted scenes.
