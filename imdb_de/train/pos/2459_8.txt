A beautiful and touching film that deserves a broader view than it is likely to be. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold. Aika's martial arts experience is not at home with her moderate conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, a struggle to find herself and the power to allow herself to be who she wants to be, despite her family and of her friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative with depth without becoming a cumbersome philosophical discourse, and using Xian Gao's choreography skills pays off in spectacular combat sequences. In the end, however, it is Semra Turan's impressive debut performance that gives this movie the spirit. Raw charisma and the necessary martial arts skills are heartily added to make your personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
