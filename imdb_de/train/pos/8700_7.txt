This movie has a great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. In the end, it wavers as the story turns a bit extreme. But overall, I would only recommend this movie just because it has the good old Russian feel. Tall, impressive, powerful, dark and brutally beautiful at the same time in the old tradition of tragic beauty. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A guy who lets a blade shoot out of his hand at will (no spoiler, since he shows it in the trailer), if he's REALLY mad at you and trying to have a girlfriend. He discovers that it's hard to maintain a stable relationship after killing a person with your sword hand. <br /> <br /> Sword Boy is on the planet for a reason ... he just does not know what it is ... STILL. <br /> <br /> A lot of dark street fights with guys who are unexpectedly filleted creatively. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. Slick worth a watch ..
