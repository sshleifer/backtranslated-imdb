Giallo fans, looking for this rare movie. It is well written and full of all kinds of the usual, low lives that populate these films. I do not want to reveal anything, so I do not say anything about the conspiracy. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or who you suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen this movie in English is from the European Trash Cinema for $ 15.
