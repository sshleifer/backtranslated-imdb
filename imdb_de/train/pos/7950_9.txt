First and foremost, I loved Bruce Broughon's music score, very lyrical, and that alone added to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film were the three animals, which were excellently voiced by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the weirdest lines, Ameche plays a rather brutal, stimulating figure (the voice of reason), and Field adds joke to a character that's always seen when they make a shot. People were not so captivating, and sometimes the movie moved, but that's my only complaint. This is a beautiful looking movie, with nice close ups of Canada, I think. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a really boring moment, and this is helped by the language work and a well-written script. All in all a charming and maybe underrated movie with a 9/10 of me. Bethany Cox.
