I bought it cheaply from the rental test in our local shop. It was almost new and I had never heard of it. Obviously, nobody else had. I can not believe my luck. They go through the whole range of emotions and try to overcome a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphant attitude of the Mandela party. Despite its enormous length (I had to watch it in two sessions) - it was like a book you could not put off. Maybe the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of the thing shines forever. I can not understand any comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I have seen "South Pacific" and also read the book and can guarantee that Musical is not realistic compared to the book. I'll appreciate this little find until it's worn out. One day they will do this again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
