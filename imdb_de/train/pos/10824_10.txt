"Still Crazy" is without doubt the biggest rock comedy of all time. It was falsely compared to "This Is Spinal Tap," to which it has no relation. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, frankly, not very good, despite the "excursion" of many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Tap," "Still Crazy" is populated with great actors, great songs, and great human situations. They take care of the people in "Still Crazy". That's all that counts. Oh yes, the music is damn good too, written by Mick Jones from Foreigner and Chris Difford from Squeeze. The American audience was already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later became familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Films).
