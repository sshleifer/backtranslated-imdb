I love this movie so much that I'm never tired of looking at it. The only line I really do not like is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but otherwise everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles, and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the Ramones were until she made that movie. Most of the people who see this again and again are fans of the Ramones and that is the only reason why I love it so much. I never tire of seeing DeeDee mess up his pizza lines or Joey mess up the teacher's name again and again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is to watch them sing. Want to dance? In the corridors of high school. I love it. The Special Edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly PJ Soles is not there. Maybe she was working on another project. * Laugh * Anyway, great movie, even better, if you're a fan of Ramones.
