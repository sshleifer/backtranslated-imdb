This is not the funniest movie I have ever seen. Starting with the four delinquents sent by their fathers to the Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set that continues steadily throughout the goofball film, and it does not leave a second to describe this film; The elements of humor are so precise and brilliant that at first glance they appear nothing more than a stupid comedy of the eighties. But it's so much more than that! The Academy Up the Academy offers a mix of style and style that I've never seen before, as if someone had released the "funniest" Hollywood offer in the past few years. Basically, the movie is so full of infantile corncob material that one might suspect that the authors themselves were a few 14-year-olds. Watch this movie if you like "immature". A classic. *****
