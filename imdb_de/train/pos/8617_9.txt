"GI Samurai" looks like Sonny Chiba and some other men are being transported back to feudal Japan plagued by civil war for no particular reason, and there is too much slaughter. It is a rather exaggerated essay of sword against machine gun, which ultimately leads to interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot basically runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("What's the flying metal case?" etc.), "Are not we better off," discussions, and ultimately, a huge fight. The latter is proof that the film does not take itself seriously. The bloodbath takes up most of the second half as the Samurai army fights against Chibas train. A face that one would expect from the title can still overwhelm it with its ingenuity and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique combat sequences of its time and does not attract despite its longer length. <br /> <br /> Chiba does a rough job as an Iba, first a good leader, but someone who eventually questions their own morals as the situation slowly affects him. This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his grandiose CV. In the last act, the two worlds had influenced each other so much that one has to wonder if there is a bit of nihilism on the part of the authors, as they seem to ask, "Were not we better off then?" But this may be a bit of reading, which can generally be described as a very entertaining two-hour (almost) non-stop action.
