I visited Fever Pitch with my mother, and I can say we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy in which someone longs for each other, and blah blah blah ... They did not wait for the first climatic kiss or for the fact that they finally come together. It was more real because you saw her through the relationship and not the whole film about getting together. People could actually refer to the film because it did not seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really funny and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
