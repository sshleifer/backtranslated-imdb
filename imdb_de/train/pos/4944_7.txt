Not so many things happen in this movie, but many meanings. The woman believed she had everything in her life she could, but that was not true, and she found out herself when she met this person doing some research for her next job. There really should be more types of films like this, I'm not even as old as "mature" (by the way 13) and I still had the idea and the meaning of the movie. The most important thing in my opinion is: DO NOT THINK THAT YOU CAN NOT LIVE BETTER, ONLY THAT YOU WANT TO DO THIS NOW. <br /> <br /> Although I had to admit I was watching another movie After reading all the reviews and watching the trailer, I decided to do it, even though I did not know that much action would be in the movie , I recommend everyone to watch this movie, as it has very good points in the movie and has a really good ending.
