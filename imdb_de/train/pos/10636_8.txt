This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last harem of the Ottoman Empire. It is well narrated and stimulating that we see the inner workings of a world that has now disappeared, and learn more about the people who lived there enjoyed the story, characters, drama and scenes. Some scenes suffered from a fast cut and the subtitles sometimes disappeared too fast, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Safiya is wonderfully played by Marie Gillain, who, I think, did a fantastic job without exaggerating it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and gracious. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something less Hollywood and more authentic for the world he is imitating.
