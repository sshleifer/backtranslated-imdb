The 4th Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Dare not say that Pokemon is shit! I do not like it when people say that ... I have liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, please say straight away that Pokemon is great and should be appreciated by people of all ages. And why do Pokemon haters give low scores to all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand ... you should not do that ... There's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon, besides the fact that: 1) Pokemon is just for little kids, crap is. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
