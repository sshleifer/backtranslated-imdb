I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It was something I could watch over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I can say very convincingly. The film shows how women should work for what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and yet so much hate. Dealing with an ignorant father did not really help her. Although he loved her, he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and that also brought some sadness into the role. The love story was a part that I really enjoyed in the movie as well. I felt the passion you had for each other. Then again a drama sets in and then she chooses between her boyfriend and her lifelong dream. I thought it ended right. It was the kind of end where you have to decide what happened to you in the future. For anyone who loves a movie based on a sport that promises a good plot, I would suggest you watch this movie
