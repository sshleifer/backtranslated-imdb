I like movies that do not offer the typical "happy ending" and that is my main reason for my preference for this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are being arrested in Thailand for drug trafficking after an anonymous tip was called to the Thai authorities. The movie makes sure the audience is guessing whether (or which of the girls) was involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as a sloppy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim does a great job as his kind, generous wife, Yon, who's also a lawyer. I wish the girls had been mistreated more in prison, as another commentator suggested, as I've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. But where this film grabs me is its end. Alice submits to a total of 96 years imprisonment so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the audience) realize that both are innocent. Any movie that defies my expectation of the end wins extra points with me, and this well-played drama is certainly worthy of a lot.
