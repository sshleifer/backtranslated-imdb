This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic representation of rural ranch life that made up much of American history. The backdrop is Wyoming in 1906, where life has not changed significantly since the previous century. The movie retains your interest without the additional Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this film and be fascinated by what life in America looked like when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film you escape the present and experience the everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, scenic setting, you'll see the hard physical labor needed to survive, the constant worries and worries of the elements, and the market pressures that make a difference between success and failure. Watch this movie and experience life the way it has for most of our country's history. This movie is worth your time to see. My only question is - why are not there any more movies like this?
