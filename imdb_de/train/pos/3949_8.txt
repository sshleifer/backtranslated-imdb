Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when it was first televised in 1971. Certain scenes remain in my memory and a sense of restlessness is, as I recall, that I was affected by it. I would be intrigued to see it again if it were ever made available for home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I'm wondering if anyone else might agree that the basic plot setup and characters may have been derived from one? The British movie of 1960, originally titled "City of the Dead" , was Horror Hotel's name for the American release? There are also some similarities to a later British movie The Wicker Man. <br/> <br /> A detail remains with me years after the film visit. It's a small but significant moment at the beginning of the film. As far as I remember, around 1870, a minister and his wife helped some people along the road somewhere in the west. The friendly-looking Ray Milland introduces himself and his (daughter?) Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher helps Ray Milland with the car, a rattlesnake comes into view and curves threateningly, without being observed by the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She does not look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration until she disappears. With this weird little moment, we realize that these seemingly normal people are something very unusual, though the potential danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> This little scene stays alive with me after all these years, along with many others. The film has a haunting quality that does not let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make this available for home videos!
