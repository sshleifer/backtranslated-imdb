This movie totally surprised me. I have seen it two or three times. I really liked this movie. There were many truths in this movie. I love all the characters in this movie. This movie makes a lot of sense because the company continues with increasing advance. What is the culture losing? Do not sound like a sermon. I can really relate to this film, my childhood hood, and my life, which will never come back or never be the same. This movie is on my top 5 movies I've ever seen. There is such a raw truth that I feel when I see the movie, and it is not the kind of truth that you have to seek before your face for its right. The creators of this movie have done a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. While this movie may not be for everyone, if you're open, I think you'll love it.
