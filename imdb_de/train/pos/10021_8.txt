This story, based on two Edgar Allen Poe plays ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Totentanz" (poem)), is pretty scary from beginning to end. It resembles some of the old black-and-white films about people who meet in an old run-down house (eg, "The Cat and the Canary Islands," "The Old Dark House," "Night of Dread," etc.). Boris Karloff plays a crazy inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the movie (or?) And the residents of the house are exposed to a series of terrible experiences. I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but it's definitely a must for fans of old dark house secrets. <br /> <br /> Look at it with a lot of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
