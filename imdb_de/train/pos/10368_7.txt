Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. She has an incredible sense for accents and shows incredible dexterity in this film. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She was also played realistically. She became angry, upset and uncomfortable as the media and the government continued their relentless witch hunt. I did not expect much from the movie at the beginning, but I was really interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neill was also outstanding. This is the best work I have seen of him, and I really liked him in other films (eg The Piano). I gave the movie a 7, but if I could just rate the acting, I would give it a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
