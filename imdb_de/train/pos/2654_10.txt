Everyone should totally see this movie! It's scary, but it does not go back to lame "jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" stuff. It's really great. See this crazy fantastic movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, by far the best director ever to live. Each of his films is a masterpiece, too. The Shining is about this family who goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies to take care of winter and getting snowed in. Well, the house is being followed. The boy is psychic. The husband is easily affected by badly persecuted hotels and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not really. It becomes a gripping thriller where things are thrown at the viewer from all directions and it gets weird. Not just the classic scene "Here's Johnny". It's memorable but can not speak for the whole movie. It's one of those things where words do not adequately explain and you just have to see it. So go ahead with Netflix and get it! GEEEEEATTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
