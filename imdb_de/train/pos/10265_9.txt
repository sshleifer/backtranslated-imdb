Unique film about the confused woman (Lindsay Crouse), who interferes in sharp frauds. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the most glittering of the group. Absolutely enchanting first hour when Mantegna Crouse shows "the ropes" of his con games. The story disintegrates a little later, but is still a unique depiction of an innocent being in a dark world. Definitely worth a try.
