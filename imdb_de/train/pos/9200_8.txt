I have read countless articles about how this game is so similar to Max Payne. When I played it for the first time, I thought it was a weird arcade-like game with the desire to break off Max Payne style (not just ball-time). When I played it for a few hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how different from "Max Payne", yes, the enumeration time is a bit similar, but I think it fits the style of play differently. This game is non-stop action - a mix of a shoot'em up and a fight'em up. So much fun. As a big fan of Max Payne, I have to say that the story of DTR is not close to Max's size, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want more of that "bullet-time" , you should definitely own this game.
