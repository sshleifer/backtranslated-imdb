An entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000 to set up a hovering crap game, and he's trying to get Sky Masterson to get the Savior-assisted redemption girl to travel to Havana with Masterson. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would be back in the missionary, in the fabled "Elmer Gantry". There she was sister Sharon and here she is sister Sarah. Same temper, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is the devilish Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habits. <br /> <br /> In a real change, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who actually sang himself here! <Br /> <br /> The film is saved by a choreography of superlatives. These dance and vocal routines are fabulous. They are especially realized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice production.
