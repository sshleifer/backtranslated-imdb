What's really sad is that shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the real reality TV, not the garbage that's nothing more than glorified gameshows. I think the bottom of dissatisfaction in recent years has been there with a very premature cancellation of numerous shows and a cult episode. With the rather vociferous feedback of fans from Jericho (which I like) and other shows, networks may reverse this trend. I'm like others, I will NOT support new shows until they get a second season. I will then possibly make a decision and catch up via DVD and online view. Until then you have lost me as a spectator at EVERY new show.
