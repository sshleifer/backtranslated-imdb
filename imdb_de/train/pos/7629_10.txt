Kurt Russell is Elvis, plain and simple. His commitment to this role led to what I think is the best movie ever. If you're an Elvis fan, check it out if you can. <br /> <br /> The TV movie was shot two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> One piece of advice comes in two versions - one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. The only one you have to see is the longer one. For the shorter one, more than one hour of material has been cut out. It just does not work because the scenes often depend on the scenes that were cut. This masterpiece takes you from the childhood of Elvis through his emergence as the greatest entertainment star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are great parents to Elvis. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
