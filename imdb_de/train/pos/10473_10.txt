I was in a bad mood when I saw this movie for the first time. For some reason, it worked on all my levels, family tensions, loneliness and the desire of someone to share your life with. It did not hurt that the person you can share your life with was a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack for this movie (very hard to get). Loved it and hope it will come out on DV one day
