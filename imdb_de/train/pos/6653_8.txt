Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, My Father" are a good film that cleverly examines the bewildered family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the battle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with society, his, his larger-than-life father, and especially demons in his mind. Parallels with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and fighting with every father every son could have. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - add color and pathos to this heartrending story of Harilal, who cried only once and runs away at the slightest touch of finger Feroz Khan's direction and production screen is lush and attractive, the script, however, could have been narrower. I saw it a couple of years ago on a pirated video DVD (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think), and it was definitely more enthralling. However, the background music of the film and the moments of the father, the son and the mother and the son are just a genial delight. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. That's borderline. It has the potential to have been so great that it was just differences in history between a father and son or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere the plot is lost and if you expect an absolute epitome of emotion, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It's decent to compare to other Gandhis. Certainly not a review like Kingsley's Gandhi or abstract as Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. The film is about to gain a foothold; one wonders however, "what if ..." is worth a clock. 7.5 / 10
