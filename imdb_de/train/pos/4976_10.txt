A film by Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> It is the responsibility of the hard-working HEMO THE Magnificent to pump blood through our veins. <br /> <br /> AT & T and Bell Science in the mid-fifties Together with the famous Hollywood director Frank Capra, he produced a series of CBS television films to educate the public about the universe around them. Far from the dreary black and white food often denied to young scientists. The Capra films taught and conversed with vivid fonts and eye-catching images shown in Technicolor. The four films - OUR LORD. Sun (1956), the strange case of the COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958), quickly became the schoolhouse's favorite, where they were shown endless in 16mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a sympathetic English professor at the University of Southern California. This avuncular educator proved to be the perfect film teacher, teaching his audience the sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them seem boring or boring.
