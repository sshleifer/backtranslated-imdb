I've always enjoyed seeing "Sabrina, the teenage witch" on ABC's TGIF Friday night. I think that was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday just to see this show and we never missed a episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and so funny. I also liked Sabrina's friend Harvey. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Teenage Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
