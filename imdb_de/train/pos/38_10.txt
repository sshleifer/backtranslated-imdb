One of the best Three Stooges shorts ever. A scary house full of wicked boys and "The Goon" challenges the best men in the Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is in great shape in the famous in-the-dark scene. Emil Sitka offers excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich as a target of murder. Before it is over, Shemp's "trusting little shovel" is used with great effect. This 16-minute gem moves about as fast as the Stooges Short and is twice as fast. Highly recommended.
