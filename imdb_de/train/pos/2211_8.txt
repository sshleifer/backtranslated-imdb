I do not watch a lot of TV except The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! S soup. I think I keep this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the crushing review of pop culture that gives this show. Soup also helps me keep up to date with what people in the office refer to when talking about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup Clips shows the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (come on, most people hang out on American Idol because of the crazy show that holds the castings which is why most people claim to watch. And that means I do not have to suffer from the other 98% of these insane talk shows or reality shows, for a nugget of "funny" or "shock". The only reason why Soup does not get 10 in my opinion is sometimes that the sketches are not so funny and on even rarer occasions the comment is not always up to date. But they may not be all home races, if so, Soup would not be on E !! <br /> <br /> Joel's quick joke and Soup's writing team (which includes McHale) make for a great show. I enjoy the laughter and the comments of the crew who are not in the camera. Even if they are obvious by occasional polite laughter, it is funny because it is compelling. They are obviously ironic. And that makes the show funny.
