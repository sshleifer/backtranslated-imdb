Although I really did not feel anything for Lance's character and thought his wife could have done much better with each other. There could have been a much stronger movie if they spent more time developing their characters, maybe with Lance. I would have liked it better. <br /> <br /> However, I must totally agree with DoyleLuver when they said, "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben," I'm the star here, that's right, I'm the talented one! "If you look at the movie, just look at it, even if it's in the background ... just its facial expressions, all in the eye, you know for sure what motivates Ben, how he feels about comments, too if it's a quick look behind the back of a character. Great act in a fair movie.
