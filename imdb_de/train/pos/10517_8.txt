Elaborate production values ​​and solid performances in this uncomplicated adaptation of the satirical classic by Jane Austen about marriage within and between classes in 18th-century provincial England. Northam and Paltrow are a satisfying mix as friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good mood is a sustainable virtue that substantially explains the accessibility of the aged source material (which has been somewhat mitigated in its hard skepticism). I liked the look of the film and the setting of the recordings, and I thought he would not rely so much on the sequence of head shots as most other movies of the 80's and 90's. Very good results
