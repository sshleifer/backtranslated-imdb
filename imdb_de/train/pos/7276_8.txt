When I rented this movie, I thought I would watch a horror movie. However, in this typical mystery drama of the seventies, directed by James T. Flocker, there is little horror. The handsome Matt Boston wears the picture with his outstanding performance and the typically strange atmosphere in Flocker's films is omnipresent.
