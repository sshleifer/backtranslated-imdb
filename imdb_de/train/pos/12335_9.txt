Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny conspiracy and in many cases terrible action. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivys husband, are very wooden. Ney is in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with every hair. Nevertheless, the film is so juicy and exciting. Loyalty to the book as most films of its time. Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress who was just as shocking at the time - I'm kidding, kids) - was a masterful stroke. She is just her ordinary Joan Fontainey-self. As befits murderers, she dies by dropping her feet through the floor into an empty room.
