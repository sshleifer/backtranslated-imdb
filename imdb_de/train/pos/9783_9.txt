As you might say, Peaches's "puzzling" story, with its complex narrative dealing with a variety of topics, is a mystery to me. I also think of many films that have a "little TV idea" in their actions. Her obvious aversion to the television industry ("Sue Smith has not gotten over her television background") is confusing. especially since you have such a "great time" working on television. If only we could all be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - AFI - Award Winning Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. All made for TV. Come to think about what's with the other "little TV ideas" like "Against the Wind," "Bodyline," "The Sacking," "Libra of Justice," "Blue Murder," "Water Under the Bridge." "etc. I think Peaches is a good entertaining movie that interested me and most of my friends from start to finish. It's far from flawless, but I think it's one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years. Who knows, with a few more visits (there's so much to think about), there could only be classics like "The Year My Voice Broke" or "The Devil's Playground". I really enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these films had their moments surreal, atmospheric, realistic, and dealt with important contemporary themes, but as for the conversation for women and women average moviegoers and me, it was very ordinary, if not boring. When I go to a movie, I am always aware of the audience's reaction to a movie (through reactions in the cinema and overheard conversations in the foyer and in the loo). Some came from Peaches and shook their heads, others with negative reviews, but many seemed to enjoy the experience.
