I last saw this streak for the third or fourth time on ENCW. I liked it so much that I ordered the DVD. This is truly a standout and of course the first of the Mann-Stewart pairings. More here than the usual idler, though not quite as strong as The Searchers. Many obvious symbolism for the achievement of masculinity, but mainly the spectacle of Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and the Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting because a handsome hero would be a hero interested in Lola, but too yellow. Just as Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically forced to put on an apron and serve coffee to his enemies. Decaf no doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson, who behaves like no Indian I've seen on screen, has interesting cameos. Special performances by John McIntire as too happy a card dealer / arms dealer who is staying at a party western version of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. flips a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some nice scenes with Stewart before coming to Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief, who take down Walter Brennan's teeth in Red River, are pleasant sightings. This is the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne or Scott could have gone through. Worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
