This is a fun movie. You may feel uncomfortable, because it is not some undead psychopath or sociopath, but your daily doctor. how scary is that? has gotten some good actors and actresses in this film, though some of Virginya Keehne as Sarah were not appreciated. Ken Foree, whom you may know about Rob Zombie's devils, refuses, and Halloween (2007) is our detective on the path of schizoid dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). Short summary is the following: Alan Feinstone, a man who has a sexy wife, a beautiful house and a great dentist whom everyone loves. Until he gets caught, as his wife cheats him with the pool cleaner. Then he gets hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotten and that the patients are his wife when he goes crazy in this thriller. But before that, nice guy.
