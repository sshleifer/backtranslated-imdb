I saw this series when it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two men met and told a director from every country that he was shooting a movie about 911. These directors have never met before the project was completed and they saw what it looked like. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All pieces were very powerful and some were controversial. If you are American, you may not like this, as some of the pieces may be anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who have enjoyed this series. The piece I found the best was from India. It was about how a Muslim family living in the States had two sons and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was in contact with the terrorist bomb attack. It captures the despair and humiliation of these allegations so well that tears came to my eyes. In the end, we see that her son had died trying to save the many victims from the fall of the towers. This was a true story, and that made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humorous and yet as powerful as the others. A must for all, and hopefully America will ban this and let it play in their country.
