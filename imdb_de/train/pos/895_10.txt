I saw this movie. This film is the best one to meet today's needs. Dowry in marriages is the main problem these days. In determining this problem, this film is the best. In this film, the Indian values ​​are given very well. Today's youth needs to understand this problem. There are fewer girls. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem persists, the day when there is no girl is not far away. So remember that today's youth need to understand that we can not take dowry in marriage. Dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem, we can see the new trend in society. This is the biggest change in society.
