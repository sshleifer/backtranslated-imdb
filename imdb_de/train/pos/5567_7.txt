And I'll tell you why: Who decided to edit this film to make it suitable for television, was very bad advice. Everything that has to do with medication is cut off and covered !!! How do you do that, could you ask? Well, they are not doing very well, that's for sure. Instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong should have in their possession, they should have diamonds! Nevertheless, the characters walk around in a haze of marijuana smoke and stony others on their way without any explanation!
