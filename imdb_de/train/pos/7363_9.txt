This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My only word summary of this film would be 'Excellent'. <br /> <br /> It will probably not like the mass movie watching. It's a <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to participate. They observe, think and question. <br /> <br /> Comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> maybe with The Blair Witch Project for the entire film style. <Br /> <br /> However, this movie is unique against both. <br /> <br /> The cinematography effects (solarization, freeze, blur, etc.) have been seen before, but they are most commonly used effectively in this <br /> <br / > film to underpin the natural tension of history. <br /> <br /> Trading is crude, threatening and absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the movie is about friendship; The title really gives the game away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have or want to experience. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
