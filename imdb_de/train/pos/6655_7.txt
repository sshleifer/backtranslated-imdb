It's one of the better Indian movies I've seen lately, instead of crappy vocal and dance or slum-dog movies. All actors have shown the right emotions with the right intensity and timing. It's the hallmark of a good movie to get viewers to research the subject, which is exactly what I've reviewed on Harilal. I like Akshay Khanna's subtle acting style over and over again, and interestingly, he had a rather complicated relationship with his own father, Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatically as Gandhis, and wonder how it helped him to pick up this character. I was impressed with the direction and 2 thumbs up for Anil Kapoor to produce such a classic movie.
