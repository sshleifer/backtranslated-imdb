Like almost everyone else who commented on this movie, I'm just wondering why this movie has never been shown on video. <br /> <br /> I remember when I saw him at the age of 12 in "The Late Show" (1972). I also remember the poison gas attack and the strangely dressed horses. (I can not remember the more horrible pieces I've described here, they were probably meant for the television audience.) But the scenes I really liked were those that involved the death of Lord Kitchener aboard HMS Hampshire , almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes in which the damned cruiser approached the minefield in a storm were truly daunting, if I remember. <br /> <br /> Do not remember the music, but the comments of others have made me curious now. Get this video!
