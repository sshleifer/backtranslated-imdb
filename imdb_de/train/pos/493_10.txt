I'm a Star Trek fan as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Enterprise was worth it. It was well done with the perfect backdrop and a great spectacle done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect ship to show the beginnings of what many people love. Scott Bakula was simply superior as captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave an outstanding performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That there are only two people in this wonderful new crew who will boldly introduce us to the great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> Enterprise looks like it's going to be a good show worth seeing, and I recommend that. Look at it.
