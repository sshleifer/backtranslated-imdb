I had heard good things about this movie. I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a more childlike character, similar to his other films. There were a few laughs here and there - nothing too funny. Probably my favorite part of the movie is dancing in the club scene. I have to try it out when I find myself in a club. Here and there a few stars, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the chick of X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a theatrical performance by Thandie Newton in one scene. She was, of course, in a previous movie starring Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I think it's a litter, you'll either enjoy it a bit or find it a bit boring. I can add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
