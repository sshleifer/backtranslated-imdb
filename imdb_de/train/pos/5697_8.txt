In May 2004, Wonderland is relatively new in the UK. Brilliant movie of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you'll see how well it's captured. The use of the elements that make up his robust cinematic style is original, heightens the experience and brings the viewer very close to the presence. Using a disjointed timeline in the "Pulp Fiction" style allows one to investigate the uncertainty about what really happened while attracting attention to the direction and performance of the cast, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for me, if I distribute it.
