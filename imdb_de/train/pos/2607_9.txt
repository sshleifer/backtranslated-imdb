The season finale sent mix messages, I felt feelings of joy and also the feeling of being lied to and betrayed. Roseanne tells all viewers that the entire ninth season was a lie because her husband Dan had died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery, and which season 9 was a lie, just as she wanted or wanted. I'm still confused when she says Becky ended up with David and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I think she wanted it that way, but it was not like that. So the season finale was good, but mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
