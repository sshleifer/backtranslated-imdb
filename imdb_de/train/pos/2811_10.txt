Silverlake Life, the view from here, is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS as well as a gay love relationship. In fact, some pictures are really hard to take, especially if you're gay or afraid of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who looks at it. It is not easy to make a movie about such a terrible disease and its consequences into a life, not just one, but two people. This film shows how to deal with each other in such difficult times, but it never gets too morbid, it still shows life and reminds you that life goes on outside the theater or your room, whatever the fate of some People can be. The characters are unbelievably endearing, as we watch their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit and never reveal anything private or offensive. Kids should not see this movie, but adults, whether or not they need to deal with such situations, should and will not regret the tears they shed.
