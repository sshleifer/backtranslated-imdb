A child with ideals, trying to change things around. A boy who is forced by the system to become a man. A system that hides the truth and violates the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, gets up and tells the truth. A family that falls apart and fights against it. A movie that you can not hide from. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things that you hope to have until the day you die, that it has never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things that allow nothing, a child with power and a child that feels like one Profi behaves as if he had never done anything else, he cared for this movie to the end and who wants to see how abuse found its place in the 60s.
