I saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where it was played under Midnight Madness. To tell the truth, the only reason I chose this movie was because he shared his name with the Radiohead song and because my friend bought the tickets, so I really had no choice: it was something like the silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be a half-blood snuff. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are sympathetic, and that's absolutely right. I'd really care less if Potent's character blew her guts off the creep. I was looking for homeless people to bring it to life, because Potente's character only got them as a dessert. Christopher Smith certainly did a good job with the visual aspect of the film. The story, though, is rather weak, but the whole point of the movie was to shit you off, and that did that pretty effectively. The score of a Bristol band called The Insects was first-rate. That especially scared the crap out of me. <br /> <br /> The director was a very decent guy and was quite entertaining during the Q & A session. I really hope he can make better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This is for genre fans only, but I would recommend non-fans to try this anyway. It was a fun ride.
