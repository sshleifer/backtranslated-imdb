"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I own this movie on DVD! The film is about a New York widow (Cher), who falls in love with the angry brother of her husband (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage), who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won an Oscar for this film. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great too. The direction of Norman Jewison (the "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie that everyone can see and laugh. A must! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
