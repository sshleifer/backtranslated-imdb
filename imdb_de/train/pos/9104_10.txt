Well, I did not agree with the other comment. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or any of the other films mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially about not real characters. I think someone wrote that just because he has never lived in Spanish society (and I'm not Spanish) is a very real movie with real characters done very well by the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> about a European movie unlike an American movie, we different companies, personally I do not like American modern movies (I like the classics and some of Andy's American films, but there are very few) , <br /> <br /> Is a film about the ongoing condition of one person, whether we like it or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn about the mistakes.
