David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California, but can not afford to share with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save money. The idea is on the way to where several serial killers did their thing, because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who just goes along with everything he says: I'm not interested in Pitt, but he does psycho-roles justice. The scary thing is that he makes them as good as he did before, no, no killers, but with pretty much the same attitude. Anyway, Carrie thinks the others have no money, but Earley always seems to be getting the money somehow. It does not matter that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it. Lewis does her part, we you are a not too bright woman who has a good heart, but does not understand that she can not bear being beaten up by Earley if she does something she does not like. As things get more and more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be dropped off at a gas station. Unfortunately, at the point she's inside, she's watching a news program detailing who they were traveling with. Then it goes downhill for them in a fast-paced clip. This is not the best streak in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what the "unrated" version should be, but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because it's me seemed pretty tame. Really ... not that this is family dinner or anything, unless it's the Manson Family. 7 out of 10.
