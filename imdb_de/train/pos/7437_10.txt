Recently, a friend and I discussed educational and ethical influences when we grew up in the 1950s compared to today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner in 1798. We had both asked to recite parts of the epic in high school and in English-language courses at college. My friend said, "His messages could even be called metaphysical in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and just remembered pieces. (I'm having trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd get two poems for everyone to read. That was easy enough, but I was very surprised that it turned into a movie. We looked forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, the hoarfrost of the ancient sailor is not easy to read. After everyone read the poem, we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> We saw the film as a remarkable achievement, especially given the fact that it was made in front of computers in the 70s before the so-called "Ken Burns Effect" came into existence and before special effects began too often To highlight a lack of substance, especially the illustrations from the 19th and 20th century, which are from "lesser-known artists" like Willy Pogany, the early Hollywood designer, <br /> <br /> The film is told by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was still a schoolmaster, and adds a tone of authority and credibility to the author to remain faithful to the poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery is in the layers of subtle messages that are conveyed without "instructing" or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality story, we found it a refreshing change from today's "in your face" d "Bullying over your head". Most of today's moral news in the film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos characterize evil. The bad ones are really, really bad, and good ones are superheroes. It is as if the human character lacks any nuance. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of appreciation for the celebration of all the wealth that life has to offer in the wider context of humanity, d. H. The ability of man to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of ourselves for having found this "unknown" gem, we learned that five out of six times it had received the highest award in its category at its "prestigious" international film festivals. Another surprise was that the director of the film, Raul daSilva, has learned. He is a recognized authority on early animation and has authored six award-winning books on film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is just as relevant today, if not more, than when Coleridge wrote the original epic and Raul daSilva translated it into the movie. If I was still teaching high school, which I had done for five years, I would buy this here and show it to all my students. There is a measure of wealth here that naturally leads to discussions about the great and important issues we all face, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - indeed, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
