Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me because it is a masterpiece of comedy. Billy Zane is stunning as a central character, and everyone manages to play the comedy as straightforward and natural as possible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good and the standards are a real treat. I recommend you try this movie with a few friends and a few bottles of your choice and prepare to be amazed and entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is carried so perfectly by kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From outer space it's in the true "B" movie tradition. But what does it matter more than that is the caliber of the people who participated in the film. Ron Pearlman, for example. I'm still barking at the scene where Zane rushes down a flight of stairs in an almost balletic style for no apparent reason. Everything is a bit crazy and so much the better.
