I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, stupid and entertaining. Had a good cast and was really hammered by some critics for reasons I really do not understand. No, it was not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a fun movie. The story is a bit stupid, but that's not a big drama, folks. I happened to see a review of the movie, probably the only good one he got, and then found it one night looking for a movie. I never heard it stink until I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Finally, I bought the VHS tape on the bargain pile and I look at it a couple of times a year.
