Running did not bother me. At that time, people had really gone for a walk. It gives this historical piece a touch of authenticity and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I too was disappointed with the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I see as one of the most exciting in the book. But I can not praise this movie enough because it stays true to Wells story! It's time. The actors are personable and the performances are charming. Also, this movie is worth watching just to hear the really great music of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see that the same actor played both the writer and his brother in London.
