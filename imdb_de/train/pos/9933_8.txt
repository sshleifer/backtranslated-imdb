If you need an escape, something that holds your attention for two hours and you can lose yourself in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. That's after all entertainment! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) that you want to see a second time to find out. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself, how her life became interesting for Hollywood. As for acting, many celebrity appearances are not shown in the trailers. And any actor who lets me forget who he is has done his job well. I did not even think about Kiera in a football uniform or a pirate costume. Granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs that he can care for other people.
