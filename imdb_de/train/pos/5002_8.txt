I had the privilege of seeing some snippets of Aardman's original run of this show in the UK. It was always funny and always funny. None of the charms was lost in the translation - it's as fresh as the respondents - whether part of it is in script form or not, as it was rumored, is irrelevant. It is always entertaining. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I probably value most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines, the fear discussing of needles, the painting monkey). Regulars also really grow up with you, like Maryland's horse and donkey youths, most couples (the parrots, the insects and the cats, just to name a few) and the child-like character, and I've really come to dig the ferret! Monday has finally become a day to look forward to.
