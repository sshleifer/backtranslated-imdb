I have a word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. The people in the theater sobbed. This film shows the hardships under which Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie. I was SO emotionally moved because he reminded us that we are very happy to be completely healthy. Some people in this world are less happy than we are. And sometimes we should give them a hunt and help them to the end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius a bite if they were not asked, they did not do it for the money they did for a friend in need. Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
