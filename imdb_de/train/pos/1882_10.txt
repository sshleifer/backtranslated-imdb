<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It's a return to the glittering, romantic comedies of the 1940s ... but with a modern touch. The script fills with wit, charm, humor and tenderness, the camera is breathtaking (NYC never looked so beautiful), and of course there's the cast! Dudley Moore shows his performance as a lovable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also wistful and real. One of the best lines of the film is its poignant expression "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a highly acclaimed Oscar for his great performance as Hobson, Arthard's Valet and Janitor. Although he took it for a "take the money and roll", he brings the character all the talent, the experience and the bravura of an expert Tragidian and a clever comedian. Nor is the side cast of this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's cheeky Granny Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso. <br /> <br /> The film music is also extremely catchy and complements the movie perfectly, causing ill-fated sequel.
