There's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist produces an almost undetectable toxic gas. Before he can reap the rewards for his discovery, the scientist is killed by a monk with a hood and a whip. After a coed was killed by gas in a church, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the murder continues. Who can stop this crazy killer, who seems to be able to come and go whenever he wants, into and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The killer. What's not to like about a killer sneaking around in a bright red KKK outfit with red gloves? The white whip he wears and uses stands out well from the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a murderer in a flaming red top costume sneaking around in a girl's school is quite far-fetched, it's one of the grimmer costumes I've ever seen. - Groovy 60s music. I really want to find the theme music from The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy, hip, '60s that I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. Behind the killer's red cloak and hood are a chimney, a pit of alligators with a cage, poison drapery, a strategically placed mannequin, miniskirts, go-go boots and miles of hair. I would describe it as a mix of the 60s Batman TV Show and an Italian Giallo. The college girl Murders is a true eye candy. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say there are more curves than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer was revealed, here comes one turn and another. And another one. And another one. <br /> <br /> What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be a comic relief, but his buffoon character has far too much screen time. <br /> <br /> - Why do alligators have? Earlier, I mentioned the alligators in the pit. And although they are a nice touch, they serve very little. Why go through all the trouble and not use it? <br /> <br /> - Plodding plot. Some of the college girl murders have no flow or rhythm. There are far too many moments throughout the film where things inexplicably come to a standstill. Better speed would have made this movie much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German thrillers, but of the few I've seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of ... London) that may be my favorite. This one has a real feeling of flair, into which I really immerse myself. If the conspiracy had gone a little better, I would easily have rated The College Girl Murders 7/10.
