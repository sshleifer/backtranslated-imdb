This movie was charming. An accountant wants more from life than the accepted conventional success. What makes it so good and so different from the standard dance movie is that it's really not about getting "great," it's just about finding a way to express yourself. The big triumph in the end is not winning a competition, not discovering a whole new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to do to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one discovers their passion, they find their calm soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes the subtle repression and "secret life" of the ballroom both understandable and personal. We can all see each other in everyone.
