I never attended the midnight show of a movie before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have the "T-shirt ticket" that I had to wear to get into the show somewhere. Like this shirt "Dick Tracy" stayed with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie, the sharp images, bright primary colors, and strong characters are undoubtedly engraved on your brain. It is a miracle to see. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-author / producer, Beatty knows what's in a movie and shows it here, taking a well-known American icon and re-creating it for a whole new era. Still in the thirties Tracy plays a timeless quality like all good movies. I've lost track of how many times I've seen "Tracy," and I catch something new each time. <br /> <br /> The others are all first-rate, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a Remember that he can make a comedy with the best), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney plays an important role in her can act in the right environment (CFSP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still issues that are addressed, such as the need for the family to remain true to oneself, good versus evil, and even Machiavellian issues are being investigated. Strange for a comic movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in itself. Compared to other films of this decade, there is a strong message. It's a good, strong movie that does not depend on blood, violence, obscenity or nudity. <br /> <br /> Here is a lesson to learn. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
