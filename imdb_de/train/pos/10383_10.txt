I saw this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but I never saw anything as fine and beautiful as this little TV movie. As far as I remember, it was part of a PBS series, and I've never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, only tender, moving, exceptionally touching moments of excitement and excitement, all set in a conservative environment of the First World War in which women played is the role of the dedicated wife who is waiting for her husband to return from the war and did not aspire to a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain has a great career as a photographer, and I've spent the next 30 years trying to find her in equally challenging roles, without success. <br /> <br /> There must be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD, but at least a video?
