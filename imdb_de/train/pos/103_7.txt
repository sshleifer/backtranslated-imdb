When I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First cast specifically Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough ... <br /> <br /> Film, very intelligent and interesting, because the actors have a lot of international, especially European actors and actresses like Turkey and Russsia ... <br /> <br /> Secondly The story is simple and you can guess, but if you do a good action, I think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the last chapter is not special or interesting, it's regular like other action movies. , <br /> <br /> Finally I recommend to watch this movie ... and I hope you will love it: D
