I really liked the movie when it was released, and I still do it because the story makes life in general and people hopeful ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's films , In addition to the positive mood from the movie, there are other reasons to like the Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a great cast ... like Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. In my opinion, Crash, the critically acclaimed film that received the Oscar for Best Picture, was very similar to this movie. The difference is that you feel positive about the Grand Canyon. Crash had the opposite effect on me; it was very dark. I would decide on Crash Canyon every day.
