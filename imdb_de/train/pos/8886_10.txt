I was not alive in the '60s, so I can not guarantee that this movie was an absolutely accurate representation of the time, but it's certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some great performances, most notably from Josh Hamilton (from With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play war-separated brothers. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor long ignored by many, gives a hearty performance as his stern father, forced to question his own beliefs and values, as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but empty returns inside, while the other is just the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and heartwarming movie that I hope will give everyone a chance.
