I can understand those who do not like this movie because they lack knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not geisha but tenants in the brothel, and one who does not know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end. This is a complete piece of art about the life and needs of women at this time. Everything is important, and the way they dress in the whole movie is more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I suggest that you read a little about this society before you draw a conclusion that is outside of reality. This is Kurosawa's life's work, and I am sure that the director understood the quiet meaning of Kurosawa's work in the right intellectual sphere.
