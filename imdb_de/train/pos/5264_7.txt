A delightful minifilm, a musical based on three Broadway smash songs by Cole Porter. Bob Hope's first film is a pleasure! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film begins by sitting at a table in a caf√© in front of the door telling his friends about this beauty that takes their breath away. Suddenly he sees her a few feet away. He is so over. His friends annoy him and suggest, "just show her your bank book." But Hope claims that he can win her in less than 30 days without money! They put polo ponies on the issue and take all the cash and IDs with them. Hope follows her, and when she alone makes a suggestion, she does not believe he is sincere until he sings her "Coin Porter": "You do something to me". But she has to go and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so that he can track her. But when she sees that he shows another girl in town, she wants to drop him. He continues to chase her and catch her and her family on a racetrack where, with his meager income at the last race, he hopes to win enough to impress them. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers, he loses the ticket and decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!
