Viggo Mortensen plays the lead role as the new inmate of a haunted prison, where the guard (played down by Lane Smith) has a gruesome secret that may explain why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the Living One who knows the secret and is worried about his life. When I think about prison films, I always think of action films with Stallone or Van Damme, or high-profile dramas like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I have not reckoned with a ghost story after Exorcist III. However, the prison is an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The movie is scary and has a good spectacle from a cast of (then) unknowns. Lane Smith is the best because his supervisor is not the usual clich√© of evil, but rather nervous and nervous, giving credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** (Good)
