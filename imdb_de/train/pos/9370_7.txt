I had never heard of this movie before I saw it. I wondered if it was an independent movie, and I was right, but with a good cast, I decided to give it a try. Basically, the drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and the bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh) gets a large sum of money, which he considers set for a batsman to be his infidel woman Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) to kill. He does not correct him, takes the money and goes to Suzanne, and after she has made him a counter offer, he decides that he must go. When Wayne knows his true identity, he pursues Michael with a big gun until he gets into a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the batsman he was wrong about, and he quickly retires. He goes back to Suzanne and knows that both are in danger, they are planning to leave the city together, and adds another complication by allowing them to collapse. However, before leaving, Suzanne insists that they steal a lot of money in the safe. Of course, things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle will catch up with them, and Lyle forces them and now binds Wayne to fetch the money he's spilled. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on a bandwagon together, but it's obvious they care more about the money and what they deserve. With Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, aside from a lame Boyle, are all good and dandy, and it has a pretty good movie feel for a black comedy thriller. Very well!
