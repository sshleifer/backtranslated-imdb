A warm, sweet, and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are romancing a mailbox without anybody knowing. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps away any syrupy sentimentality and encourages his actors to unobtrusive, unobtrusive performances. As a result, one falls in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong melancholic undercurrent in this movie that I really appreciated. Loneliness is a key theme most clearly represented in the character of the business owner and manager, who is wonderfully played by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is a cuckold of his wife, and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to make him feel lonely when he has no partner who can share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, as they both approach these unseen others whom each thinks of as a soulmate before he even meets. Of course, we know that in the end everything will be right, but the film does not make you forget the gloomy feeling one of them would feel if he thought the reality of the fantasy was not doing well with a crackerjack cast that has a wealth of chemistry. The small group of shop clerks call themselves a small family throughout the movie, and that's how it feels to us. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, unsung romance. <br /> <br /> Note: A +
