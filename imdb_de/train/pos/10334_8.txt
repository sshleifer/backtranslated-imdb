I have not seen this movie on TCM until recently and found this story about Poland and a small town that suffered Nazi occupation of cities, as well as many other European cities: Norway. The First World War was over and the people in this city were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded that the war always creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in the city. He was raised as a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they did not accept him completely. When Hitler's party came to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to punish this little Polish town for its treatment of him, which was all in his mind. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are depicted in this picture, with Jewish people going to the gas chambers of the Nazis. If you have not seen this movie and you like this theme, give it some time. This film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.
