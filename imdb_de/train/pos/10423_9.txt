Yes, my love was Mario Lanza's highlight and is still popular today. His voice was strong and calm, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant exercise and singing lessons became the visionary Caruso for Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did an excellent job, but the story is not quite right. blame Hollywood! I used to sing his songs years ago, and myself became pretty good until I lost my voice ten years ago due to emphysema / asthma. Achieving the high note of Be My Love is not easy. but nice!
