I saw this movie the first few seconds of the voice of T.R. took me on the trip - well, I did not like the big sticky thumbs in the beginning, but the absurd humor and prevailing looks of the two Sissy actors - I do not know who played them - but she was great and also uma !!! - <br /> <br /> the other two people who were in the cinema after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a test to watch a movie that I like with one of my friends - and we both enjoyed the most - funny laughter - sadness about the "realistic police normals". we both are fans of T.Robbin's books ... I thought it was well done - thought Robbins would agree, even though I have no idea if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br /> i would like to see the cut out stuff - i heard that gus v. sand had to take out many scenes because of the first-time viewers (or the producers ???), but it is still an artistic film. way too short ... but it is one of my favorites of all time - and I am aware that the majority of people do not like this kind of movie and assume that people who like this movie are what they are they think ... .... what a shame. hopefully the day will come when there will be a DVD with the full material - hoping to see more of Crispian, Keanu - expecting to see her baby and all <br /> <br />, though You have the chance to see it, Think twice, and enjoy it when you've made the decision to watch ... m
