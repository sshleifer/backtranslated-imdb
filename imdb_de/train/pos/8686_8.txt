The second official episode of the "Columbo" series ("Murder by the Book," later shot) first hit the airwaves. Robert Culp, who would fit in with Peter Detalk's detective in several future installments, is a stellar employee as he heads the head of a sophisticated private investigative agency that murders a client's wife as she refuses to embark on his blackmail plans. The two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise, one of the best in the series.
