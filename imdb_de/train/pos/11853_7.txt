Life Pod is one of the movies you are watching and trying not to analyze too hard. The drama is amateurish at best. The special effects are obviously a low budget, but not too bad. The plot is more in stock, but with an interesting twist. Computers run amok, but not exactly a computer, and running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Nevertheless, the film has its moments and is quite visible. For me at least part of the fascination of this film is the outstanding role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the best actress in the world, but as a playmate of the month, she's sweet enough. All in all, Life Pod is like other low-budget sci-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star Lines bit is cute, but totally inaccurate. The last stock of the White Star Lines Company was acquired by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the Titanic's sister), which was sold for scrap in 1960.
