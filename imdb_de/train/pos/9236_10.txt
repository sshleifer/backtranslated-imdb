Suppose people left the original, because it was about time that the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece, even with all the stars, storylines, and art. Lorne Greene was great because Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect, as Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny as Starbuck, but I dare not say, not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with the Pegasus and the greetings from Earth was good. John Calicos was great as Baltar, War of the Gods. The best thing was experimenting in Terra Heaven Can Wait, then you had the women of Battlestar, not to compare them to Tricia, who as number six is ​​exceedingly beautiful, but not comparable to Jane Seymour's beauty. Not to mention Loerrta Spang, because Cassiopea was awesome. She had the beauty that a rainbow would be ashamed. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine that John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
