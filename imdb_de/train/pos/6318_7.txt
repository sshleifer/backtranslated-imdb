I had tried to rent this multiple times, but was always with the girlfriend, who generally rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies, with the comment "Um ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood." for this movie. "So enter the" Almighty Solo Movie Night "! <br /> <br /> Still, I found Welcome To Collinwood to be a pretty enjoyable movie, and although pretty much forgotten, it has fun moments and some laugh loud moments, I was not familiar with the fact that it's a remake, and I usually watch movies that try to ignore this fact, and look at them for their own merit anyway. "George Clooney adds a humorous and short cameo as a safe cracker One that made me, for the most part, wondering two things ... 1. Would not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney made a strange 5-minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos look old and faded, and how easily are they washed away? The performers, all good actors, have done their job very well and one gets the impression that they had a good time working together, wa It's pretty important in a movie like this one. Needless to say, in this film, not everything goes as planned, both in terms of plot and humor, but it made me examine the peculiarities and consider the original. I consider it a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe grab some friends and a pizza. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> By the way, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear that the much-to-be-appreciated Paolo Conte has been used, and it led me to a buzzing segment of the score long after the credits were relaxed.
