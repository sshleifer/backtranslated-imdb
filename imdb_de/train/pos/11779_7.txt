After reading Diamonds book, I was a bit disappointed in the show, but all in all, it's pretty informative. Reading the other comments, it is reassuring to know that the "culture warriors" work hard and "attacks" on "Western Civilization" are seen under every carpet. For sure. Like many scientists, he sees his theory as the most important thing. He seems to use every opportunity in the series the expression "cannons, germs and steel". We get it after about the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simpler (in the series)? For sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing and condenses a very long, complicated story on "smallpox, swords and horses", which completes the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things have actually contributed (but not fully defined) why the Spaniard was successful against the established cultures. <br /> <br /> Does he speak in any way against Western civilization? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear All he says is that luck played a big part in determining which cultures are progressing faster. * Not * that luck is the only reason self esteem, then this series is not for you. However, if you are interested in all factors that influence the success or failure of societies, this series offers a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
