The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film by French director Clair Denis, is the liberation of the film. It follows his own mind over time, space and character. There may be an action, but what I understand, I have taken from the description on the Netflix DVD case. Honestly, it may be better to know nothing about the movie before looking at it, because then the viewer can set all expectations aside. The movie requires the viewer to think, but it also interferes with the fact that he or she will not gain complete understanding. The human heart is the puzzle of the movie. Each picture questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, that of the beholder and that of Louis. Louis' character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery that such a character requires. Honestly, anyone could have played Louis' character if he or she had a wandering, willing, and comfortable heart. But Subor is the one presented here; He becomes a film, his identity is inextricably linked to him. Many of the images in the film that linger in my mind revolve around his facial expressions, vocally but mostly physically. The intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the silence and abundance of movements, but more fluent than any literature in the form it rejects. "Surrealistic" is a term used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasirealistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists outside the possibilities of reality; The simple, omnipresent score confirms the connection between heartbeat and dim light in music. Watch the film to see the consequences of combining verse and grasping for freedom.
