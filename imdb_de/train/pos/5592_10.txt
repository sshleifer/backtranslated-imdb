Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full nudity in the front, but it is much more. In fact, this is one of the highlights of cinematic poetry, along with some of the most important works of 1930s art cinema in the same prestigious group as Under the Roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. It is almost silent and is based mainly on his miraculous images and also on his fantastic, symphonic score by Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, also of editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert in the use of motifs. Maybe not as subtle as it could be, and perhaps a bit overused, but the appearance of objects like insects, lights, and horses makes the story pretty. Fortunately, the small dialog boxes are unobtrusive. They do not shake as much as you can imagine. The last bit is odd, to say the least. Reminiscent of Russian Silents, we have a montage of workers. That makes little sense in the course of the story, but it's so wonderful that I refuse to overstate that mistake. Ecstasy is a film that needs urgent rediscovery. It is one of the best movies ever made.
