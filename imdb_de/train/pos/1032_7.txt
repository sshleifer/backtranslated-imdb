A news movie, but a pretty good one. Excellent cast from top to bottom. Interesting in this plot of Bette Davis is essentially a backstory! The extremely negative reviews (name throw at screenplay / dramatist, associate this somehow with extremely negative comments on "Angles in America", etc.), argue against it, that the film was to be preached about Germany during World War II. Gosh, for me that's just a bit too differentiated understanding of morality. <br /> <br /> Theatrical and filmmaking as well as acting styles vary with the times and of course 70 years later, this movie is not made this way. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but although Casablanca was made in the same year and both Nazis had it, Casablanca is first and foremost a love story. The love story in this movie takes second place - more of a thriller. Both have a good deal of cheesy accents and wonderful character actors. The kids are a bit boring and could have been worked on
