I've just seen Valentine and I have to say that it was the best Slasher movie I've seen in years. In contrast to the current trend of 90s horror movies, this movie is more about being scary than mocking oneself. For those who hated "Scream," there's not a single reference to "the horror rules" in this movie (though the old Slasher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect mix of horror of the '80s and' 90s. You get the style, the cinematography and the good drama of movies from the 90s and the crazy madness of an 80s movie. I guess the year 2001 will finally give the horror fan out the movies they crave. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out as a funny character. You can tell she liked her role and that's what makes her so special. I loved her in this movie.
