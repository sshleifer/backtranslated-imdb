This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in his cellar in a lasagna pan as he drives through the city trying to find a body by examining the native chicks. Finally, he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced head on it. The severed head befriends the failed experiment in the closet, and the conehead comes out of the closet and tears off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (his other has no right that a scientist had a previous mistake), and the whole place burns down. <br /> <br /> The film scared us so much as children that my boyfriend did not go to his basement for a year after he saw him. As children we have classified the scariest films of all time and this was number four. Only one of those scary movies was really good (the original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie seven reviews for the tremendous entertainment value it offers. Its scary effect of the crappy production and the strange sexual angle when the scientist searches for the bodies (complete with porn soundtrack) scares innocent children from hell, while the ridiculous aspects make him the main material for talking and laughing. I could watch and enjoy this movie tonight while I'd rather go to the dentist than see "Chicago" again. Seven is the best I can give him because his entertainment value is just luck. The movie is a catastrophe as a cinema.
