This is a great movie for bodybuilders and action fans! I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2, 3, 4) and proved to be a great fighter. She has a very distinctive appearance and an iron will to resist the mighty fog (Nemesis 2). Although this is not a movie of great value and the acting arts of Sue Price are not the best I have met in my life, the movie itself was something great, an invaluable gem for fans of bodybuilder women's fans! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied from other famous science-fiction movies like Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that in this film, A. Puyn has employed a very talented bodybuilder, who has brought all his energy and body talent to show us the best that she can. I really enjoyed the movie and with similar enthusiasm I saw Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity that it has not been shown on DVD yet :-(
