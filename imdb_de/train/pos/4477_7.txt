This one has a lot to offer - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of slags - Iturbi, Grayson - and a little ho hum - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real movie, in which the producer spent a dollar, and you could see him on the screen (previously he had appeared in two low-budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively), but if you just stood up The Sinatra whistles would have left Grayson's low spirits and Iturbi's Ego-Trip-Piano spots would have left us a much closer movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is, he scores in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We do not hate, I asked her - for his own solos, What makes the sunset, the charm of you and I fall in love too easily. Despite this step Lively, the best Sinatra musical of the forties remains at one tenth of the budget.
