If the Australian post office ever needed a recruiting commercial, that's it. This is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can watch over and over again. Miranda's performance is touching as she shows an aspect of Australia that is not presented by many Europeans, as it can be cold, wet and gloomy, just like anywhere else and just about anywhere else. The characters in the film are warm and inviting, making the prospect of a career jump into a dead letter office a thought. Miranda has made major films, but I hope she always has a thought for this film?
