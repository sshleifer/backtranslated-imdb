I'm a pretty big fan of most of the movies based on Stephen King's books - this movie is considered to be one of the scariest and most memorable times and I still find it heartbreaking and frightening. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is on a safe collision course with the monster truck is one that stands out. And the "no fair" that little Miko Hughes said at the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
