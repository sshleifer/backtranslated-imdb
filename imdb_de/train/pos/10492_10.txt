I saw Saving Grace right after the video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex, but does not take the conversation with it. It is full of weird moments and has a very lovely quality. The characters do the movie so well. They each have their own quirky qualities that contribute to humor. The two old ladies, played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law, come to mind. Great spectacle was made by everyone, especially Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were great at creating some of the funniest moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I can recommend this movie in any case!
