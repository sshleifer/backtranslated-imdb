The 14-year-old in me is immensely happy that they can now make really good-looking fantasy movies, and that they are all the rage when it comes to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia cash at the box office. There are (and we've already seen) several more this year, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared this week with little more than a look in theaters. I have not seen a preview, just a few commercials. The critical reaction is kinda blah. I would not have even seen it if I had not waited for the fact that I had to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing interesting was opening this weekend. If you forgive the terrible pun, the stars must be right, because I visited Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The storyline is your basic fantasy quest (the hero seeks a fallen star), full of obstacles. Within these features, the story is lively and imaginative. It should just be fun and a charming little romance. And it works wonderfully. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them was almost as funny as this one. There is a lot going on, but the story is well told and almost completely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it can definitely take the same kind of ground that has something like The Princess Bride (though I do not like it as much as the previous movie). Have fun here if you are a fan of the genre.
