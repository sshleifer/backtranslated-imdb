Overall, I liked this movie and would recommend it to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to note the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols' Closer. Especially in a scene in which Adrian Grenier's character questions Rosario Dawson's sex life during his absence, she is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer, in which Clive Owen's character questions Julia Roberts, though in "Love" with less Hardness and intensity is traded. Also note that "Anna" is both the name of Dawson and Roberts. Can not be a coincidence. Now, Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how this connection formed. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
