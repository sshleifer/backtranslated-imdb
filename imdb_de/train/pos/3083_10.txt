This earns a 12 out of 10 points. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode and that's real quality. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a few New Yorkers, plays around with the concept of the six levels of separation, and cleverly intertwines their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning, as is the lovely Caseman. The scenery is fantastic and the wardrobes are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more shows like these that make viewers feel intelligent, not mindless drones. <br /> <br /> If it never comes back, six degrees will be painfully missed.
