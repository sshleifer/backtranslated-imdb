This film is worth seeing for visual beauty and moving drama alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both in a supporting role as a transvestite opera star) are doomed to be banished to subordinate roles in China. This makes the unlikely bond between an old street artist and a young girl even stronger than a triumph over native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack, with the band swelling emotion through the performance of the actor superfluous. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer action movies.
