Another Norman Lear hit featured the problems that African Americans faced during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. With Esther Rolle and her husband, and three children living in a predominantly black environment in a Chicago skyscraper project. In the neighborhood, the show showed what black people went through with a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman), prices, and daily problems that existed. <br /> <br /> The 3 kids showed how people seem to face up to their problems - from the weird JJ to the militant Ralph Carter to their daughter who also strived for success - this show was a perfect depiction of African American life.
