Hello, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable story of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and unforgettable. Very good colorful movie. Another movie I later liked was High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
