This is the case where little Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie-type crime fiction writer who locks her nephew by marrying into a safe. Gordon believes he killed her niece and the young man dies of suffocation while Gordon travels to New York. However, he manages to leave a few hints, to scratch a few black safes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo steps into the case, suspecting it immediately and resolving the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is present as Gordon's secretary and aspiring blackmailer. I think Hartley is the granddaughter of psychologist B.F. Skinner. I'm not sure her ancestors had anything to do with her attractive navel during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner anyway. <br /> <br /> The murder is handled well. It's a good story, and none of the cast or crew flutters. But the outstanding figure is Ruth Gordon, who is only a meter over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost wavers, but she always radiates charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she is serious or when she attracts Columbo and the audience. She also gave some good lines. What humor is there from Gordon? Columbo has none of his frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice job for everyone involved.
