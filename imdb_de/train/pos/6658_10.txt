Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not get me wrong I do not judge the movie; It's such a wonderful movie and went out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual status, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could possibly break away from his loved ones. A man of such caliber leads his family and followers by example. According to the movie, he talked to his son and tried to understand where he was from, but poor harilall with so little reason could not understand his father. When something went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could stay calm and accept that his son is a big tragedy. <br /> <br /> If other parents had been, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the son get to his feet. Mahatma did not do that, he is a true leader who sets an example.
