I loved the story. Somewhere a poster said that there are no families like the one shown in this movie. Well, maybe it should be there. I thought everyone seemed really human and believable. What a first-class cast. What great music on the soundtrack. What a beautiful, and what a beautiful, but above all, I would like to say two words to recommend this movie. Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He has really shown a nice a subtle depth that has touched me. As a widower, who had devoted himself a little too much to the first good father, he really had the upper hand, at the expense of his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he behave like an irritated ass? Yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what made this movie so special. The actor who played this character made me believe that he was feeling something and not just acting as if he was feeling something, and he perfectly mediated what he felt and what he felt was rejected <br /> Denied happiness , <br /> <br /> Denied fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is painful and unbelievable I will never feel that again. <br /> <br /> Nice movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten points.
