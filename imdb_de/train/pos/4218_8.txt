I have not seen too many of the Columbo movies ... I think I only saw one or two, apart from this one. I've always liked Columbo, somehow, without having seen so much of him. Peter Falk is and was the perfect choice for the character because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) movie was filmed in 2003. That's 35 years. And Falk was 40 years old when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films (if I have not counted), all of which were created for television. Everyone knows the character, even if no one has ever seen a movie in the cinema. That's an achievement, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with it is that the killer and the murder are revealed at the very beginning (though this may be the same for all Columbo films). There is no secret left as Columbo solves it and makes it a bit boring (there is not much to look forward to at the end of the movie). The tempo is good, there is hardly a scene in which one is bored. The show is very good, especially that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great dialogues in the movie. The characters are well written and credible. The dialogue and the script are unusually good for a TV movie. All in all, the film is surprisingly good for a TV movie and definitely worth a visit for any fan of columbo and / or thriller / mystery movies. 8.10
