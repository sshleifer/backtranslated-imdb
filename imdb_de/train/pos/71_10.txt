I could not believe the comments about the movie. <br /> <br /> As I read the horrible opinions about the movie, I was wondering if you were actually watching the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was amazing! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had not enjoyed seeing one of the two actresses before, and I could not have been better off with the incredible work they had. Had I had to say that this is the most credible movie that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone with Deanna's drug choice has such a big suicide problem. After the comments it sounded as if it was the choice of actresses and their stupid decision. I do not understand, it's a movie written by someone else and directed by another director. So it may be the mistake of the actresses that I do not see. I think it was a really credible movie that I would see and recommend again. Opinions are what are and it is too bad that so many are so close. I hope that we will soon see one of the actors. I think they all played great roles. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will one day be the highest paid actress, and I hope she can laugh in the face of all the critics! You go girls!
