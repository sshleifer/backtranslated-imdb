The director Vincenzo Natali had a stylish approach with interesting camera angles and close-ups. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu gaining leading roles and expanding their spectrum as performers. This film also contained one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes of recent years. The efforts of the director and the actor combined into an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the movie's plot was complicated, the story came very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skull suspicion became known. > <br /> In 1949, George Orwell, in his famous 1984 novel, suggested that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state, which would control the mind and limit human freedom. It was interesting that in this fascinating futuristic film, not the state but the corporate world controlled and devalued the human worker.
