A trio of mates, sergeants, all in the British Army, are raging through Imperial India. They are very faithful to one another and face their greatest and deadliest challenge when they encounter the revival of a vile cult and its demeanor, the relentless guru. Now they must rely on the lowest servant of the regiment, water carrier GUNGA DIN, to rescue the dozens of Queen's soldiers from certain massacres. A wonderful adventure epic - a worthy start to Hollywood's Golden Year 1939. Filled with excitement and humor While the romantic interludes are kept to a minimum, it captivates the viewer's interest and holds it up to the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is virtually unsuccessful to talk about the performance nuances of the three stars Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are actually all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and in every way and purpose, indistinguishable. However, this does not diminish the great fun of just watching them have a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note that McLaglen boasted of an excellent military career during World War I. Fairbanks would have a sterling record during World War II - mostly in secret affairs and after the conflict not less than 4 honorary rites while Grant was reported to have been working under British Intelligence Intelligence and watching the Nazi sympathizers in Hollywood.) <br /> <br /> The real laurels should go to Sam Jaffe and be heartbreaking in the title role. He gives the modest man a radiant dignity and tremendous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem come true. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is a brave regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli, the Thuggee guru, is the evil Inkarnat. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote and Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Film lovers will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chooses its villains well. The demonic cult of Thuggee, worshiper of the hideous, blood-soaked potash, the Hindu Goddess of Destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritually ricocheting up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British military, in collaboration with a number of princely states, succeeded in finally suppressing religion. From now on, it would be the stuff for novels and nightmares.
