Fido is a story about better-behaved zombies trained to serve humanity. Everything falls apart as the young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family's neighbors. From then on there will be a catastrophe (well, maybe not a catastrophe, but to some degree chaos). Most people treat their zombies with fairness, and one of these characters sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, though not very disturbing). And we find the loving Fido, whatever he likes to do. This is a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It's probably also one of the least violent zombie movies (no negativity in that statement). I can only recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate that as 8/10. Rated R for violence related to zombie
