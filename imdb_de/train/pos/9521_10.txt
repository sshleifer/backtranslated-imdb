I think that this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons for this, but there are some of them 1) the good acting of Tom and Tyler 2) brilliant machine gun scene, which was a piece of brilliance 3) I thought the end was good twisting, because I never expected that Sam Mendes in the end all honor was. In addition to these 3 points, the film form of the film is good. I'm a college film student and we studied this movie in great detail. It was one of the best movies I have seen in many years. I would like to thank all the people who made this movie. Finally, let me say that the best scene in the movie is the machine gun scene where John Rooney is killed. It's just brilliance when the scene is shot in silence, until John Rooney says, "I'm glad it's you." So I think, because the viewer creates his own sound and this sound is just brilliant for every viewer. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk at the age of 16
