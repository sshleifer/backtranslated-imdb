I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, and I made an impressive impression. Here was a beautiful novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and acceptance in the dark ages of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and will. Her story, which Bronte told with Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. Not only did the mini-series strive to remain true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, called Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone in their roles. (The other performances by Rochester in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the passion, energy, and tenderness to accurately portray Rochester.) I assert that Timothy Dalton is at the top because he has all these qualities in his portrayal of Rochester Not only does Zelah Clarke look like Jane Eyre, but captures Janes calm, but firm and passionate nature perfectly: She holds her feelings like the Jane of the book at the right moments in the story, but lets her fire come in Jane's fire Passionate Scenes The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton represent in their scenes is also credible and faithful to the devoted relationship of Jane and Rochester.) The supporting actors also fit in perfectly with their roles and the sets are in keeping with the gothic character of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you have not read the book yet, you can view this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
