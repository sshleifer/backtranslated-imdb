I thought Ice Age is an awesome movie! As a woman of 30 years without children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, funny animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen in a long time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really humorous and I did not think his character could be found or even beaten) and even more so than Melman on Madagascar. I've seen the movie at least 15 times (I obviously own it) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says, "Oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny go on to find out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... Pack Wolves, Pack Bears, Pack Fleas, Pack Whiskers, Pack Noses, Pack a Derm Pack of Lies, Pack of Problems, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or so goes this part! This is THE funniest part of the entire movie, though I've really enjoyed the humor behind "sloths on the map" and many other areas as well. The only animated movie that can be compared to Ice Age remotely is Brother Bear.
