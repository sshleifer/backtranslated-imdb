If the thought of Arthur Askey puzzles you, do not worry, you can still see and love The Ghost Train like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy. It's a movie that's just too damn good to be submerged by a single performance, even that of the lead actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe because I go to his world instead of expecting him to come into my world, which is a mistake many people make. The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you can barely see it without wondering at the deep, dark world in which it transports you. It's as intriguing as few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers have done during the desperate early days of the '40s, and it's a movie that I'd imagine few people have ever seen. The cast is exceptionally good, maybe Linden Travers gets a bit on edge, but against the backdrop of a lonely wartime station, she could hardly play a fool and not stand out. The sad death of beautiful Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie, and now it's really in the past, but patiently waiting for us to press Play.
