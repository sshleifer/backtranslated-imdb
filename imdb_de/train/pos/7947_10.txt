I've seen this movie through my hood so many times that I can see all the dialogues again today. And if I look at it now, it just makes me happy and still surprisingly laughs. I find it amazing how they have managed to train animals, especially the cat, to play the lead role in a feature film. Unfortunately, looking at it now, I find that it is not the masterpiece that I thought was once. But I prefer to remember how I thought about it when I was younger when I saw it on VHS on my first TV and made it look yellow. And considering that it's a children's movie, I would definitely give it 10/10 anyway.
