This movie is wonderful in every way, which modern action adventures are not. Take time. Relax, enjoy. Think. People who find this film slow or flat or boring need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span catches up with the opportunity to connect with a cause or even a beautiful story in a beautiful location other than because there is no hurry to formulate the points that you so desperately need in the short amount of time. At first, I was afraid that Brosnan was playing a Native. Considering the story, I think it was the right casting. Now back to my Einsiedeln. -Jahfre
