The story is extremely unique. It's about these two pilots saving Earth from extraterrestrial beings, but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age quickly. The whole series is about the pilots involved in losing time, friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The end Might have been fantastic. It ended with an overall grade and left a real mark, but ended with a super happy Disney rating and annoyed me very badly. <br /> <br /> The animation is decent for 89 but can not be compared nowadays. I have also heard that many complain about the naivety of nudity. I actually found her a little decent. The nudity was mostly justified except in consequence 2 where there was a surplus. <br /> <br /> Overall, it deserves a look, but the end keeps it from being a classic.
