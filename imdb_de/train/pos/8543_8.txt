This was one of the films that I would probably never have taken off the shelf, but one day it came on the IFC and I said - Eric Pride, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> The topic is depressing - a young author who is paralyzed in the investigation of accident accidents in a lower-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to turn this into a manipulative fool. But that does not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood luck here. All the patients on the ward have a completely different background, but they feel helpless because they are at the mercy of others. Pride is very good as a "lonely wolf" guy, who has got into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt). Wesley Snipes is well suited as a former ladies' man whose family falls apart; But William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy who is determined to pay someone for his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
