I am amazed how this movie (and most of the others have an average of 5 stars and less, if there are modest films in the IMDb with 7 to 10 stars.) The mentality of the fanboy strikes again.When this movie came out, everyone struck him to ex-girlfriend questioned this movie questionably, years later I sat down to watch this movie, and I enjoyed laughing myself.This and The Replacement Killers were films in which the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael I do not understand how most of Fuqua's films are smarter than anything Michael Bay came up with ... Definitely ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former Convicted By a no-nonsense treasury agent Edgar (David Morse) used as a peasant to capture a killer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson) Alvin's every move is implanted by one into his jaw after an accident chased beetle. Bristol went awry after the golden bricks taken in a robbery. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is just as funny as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker who is much smarter than he suggests. Doug Hutchinson is doing well as Bristol. He can sometimes be over the top in his John Malkovitchesque behavior. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is well suited as a hard-nosed treasurer. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some fun moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The film's only flaw is that some of the thriller's attempts collapse. The scenario at the racecourse is far too exaggerated, but I could not look the other way. The director has given everything to get points. Also, the bombing scene with the treasurer tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty fancy. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bait is not a bad movie in the long run. It's never boring, it's always funny and I did not look at my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> PS: For the critic who claimed this movie was too violent ... How long have you lived under a rock? I'm pretty sure you saw the Die Hard series and ANY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But these movies are not violent, right? Weirdo
