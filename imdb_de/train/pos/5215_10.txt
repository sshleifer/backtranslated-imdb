All I can say is the first movie in this season that caught my attention. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising. I just looked at it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, but that makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things happen right now. And there are experts who try to change things and improve things, and laugh at their commitment to the cause. Actually, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that makes it better. Both Claire and Richard have played great roles and deserve a 10 of mine.
