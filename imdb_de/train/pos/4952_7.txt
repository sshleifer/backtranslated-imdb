Was shown for the second time at the Paramount 1 Theater on September 12, 2006 during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had its world premiere the day before at the Elgin Theater VISA Screening Room. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is that Morgan Freeman plays a once-in-a-lifetime, popular actor desperate for his career, who tackles roles that may lie beneath him, but he always does Still with a positive attitude, knowing that he has to pay the rent, etc. The descent is indicated by his long time between roles with previous bumps in DVD cases and his chauffeuring by a not-too-secure production assistant, the Freeman at a local Community market, where he researched for a role as a supermarket manager. He soon discovers that the real market is being led by a jealous "10 Items or Less" cashier played by Paz Vega. If Freeman's ride never comes back and Vega needs help preparing for an interview, the circumstances make them get together on a ride around the city to get Freeman home and give Vega a job that will take her to a more up-and-coming job Brings career path. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was fun, it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extensive musical sequences (one with Vega & Freeman teaching each other nursery rhymes, one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video) that would feel like timing up, and even then the movie was just for about 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that Morgan Freeman is as popular as he is, because without him, that would not have been enough. Sure it was partly funny and also Paz Vega is a joy, but it was just not enough to say that it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> You lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask directions and Paz Vega said she never does. Who has ever heard of a man who wanted to ask the way and the woman who says no? In the real world, it's just the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay in the credits for the payouts. That bit of a salesperson at the Target Store teaching Morgan Freeman how to speed sales is just funny! At an early stage, when Freeman's chauffeur insisted that it was Freeman's voice on a "books on tape" reading, that was also pretty funny. <br /> <br /> The director and writer Brad Silberling and the actress Paz Vega were present after the interview for a short Q & A screening. Silberling responded to a question that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and that Freeman, after assuming the role, actually changed little of what was there. A compliment to both Silberling's writing and how Freeman can easily get into a role and feel like he was born to play it.
