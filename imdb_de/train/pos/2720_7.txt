IN COLD BLOOD has to be considered a top-notch filmmaker, even though the theme is as grim as it gets in the world of ranting, but film noir fans should definitely consider this piece an exciting piece of work. It is based on a true crime frenzy. <br /> <br /> With Quincy Jones' music under the credits and dramatically dramatic views of a freeway bus heading towards Kansas City, it will effectively determine the mood of the movie even before it's finalized. Conrad Hall's black and white photography does a great job right from the start. <br /> <br /> Also clear from the beginning: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are born actors. They do a great job in representing free-spirited friends in search of the next thrill. Hell, there are two types of rules in the world, one for the rich and one for the poor, "says Wilson, taking a sip of alcohol behind the wheel. Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family, show no mercy and leave no witnesses behind. Blake, who remembers movies and thinks about the gold hunt in Mexico, he says: "Do you remember Bogart in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'?" (An ironic moment, because Blake was a small boy in the movie selling lottery tickets). "I detained you for a naturally-born murderer," Wilson tells Blake. JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the main investigators in this case and discovers that all four family members were handcuffed and shot in the head and his throat was cut. "Do not people close doors here?" asks PAUL STEWART. "You will be tonight," is the short answer. After the murders, the killers discover that there was "no thick safe vault in the wall," as their prison informer told them. In the end, it was really a stupid, pointless crime. The question is: WHY did they do it? And this is something that the second half of the film explores extensively. It takes one and a half hours for the investigators to catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation. <br /> <br /> It is these last scenes that have the most beliefs and the greatest interest, as the boys are told. I made many mistakes and left a living witness. The actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end. "It does not make sense," Blake says to Forsythe. "Mr. Cutter was a very nice gentleman, I thought until the time when I cut his throat." The script by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point - and so is his direction. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Brilliant portrayal of two aimless young men on a thriller that made no sense then or now only $ 43.
