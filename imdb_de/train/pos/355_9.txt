Like many horror fans, over the last 20 years I have been forcibly fed the same trivial Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher trips. Here is finally an original horror genre movie that ticked off all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool guns, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, lots of bucket load - you have it. <br /> <br /> With excellent fight choreographies and a supportive role for the Hammer Horror Scream Queen herself, Stephanie Beacham, this is really fantastic stuff. <br /> <br /> Despite its low budget, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger, using 35mm material and adding high-quality CG effects. <br /> <br /> A must for the horror movie of old school fans
