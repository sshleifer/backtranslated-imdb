Joan Fontaine plays the lead role in this Victorian movie. She convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover at her side, and also targets a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine has played her role to perfection - she was both cunning, calculating, innocent, scared and charming. To do that, an actress with extraordinary talent is needed. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely stunning in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. In the film is also Joan mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
