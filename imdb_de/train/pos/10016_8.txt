If there is something to recommend for this film, it is fascinating. The premise certainly attracts audiences because it's a mystery, and there's evidence throughout the movie that something dark is lurking. However, there is not much tension and Williams' meek portrayal does not help us connect with his obsession with the boy. Collete is much better than the woman whose true nature and intentions she has are not very clear. The production felt hectic and holes are obvious. It definitely feels like a preview of a much larger and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really good to have produced at least one commendable effort.
