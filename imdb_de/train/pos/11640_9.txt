What I liked most about this movie is that, like in Hitchcock's films, it's a thriller that does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock has understood that people go to the movies to have a good time. Something Hollywood seems to have forgotten in the last few years. This is a thriller, but there's a lot to laugh about and always wink at the camera. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is scarier than in Batman Begins. In earlier times, there were people who always played the bad guy. We do not see much of it these days because I suspect the Hollywood agents consider this a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The director is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialogue could have needed a lot of jumps. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really funny movie and people applauded when the credits started. If you're in the mood for an entertaining escapist thriller, "Red Eye" could be your ticket.
