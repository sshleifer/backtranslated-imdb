This movie should be better than an average action movie and was successful in this regard. This movie had a spectacular cinematography with spectacular mountain snow and highs, a very fitting Stallone that also performed well, an exciting action and a great performance from its main villain because it will really shock you with its evil ways. The film is not ranked because of the weak screenplay. The plot and the story scream for this film to make Stallone a special person, much like the characters of the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie. They decided to humanize Stallone's character in this film, which is alright, but given the style of action, the arousal factor weakens more realistically and less "talkative". Another weakness was the unrealistic shooting scenes. The filmmakers should have been more careful about how they had the shots and misses of the shots. They should have continued The quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the hijacking at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to water down a lot of shooting sequences (aka "A - Team" TV series) as soon as the bad guys set foot on mountain peaks. This movie had a lot of times ever. Crisper action sequences, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky emotions / determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level. I know it was not Stallone's fault. The director wanted to soften the character of Stallone and try to steal the film by directing himself for his directing, which was not great, if not for his cameraman.
