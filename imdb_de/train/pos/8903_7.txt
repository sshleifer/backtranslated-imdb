Sure, it's a 1950's special, but do not let that fool you. In my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected humor. Grab suspicious Mrs. Porter to keep an eye on the doctor's place. She not only steals the scene, but damn close to the whole movie. And where did these indie producers come from with the money to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob in black and white does not look good. Yes, the result is irregular at the edges, as the number of errors shows. Apart from a few teenagers, the non-Hollywood actor performs well. The juxtaposition of Hot Rodders and Cops is also lively and entertaining. Pretty good for a few directors who are more at home in a pulpit than on a soundstage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents." On the other hand, the 27-year-old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but still manages the hot rodder attitude. The film was a hit at that time, no doubt helped the catchy title tune, which got a lot of radio play. And aside from the unfortunate end effects, the movie is still fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I wait for the return of the blob as the polar icecap turns into fridge water.
