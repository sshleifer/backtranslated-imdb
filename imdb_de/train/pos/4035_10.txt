In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> At first, I was not very keen on watching Pinjar, because I thought this was another movie that complained about the partition and showed prejudices against India and Pakistan. I was totally wrong. Pinjar is a heartbreaking, emotional and intelligent movie with no visible flaws. I was persecuted after seeing it. It remained in my memory for so long; The themes, the pain, the loss, the feeling - everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece you rarely see in Bollywood these days. It has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the division a human history. Here no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, significant (thanks to Gulzar Sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and acting took my breath away. All were perfectly staffed. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an intellectual and really wonderful movie, look no further. This movie gives everything. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how good it is.
