I loved this movie! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan and I was always impressed with all of his work. From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. Among his witty roles like A League of Own Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor lighting the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an aspiring star who is promising as a Hanks-son Hollywood star and delivers nothing less than a great achievement. He is certainly someone to look out for during his career. I think he will do great things. As always, Paul Newman delivers a brilliant performance on the screen. He is really a legend. We can not forget the people who did not play such big roles in the film, but still helped make it great. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who performs in Bastard Out of Carolina, and the single White Female, which I will never forget, brings her grace to the film as Hank's wife and does an excellent job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the film. He does such a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets and Sweet November and I Dream of Africa, he does a great job.
