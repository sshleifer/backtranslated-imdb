I was completely involved in this film from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly recorded, with many interesting and original camera angles and techniques. The plot surrounds a deaf woman, who is taken up by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with the true intention of finding love. He's an ex-swindler and she uses him to avenge those who hurt her. In return, she has to help him with a robbery that requires her lip reading skills to accomplish that. The film goes into a dark movie Noir, with some really excellent scenes and an even better finale. The true beauty of this film is based on the way the director exploits the obstruction of the main character. The use of noise keeps tension constant, and the dramatic changes from silence to noise keep the blood moving. Add a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression and you've got the makings of a great movie. It's a kind of movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but it just can not.
