Ok, first of all, I have to point out that when I saw this strip for the first time, I was nine years old. If I had seen this for the first time two weeks ago, I would probably have noticed that this is just another cheap cable TV horror movie with some well-done scenes. But if you're nine, you're just not interested in these facts. That scared me then, especially the aforementioned Zelda scenes (and they still do). I'm somehow tied to this movie these days. I may have to see it once a month, and every New Year's Eve, I look at it with a pack of 12 beers and a lot of friends. It's like a starter for a good party! I agree with the people who said that acting here is pretty uninviting. While Midkiff and Crosby look like I want Louis and Rachel to look like that, you can not see much devotion or emotion on their faces. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes that undermine "The Creeds." What I actually want to say is that there's really no other movie that's similar to Pet Sematary, and I'm not talking about the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS INNOVATIVE AND UNIQUE. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a cable TV on a superficial level, but leaves you out there compared to the best horror chillers out there? Okay, I beat a few balls of the cast one minute ago, but I have to say that all the pieces in this level make the overall presentation perfect too. But tell me, if you really know a movie that resembles Pet Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the Night of the Living Dead here ... this is simply incomparable in terms of intelligence compared to this stuff.
