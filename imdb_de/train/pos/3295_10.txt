Such a beauty film that is hard to describe. Maybe it's the lack of superfluous dialogues, or maybe the absolutely outstanding soundtrack, or maybe just the feet of Meena Mumari, but it's a pleasure to see this movie again and again. I've never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it, and few out of any country can compete with its perfection.
