I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'm just going to spit out my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series first. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought that was great. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Richter, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis was apparently the fifth most important person in the cast. No big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of Season 7 and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) switched from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I do not know if it's because Hammond was more important than me or what, but for some reason the series became **** after the seventh season. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons were great. The movie Stargate looked mediocre at first glance, but it turned out to be a brilliant set-up of the show, even if it was not the original intention. I recommend watching the movie first, then watching the first season of the TV show, then watching the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation the second time, believe me) and then the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but that does not mean that they are not good. It just means that they are a flop if you have spoiled yourself in the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to check out the Stargate: Atlantis Off-Off series. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 07/18/08: I just heard that Don S. Davis had died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
