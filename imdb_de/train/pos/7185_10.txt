Ted Mapes, sitting on the porch of his home in Burbank, told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in each garment, except Hut. Ted, one of the biggest stunt men, said that every time Zorro put on his mask, he was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was a bit over the top: There were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but during the stunts we can be satisfied that Ted was at work. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is, as the comments here testify, one of the biggest series. It's exciting and in general very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor and, as someone else commented, he did a very good job. <br /> <br /> But admittedly it's the action that makes this movie so great. <br /> <br /> And what else can we expect, with guidance from this excellent team, Witney and English, with great music from the amazingly productive William Lava (the list here says he was not in the credits, but that is wrong, the other composers listed here were in fact not in the credits, and I do not know if they've ever written anything about the music (it sounds like lava) and with scoundrels from other people's great Charles King and with dozens of small parts? Also noteworthy was a rogue played by Radio Tarzan, Jim Pierce, son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini bio.) <br /> < br /> There's a chapter that slows things down depressingly, but, dammit, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and if you go over it Well, you're in excitement again. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big one Thank you for presenting this excellent series, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank everyone involved that we see it as a chapter play or as a series movie and not as an aftercut feature.
