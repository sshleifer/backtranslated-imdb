And that's a great rock'n'roll movie. No matter how it has evolved (it's a movie about disco), it ended up being one of the ultimate movies kids want to rock, but the client gets in their way. Remember the rock'n'roll movies of the 50s that save the day when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll music is really cool and safe for the kids is, and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweater for the dance. Forward to 1979, repeat the same plot, but take DA RAMONES, which nobody knew would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot "The Real" Don Steele )). Include all elements of a comedy film produced by Roger Corman, except for the two-day shoot. Some well-known Corman repertoire players like Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (there since "Bucket") Blood "), and you have one of the great Stoopid movies of the day, one of the few films that are deliberately cheesy and get away with it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember being seen driving through a stoner-induced fog, and he agreed that this is one of the greatest movies to see drunk, not least for the lovable leading ladies and the great Ramones material.
