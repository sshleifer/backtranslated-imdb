It was the first time I saw this on British television at the beginning of the 90s. I liked it then, but I missed the chance to record it. Many years passed, but the film always stayed with me and I lost hope to see it again, the main thing that was the end of me, the Lochburg part has really touched me, it's easy to see, has a great story , great music, the list goes on and on, it's OK, I say how good it is, but everyone will take it with them The best pieces with them, once they've seen it, yes, the animation is first class and beautiful, she shows her age in a few parts, but that has now become part of her beauty, I'm so glad it came out on DVD as it's one of my top 10 films of all time. Buy it or rent it, have a look. The best sightseeing is with drinks and food at night, so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it
