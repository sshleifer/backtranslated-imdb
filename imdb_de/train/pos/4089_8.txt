Strangely erotic gothic gothic horror loved by Hammer House of horror fans around the world. Seems to be an interesting attitude to "The Beauty and the Beast". It's definitely worth a look and surprisingly good considering the genre and the era. Corsets, castles, horses, wild fur monsters in the woods, the proof that no one had a Brazilian in their 70s and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick, what more can you want? <br /> <br /> It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon!
