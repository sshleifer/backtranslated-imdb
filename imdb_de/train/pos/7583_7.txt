The final chapter of the Hanzo the Razor Trilogy is the perfect ending to this entertaining series of samurai ploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) on the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, maybe it's because Shintaro Katsu is the producer, aside from the titular anti-hero. > Hanzo discovers a female spirit that preserves treasures that are at the bottom of the lake. Of course, since Hanzo is Hanzo, he's not deterred by the fact that she's a ghost, and he begins to rape ... um, she interrogates with the now-familiar rotatable power supply. The plot leads through a series of blind monks who serve as loan sharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives, and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior Onishi and his two servants supply the typical comedy notes and in general it is as usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which can be found everywhere) and a bit chaotic), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (probably the best in the Hanzo series) but still entertaining and rewarding for yourself. With customary training sequences, compulsory rape, sword fights and a mystery that Hanzo will examine, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.
