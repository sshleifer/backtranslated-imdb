At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubbornly he was looking for a bullet. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer of the tarot card of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is in the middle of a magic show of the mage Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra pulls Sid in with her investigation and looks for evidence that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and wonders if Joe Strombel is right. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen's comedy outside of Manhattan, actually back in London. His ironic and witty lines are just awesome and I've laughed a lot, including his fate of a hero in a country where people are "going the wrong way". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in great shape as a comedian. However, his current muse, Scarlett Johansson, of whom I am a big fan, seems overly and annoying at many moments, changing her accent into a histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely stupid and promiscuous and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a fun and rewarding conversation. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop O Grande Furo" ("Scoop The Big Scoop")
