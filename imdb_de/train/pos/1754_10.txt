This movie starts at the 15 second mark and continues throughout the movie. I can not remember a scene where I did not turn to people who laugh with me. He is the perfect actor for this role because he looks and dressed like that. <br /> <br /> The comedic parts were great to see by actors who were not very tall or popular. As you can see, people like this movie. This movie is currently rated at 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's put it this way: I have not seen this movie funny since the American cake or the original holiday. See it if you want a laugh. I give this movie two of the highest thumbs I have ever given since I learned about IMDb, a great movie site.
