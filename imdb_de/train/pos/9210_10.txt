I think that's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am an older man and love most westerns. I love movies that are based at least in part on facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is such a movie. I also like revenge-like movies. That qualifies there in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the flogging and the barn shooting scene. I felt like the Corral beat scene was a little over the top, but it did not affect how I felt the entire movie. I've seen what I believe is a sequel to this movie in a gun smoke episode. I liked that too. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I'll take a look at it again. I also found that the romantic parts of this movie were played well. I thought Randy Travis was so inappropriate to play a rogue guy, but I always like his acting.
