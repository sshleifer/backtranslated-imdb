I remember watching the end of the 70s on TV - and it stayed with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great children's movie. I recently put it on for some friends at a party - and of course they thought I was crazy, expecting the dolls to have something sick a la "Meet the Weak". But no - it's pure fun. <br /> <br /> jack wild is in good shape, as is Mama Cass and the somehow attractive Witch Poo. <br /> <br /> If you like the banana splits and are in your 30s, you will be reviving this surreal Saturday morning vibe! <br /> <br /> Even though I realized now that Puf himself is a bit crap - like everything he does, get trapped and run away! Quality TV movie - if you like Death Metal like me, you will love it!
