I loved "How the Grinch Christmas" when it was released, and I still love it, 5 years later. Still, many people seem to agree with me, and that movie never really got much love at the time it came out. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie is overkill and camping, but that's why that movie is so charming and fun. All sets, costumes, and characters are exaggerated in a playful way, without ever really getting ridiculous. It's a visually spectacular movie. It's a fight movie that does its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this funny little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun watching Jim Carrey as a Grinch. He really wears the movie with his good and funny role. Of course, the convincing make-up, which also received an Oscar, helps him. Of course, if you're a Jim Carrey hater, you should not think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes everything work. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as a young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good morale, but it's all a bit sad for me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we do not really celebrate as enthusiastically and big as in the US or England. For me, the movie was just funny and entertaining, and honestly, the moral left me pretty cold. <br /> <br /> The music of James Horner is good and fun, even though it's average Horner stuff everyday. It still works perfectly for the movie and helps to shape some of the work of the scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
