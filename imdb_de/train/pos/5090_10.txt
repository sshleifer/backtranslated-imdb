I loved this movie. Great plot and actors and good movie sets. It told the story in a way that I can easily understand and follow without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Apart from the fact that I could not find the soundtrack, I found the film fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think that's some of his best work. His last films were alright, but this really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best television movies ever aired. Congratulations to the producers and authors of this great work.
