From this the musical genre was made. Humor, talent, romance and action are united in one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else has to be said. Although Marlon Brando was not a singer, his performance of Sky Masterson did a great job of winning the hearts of many. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The ladies in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all viewers and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie you can see and enjoy!
