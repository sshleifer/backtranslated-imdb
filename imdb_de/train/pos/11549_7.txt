Nothing is really annoying about "The Odd Couple", and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a very successful comedic team. However, Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play is so underdeveloped that it looks more like a sketch in a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied movie. I have not seen the piece, but I have to assume that the screen version is pretty accurate since Simon wrote it, so the flaws are not due to a step-to-screen adjustment. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates because none of them know otherwise - that Simon never gets along completely. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
