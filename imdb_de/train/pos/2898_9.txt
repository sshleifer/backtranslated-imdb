What would happen if a depressed police officer works with a probationary probationary? Maybe it's a lot of fun ... This film sets a milestone in the action / comedy genre of Argentine cinema. Lovable characters, probable story and a tempo that has some thrill between laughter. I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertainment. At a time when it is difficult to trust someone, Peretti and Luque are fighting a cold and courageous opponent. This film will surprise you, the other side of the coin of Analyze Me, but not immediately, without envy. And if you want to get to know Bs.AS, there are only a few scenes of downtown and the city center.
