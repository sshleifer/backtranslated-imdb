Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin, and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow deliver world-class performance in their respective roles. Ms. Phillips has the less enviable job of trying to spice up a television movie (twenty-five years ago) by offering "sex-interest" in an otherwise sexless film. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; borrowed a Ford coupe from 1934, Jake "Jacobs", put in front of the camera and provided with a workout that leaves the audience gasping, panting and with breathless anticipation, the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> The action The scenes are spectacular (though some dialogues are a bit lame), which makes for a nice break in the evening. So all "car movies" should be done. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this in the late movie channel; it is worth the missed sleep.
