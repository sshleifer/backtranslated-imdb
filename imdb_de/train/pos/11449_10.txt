This was by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who is threatened with extinction. he regards the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that in a good sense it is primitive. His purity, honesty and kindness breathe clearly as you see him working in such simple yet lifelong works of art. I was astonished how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted his end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish humor covers his disappointments brilliantly. The film turns elegantly and contains the same flow as Goldsworthy's art. it combines nature and art to a minimum, as it is in itself. Fred Frith's music is organic enough to mix everything without interfering with the naturalistic sound. Overall, this is a great job in every way. There are no limits as far as age is concerned.
