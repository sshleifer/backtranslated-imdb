Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee. Li is distinguished as a discreet librarian / policeman who always saves everything. He has a presence and a look that is intriguing and believable as the Kung Fu King you do not care about. Francoise Yip is just beautiful in this mixed breed A fascination that I found memorable. The bad guy, the man with the sunglasses and the long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name in the credits. Can somebody help me with it? Many Thanks ! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask, great entertainment in any language!
