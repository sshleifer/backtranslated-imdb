Outstanding performance from Warner Bros with Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. It's often called its best and I can not really judge until I've seen its "Dawn Patrol". His work in "They Died With Their Boots", however, requires some punches. I'm a big Flynn fanatic (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps that he's an Aussie) and I think he's just great, a great on-screen presence and also a great actor. He is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with fancy footwork, but he is also backed by a readable, warm and witty script as well as Raoul Walsh's directing. Every Walsh movie I've seen never loses a beat of its tempo, he was really a born filmmaker. Walsh conducts the Ring scenes beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and the poignant grand final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to that great production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And a nice minor cast, and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's buddy, but here is his dad and everything still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. The couple is head over heels in love with each other in the fight.
