Wow, that was a movie that was absolutely captivating. I could not believe I woke up so late to watch the movie, but it was too late. I started to look. I could not stop Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other well-known actors and actresses - this was more than a glimpse of the story. It opened with a glimpse into another part of society that people do not know and may even be embarrassed to talk about. I've never heard of a book or movie about it before. This is something black history never goes into, it just looks down because they were privileged and mixed races. I highly recommend this movie
