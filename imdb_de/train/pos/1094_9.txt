This is one of the few comedies that I can see again and again and still laugh out loud. Elsewhere, I've read complaints about racism and sexism from peaceful, politically correct prigs. There are none here either, unless you define sexism as a wife as a housewife and racism as a family employing a motley maid. <br /> <br /> The lines are hilarious and all leads have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've ever thought or tried a new house, you'll be relieved to know no matter how annoying the process is, no matter how much a lamb is a wolves you can feel, you're not alone!
