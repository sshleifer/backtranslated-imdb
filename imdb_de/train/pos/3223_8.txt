Ok, basically it's a popcorn science fiction movie, but from the beginning it's obvious he was filmed with lots of intelligence. You can count about 10 clich√©s the film is built up to, but it only brings three of them, and a few of them have a twist that lets you know once again that the director did not think it was you an idiot. Kurt Russell's drama is really great and brings a surprising and rewarding depth. Recommended if you have just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
