I saw Martin's Day for the first time when I was just 10 years old, at the Movie Channel home, and still remember the impact on my life. It touched me when no other movie touched me and I remember removing my eyes. <br /> <br /> After seeing it for the first time, I could not find it anywhere else. I would ask and nobody had ever heard of the movie! I think it was one of those rarer movies that not many people knew, because nobody and I mean, nobody knew what I was talking about. I've searched and searched over the years, looked through the shelves of the video stores and scanned cable TV lists, but was always close. Finally, in 1996, I found out that I could order it specifically and have probably seen it at least 50 times since - and it keeps making me cry. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good person) who yearns to return to the particular lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place where he lived by nature, spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life. Soon he escapes into the movie and makes his way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the police to find him, and Steckert attacks a child hostage to force the police to return. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the second Martin) become best friends and have many fun joint adventures - from raiding a toy truck to lifting a train to this particular lake. <br /> <br Throughout the film, Steckert has great flashbacks on him as a boy on the lake. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin your end, but I'll tell you that this movie is a must. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I'm without doubt the biggest fan of this movie EVER! I found the song the two Martin's sing throughout the movie ("I'm going back where I'm from ...) and I even plan a trip to Canada to see the lake and the lodge where Martin's Day is was filmed, crazy, I know - but this movie just means so much to me.
