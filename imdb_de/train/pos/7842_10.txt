So I was so caught up in half of the school's season and activities that I did not know that the show was canceled halfway, which is crap. <br /> <br /> I think the supporters of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a season can later be released on DVD. Maybe then they will see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive their first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and was looking forward to it every Thursday after the OK. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to see the show, only to find that it has disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with Fox right now. even more so when it was discovered that NO ENDING was filmed. I mean, if you're working on a project, at least stop it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a semi-manufactured car, it's pretty useless. Fox, film the damn end and give some fans of the show some rest.
