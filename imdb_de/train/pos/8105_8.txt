SYNOPSIS The Future of England from 1939. Europe was in a state of war, and the salvation of humanity will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome the mistakes of humanity's past. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT RELATING TO THE VIEWER Beware of your guides and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter future. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. PROS AND CONS I had seen this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the internet (it is in public domain). This is a fascinating work on many levels. Since this is a story of the future from 1939, it has obvious shortcomings. This vision of the future is both frightening and bizarre. This movie was innovative for its day. The special effects are very good, as is the story. Acting suffers a bit in the British theater, as she can rely a little on Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the basic themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all of the problems we have now. Knowledge is not always true. The other plot of the movie is that charismatic leaders are a bane of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The basics of almost all later science fiction films are featured in this movie. The stage design and wardrobe of "Forbidden Planet", the technical flaws in "2001: A Space Odessy", even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of "Star Wars" have given this movie some inspiration. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer a little baffled. While optimistic in its final sequel to reaching for the stars, we must ask ourselves if humanity will ever succeed. Even as we reach each other, there are those who try to hold us back. This cinematic vision of the future is a bit humorous by today's standards. Huge flying machines and guns used to launch people into space were never realized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. Many great British actors perform as young men in this film. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the best known and their rhetoric is evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character Cabel. His character almost appears as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. This is a good piece of cinematic history, whose topics are still relevant today. Vision has missed the target.
