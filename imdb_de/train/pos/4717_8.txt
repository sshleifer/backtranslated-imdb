How can someone not love this movie? I think it's a funny parody of all the old gangster movies; If you have never seen them, look at this. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role, because everything goes. A guy mutilates the English language every time he speaks, and Griffin Dunn plays an unsuspecting D.A., but my favorite role must be Joe Piscopo. He has the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale and Ray Walston are in this star-studded movie that makes mobster gangsters much funnier than "mafia" for the criminal underground.
