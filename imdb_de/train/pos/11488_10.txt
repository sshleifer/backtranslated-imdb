I rented Zero Day at the local video store last week. I had never heard of the movie and had my concerns. As soon as I watched the box, I knew that the movie was an indie movie, so the quality would be less than a mainstream movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I started all over again after the Zero Day game. The film clearly followed the basics of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999. What impressed me, however, was the credibility of the two main characters. The first time I saw this movie, I was not sure I actually saw ribbons left behind by the shooters in Columbine. In the back of my mind, I knew that what I was looking at could not be real, but at the same time acting was so convincing that you had to constantly shake your head. <br /> <br /> Does the movie bother you? Absolute! Will you see things that make you question the merit of the film? Probably. I think what most people find disturbing is that they actually have feelings for the two main characters Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt a deep sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had compassion for her because her life had come to such a dreadful point. They had fallen so low through cracks that they had walked down a street that could have been stopped if only the people around them had noticed their plight. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal look at events that most of us will only ever see in the news. It makes you think about life. And it baffles you how people get to this point. One week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those who have not yet seen Zero Day should consider the following: The film is an independent film with little or no budget and the film will be recorded on a camcorder. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all that aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and maybe help you to open your eyes a bit.
