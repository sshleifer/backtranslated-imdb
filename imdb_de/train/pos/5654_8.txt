I saw the show 10 years ago and loved it !!! I now own the DVD and watched the show and waited for scenes that I knew were on the show (as Lucas confronted Gail in his house) and realized they were missing - suddenly I saw the seduction without guidance above. Then I went online to check all the stars' bios and came across the comments on the shows that were out of service. Thank you!!!!! However, there seems to be a conflict. In some comments it says "Strangler number 19, then Triangle 20, when another had them in the other direction." And also Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6 were also reversed. Can someone clarify something ?????
