In October 1945, the American-German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt post, and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) receives a job as a sleeping car conductor for him in the Zentropa railway line. While learning his train on the train, he sees the devastated occupied Germany and gets to know Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former big business entrepreneur and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the Allies and the Germans and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves", which kills the sympathizers of the Allies and subversive actions against the Allies. He falls in love with Katharina, and earlier she reveals that she was a "werewolf". If Max commits suicide, Leopold is also beset by the "werewolves" and must take a position and a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and embarrassing Kafkanian story by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. In an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and a magnificent black-and-white cinematography with some colorful details, this film shows a difficult time in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation faced after defeat in the war. Very impressive is the action of the occupation forces, which destroys resources that could enable a quicker reconstruction of a devastated country, and the corruption with the Jew Max was to identify. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing performance in the role of the man who wants to stay neutral but gets manipulated everywhere. The hypnotic narrative by Max Von Sydow is another class in this award-winning film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
