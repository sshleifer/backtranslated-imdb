Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. We're focusing on a group of Trail Drovers led by trail boss Gil Favor. Most of the episodes - especially from the first three seasons - were character studies of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a real western and Gil Favor was an unforgettable character that should never be forgotten. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, the show became a huge success. Of course he was supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan and Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark on a television story. Rawhide has captured the flair of that time of the West, which has not brought me any other series yet. Later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual storylines. Sometimes that did not work for me - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained the top drawer. The black-and-white photography added a dreary, realistic feeling that other western series could rarely capture. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheros, beautiful girls in need, serial killers, all appeared to cause problems for our heroes. The end of the series ended quietly, as the last season was less than half expired. The reason - Eric Fleming had left and Rawhide was now a headless body - the stark realism had vanished, Gil Favor commanded respect and beamed authority - he was never infallible and that made him all the more interesting. We will not see him again. Watch an episode whenever you can, they rarely disappoint.
