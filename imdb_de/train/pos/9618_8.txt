I recently bought this movie and I do not regret that I really like it. I liked to include this movie in my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month to film and spent about 1 million euros on the production of this great movie. This proves that not only big productions make great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this film fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG means program error that causes reactions in the computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The dizzying events in this film begin with the death of a BUG. One man bears witness to the "crime" across the street ... From then on everything gets complicated ... I point to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), the man Wallece, who can not do everything right.
