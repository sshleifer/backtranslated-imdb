I found 'Time At The Top' a fun and inspiring experience. The drama was not generally brilliant, but quite acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film apparently aimed at the younger population, this is certainly one of the better works of the genre (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally I would say that Canada, UK and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for kids, and "Time At The Top" does not mind this theory! I do not think that continuity and good action are important to younger people. A good plot and a resourceful script are much more important to you. Both are abundant in this film. The special effects are good, without affecting the story or excluding the viewer from their own ideas. It would have been very easy to inject an overload of SFX into this movie, but he would have completely destroyed his entire 'Raison D'etre'. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work in this film are of a very high standard and complement the classy wardrobe and historical accuracy. All in all, this movie is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world with children's eyes or those who try it, like myself! Now I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
