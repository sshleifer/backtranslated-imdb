Laputa: Castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates, how could it be even better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack that is reused many times thereafter (I am not sure if I have heard this for the first time) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of a soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie, is absolutely gorgeous and the boy, Pazu, is also a great role model - he lives alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not tell, but the end is really great. I rate this with Nausicaa and Spirited Away as one of the top three of Miyazaki. You might also want to watch Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (hopefully I hope so next year). If you like Miyazaki, check this out as it is available in the US. Have fun, Piper A
