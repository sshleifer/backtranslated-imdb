"And All Through the House" is a special crypt episode, not only because it's from season one, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember when HBO was on vacation with my parents in the summer of 1989 with my parents in our South Carolina hotel room. I saw this episode and was buried in the tomb. I have always been a fan of horror suspense series and I liked monster movies, and with this HBO-started series, I was scared again. This episode, the first one I've seen, is memorable for me and one of my favorites. She is just awesome with a nice twist. "And All Through the House" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve. This is the perfect way to relax while vacationing. Well, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who, incidentally, works in several Warner brothers, mostly in small parts) as a greedy, alien woman who takes care of her husband while waiting for some money and a new romance. Only as with most horror series, things change for the worst, and the bad people get what they deserve. Chances are huge when a maniac dressed as Santa man escapes from a nut house and decides on Christmas eve for a late holiday! As learned from the old E.C. comic lessons, bad people are learning what they are evil for! Well, this story ends with a perfect holiday cry! This story was also in the 1972 movie with Joan Collins, which is without doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time!
