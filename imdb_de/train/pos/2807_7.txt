I caught the last half of this movie on cable one evening and was surprised at how morbid it was. Even if one of the two victims has deteriorated the most, the camera keeps running. The permanent shots of his body being uncovered and his concentration camp figure being packed in a body bag are both moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you are already depressed. then do not look at it again when you are really well.
