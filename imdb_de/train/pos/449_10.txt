For anyone who judged others at the first meeting, here's the perfect depth-of-character tutorial. The grumpy old lady has a gentle, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The volatile, insecure, "ditsy" lady who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - looks deep into your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, ordinary, neglected wife has a passion that overcooks every minute - if the right attitude is given. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, party, persecuted by crowds - wants peace, tranquility and love without obsession. <br /> <br /> If you take the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life from the least anticipated sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
