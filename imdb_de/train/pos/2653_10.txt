Kubrick has once again proven his brilliance, now in a thrilling horror movie based on Stephen King's book bearing the same title. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with a child and a past of anger and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends operations due to the extreme weather during the winter, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during these five months. and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, thought it was perfect. However, the manager advised Torrance on winter loneliness, possibly dangerous, and told him that a janitor had gone mad earlier and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who shinning the future, knew the place was not good and did not want to leave. As soon as they got settled in the hotel, things really started, but within a month Jack began to behave strangely, confused and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but we do not know when and how. Creepy things happen, such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who violently attacked him. You are not alone in this place. Later, Jack visited other people and immediately felt good with them, as if they were his family. among them the famous psychotic janitor Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Following this order, Jack went for the goal and many of the scariest things I've ever seen here. The end is spectacular and the spectators remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
