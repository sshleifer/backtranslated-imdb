Although this series only ran one season, she has stayed with me for 20 years. It was by far and, above all, my favorite cartoon of all time. I would give almost everything to have it on DVD, or whatever format I can get. If you find any means to view this series, I suggest that you take full advantage of it. This series was (in my opinion) the first to have a truly coherent storyline that spanned several episodes. It also got me to really care about the characters and what happened to them. Heck, the character Goose really scared me sometimes. He was just so funny at the time. Also, the leader of the group reminds me very much of a combination of Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones. If someone can contact the creator / owner of the rights to the series and publish it on DVD, please do so anyway !!!
