Well, it's definitely unlike anything else that is led by Lynch. No supernatural stuff, no violence, no worldliness. Nevertheless, it is a nice strip. It's a bit slow, but maybe that was intentional because it's the story of an old man referring to a 6-week journey (that's my best guess for his duration). The characters are ordinary people and therefore believable. The performances are good and the last scene was incredibly touching. Anyone who has siblings can refer to it. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fights are forgotten.
