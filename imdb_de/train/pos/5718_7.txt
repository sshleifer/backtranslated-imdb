I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen so I first bought tickets and checked the ratings on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts that were supposed to be scary were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not think that's a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a pretty well made horror movie. It does not depend heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, spectacles and music. In my opinion, the spectacle was fine. Sarah did a very good job, very convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the same ones used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen a lot of horror and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some beautiful scenes that were almost original, like garbage marks, simple special effects for the ghosts, the boy's eyes, the cat making eerie noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his Mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go much harder if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode because she's so different from her Buffy work. Do not go if you only want to see movies that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough tension. I gave it a 7.
