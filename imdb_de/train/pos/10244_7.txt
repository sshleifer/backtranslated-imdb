I would not call "we're back! A dinosaur story" just a kids version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it challenges the certainty of bringing beings from one time into ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who has provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To put it this way: A certain actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" presenter, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN type. <br /> <br /> But I think I should not just focus on the cast. I thought that this movie has something to offer for both kids (pure fun) and adults (natural history). It is escapism, but the way of perception. I would really say that John Goodman, who plays Rex's voice here, is a kind of precursor to his vocal work in "Monsters Inc." is. Worth seeing.
