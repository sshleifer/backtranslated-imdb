The Caprica Episode (S01E01) is well suited as a pilot project. Really, this episode has exactly the same content as the DVD pilot version. With that said, Episode 01 provides a very solid background to the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). This is especially true for the 2007 series. As is the recent trend towards Sci-Fi, this series explores the "virtual" life or the environment. In addition, we get a lot of background knowledge about the Adama family lineage and their relationship with the undisclosed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. In this first episode, it is mostly about the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as one might expect) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed this episode better. Although it was neither new material for me nor anyone who has already seen the Caprica pilot's DVD release, the series looks very promising. As with many pilots, Episode 01 is a cliff hangar for an audience (sci-fi community) to play along with. In any case, I will continue to pay attention to determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
