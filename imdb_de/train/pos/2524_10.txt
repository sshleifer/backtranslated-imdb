I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as good as they were, and I did not expect them to be played in such an artistically well-developed film with enough action to interest you and so much variety to have it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I will be watching for the next movie. I especially like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it was not a cheesy vampire movie, nor about the fact. The characters all had human traits. The way the characters are growing has been incredibly tasteful, and you're really sorry that they're sorry for their entire lives. I'll give this movie two thumbs up. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
