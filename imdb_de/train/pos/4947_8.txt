One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to support someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all depends on loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I did not like." When you get to know Paz Vega, what is not? This smile from her can melt diamonds. She's just so amazing that I can see everything she's in. The same goes for Freeman. He is just magical on the canvas. <br /> <br /> They gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket via Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was tender, charming and just funny. <br /> <br /> You need to check this.
