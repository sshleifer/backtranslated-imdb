This movie could have been a silent movie; it certainly has the feeling of one. I was very happy to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase is a "symphony of love" and transcends all language versions. French, the ultimate romantic language, seems to be quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the canvas in this film, which in a sense is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic. Technical qualities may have been a bit rough; But that does not affect the magic that this movie radiates. Many lovers of early cinema would absolutely love this movie.
