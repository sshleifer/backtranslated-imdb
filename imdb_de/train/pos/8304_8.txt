I caught this movie late on Sunday evening / Sunday morning with my brother. We had drunk. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner, which is actually a roll-up ferry, complete with cast iron, to the doors with self-adhesive stickers on which the pole stands, and then the same door used for something else in another scene - this movie rocks !! The continuity is so bad that you can not help but notice it hits you with the holes in your face. In the last scene he jumps by ferry in the distance from a lifeboat. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The PR director of the ships, who knows Kung-Fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for his refusal), on the ferry, which very quickly leaves the explosion. ...... Then the dad is there and hugs her. As???? Who cares, it's magical. There is not a single redemption feature for this movie. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. If you are being followed by the villains, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of looking under the one-table, shoot down four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk right past the only hideout and allow our Casper to take care of them and "take them out". <br /> <br /> Get some buddies, get some drinks, put on the movie and howl.
