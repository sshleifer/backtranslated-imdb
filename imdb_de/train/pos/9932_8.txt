If you count on this movie, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway has called the "iceberg effect". On the surface, it's just a cache of random movie clips that are beaten up to make a movie. If this were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast, and if you do not really try to catch it, the storyline (along with a subtle foreshadowing) can be very good Well, come over. Definitely a movie you have to see twice to fully appreciate it. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this film. The camera work and the post-editing contribute significantly to the overall taste of the film and make it in some places quite artistic and interpretable in other places (which leaves something to be desired in the American films). Although it gets a bit shrill, cruel, and heavy in some places for some viewers, the movie never gets completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that I would describe as "worthy of improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. No film is ever good without a proper soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a bit too long and the other rap songs in the movie could have been replaced by something more appropriate (heavy, grunge-rock or psychedelic) electronica would have made this movie a real journey. The flooding of images and dynamic ... color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect, also in connection with the events that occur throughout the film. This is not a movie you can not ignore and still understand. However, this also makes it a desirable movie, and not one that gets bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
