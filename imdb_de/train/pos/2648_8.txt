Really the story of two kinky brothers and their respective cases falls from grace (through drug addiction) and later redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius, played by James Franco, is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less worthy of judgment as he falls prey to addiction as he grapples with the stress of meeting his family's expectations of both children. Not too cumbersome, as the drug fables would have it, and, overall, a fairly realistic sketch of family dynamics evoked by drug problems. I recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies, and I commend James Franco for his efforts, which were obviously love work.
