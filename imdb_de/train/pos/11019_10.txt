Cliffhanger is the last action movie by Slyvester Stallone before he became an underrated actor. It's about a mountaineer who has to help his friend after being taken hostage by mercenaries looking for three suitcases worth over $ 100 million. It has great action sequences, fun at the seat and a great time in the cinema.
