Although this film has a first-rate selection of outstanding actors, excellent special effects and a surprising story, it was not recorded for studio distribution and went straight to DVD. Maybe it contains too much information about "anti-police units" or it seems like too many action-flicks are triggered during a flood. Whatever the reason for the big screens, fortunately the new concept of DVD release allows us to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The topic is old: Rookie Reporter exposes an inner circle of corrupt police - in this case the FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of well-trained police officers who use the mythical city of Edison Deepest point at crime, drugs, prostitution, etc. wanted to clean up an opportunity and now, 15 years after its inception, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorism for innocent people, etc. The lead dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terribly right gangster!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buzz than usual and proof that he can be a sensitive actor.) Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) finds out A "bad mistake" and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to the head of his newspaper Ashford (the always reliable fine Morgan Freeman), Polack Ashford and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently good character actor) and Pollack help The closer Pollack gets to the truth, the more surprises and bad incidents happen, and the story comes to a series of unexpected results. <br/> <br /> Timberlake lacks the charisma to take the lead especially in the company of such experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott s make sure that the well-oiled machine of a film rolls to the end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's a movie that livens up the action in the seating area with a message. Grady harp
