Most people who have seen this movie believe that it is the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad guy and knows he's intimidating, and uses him to move on. It's about him and how he goes from washing up to a huge house and an office with cocaine all over the desk. If you want a family movie, this is not the way to go, but if you want gangsters and revenge and stuff like that, you'll like it.
