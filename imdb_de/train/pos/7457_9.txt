This is one of the best Bond games I have ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are very fun to play, they have a lot of action in them. They can be very hard Weapons that you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good, the driving missions are fun. This James Bond game has a good story. The voiceover actors in this game are really good and it's cool that Pierce Brosnan is in this game and the characters look really good because they look the way they look in real life. Also the graphics in this game is pretty good. <br /> <br /> overall rating ********* from **********
