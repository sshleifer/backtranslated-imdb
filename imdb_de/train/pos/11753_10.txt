Hello, I'm from Taft, California, and I like this movie because it shows how much we love people in the small town. Actors use us kids to play the games well. Show our determination that we've beaten Bakersfield every time for the last 6 years, and since I'm a senior next year, this is my last chance state and I'll be next if you want to get to know me. I'm Kyle Taylor, averaging seven to eight feet per carry. About five times per game, I have to rest on a 75 or around the yard run and go to our sports page
