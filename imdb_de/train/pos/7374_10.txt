For his first debut, this film has some exciting moments. In the best horror movie style, the pit of your stomach gets firmer every moment during this movie. The end is great. The creators of Blaire Witch have obviously seen that this film was not an end, but a beginning of the end. A great movie and just a part of Japan's great fear factor, a perfect score that makes you think and scare.
