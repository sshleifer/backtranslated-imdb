The Sunshine Boys are one of my favorite movies. It was the first time I saw it as a Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and has been thrilling ever since. In the end, I've seen it in cinemas 6 times, and if it were played today, I'd see it again. <br /> <br /> Now many critics mention the wonderful achievements of the leads. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune to have been nominated against Randall P. MacMurphy's Jack Nicholsons Oscar winner in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Burns won, although Richard Benjiman had at least earned the nomination The roles were perfectly played, as Fritz Feld for the potato chips commercial. <br /> <br /> This brings me to my point of reviewing this film, the direction of the heavily undervalued Herbert Ross. Ross, who previously brought two personage "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the canvas and made a complete film out of it, makes it again. He opens the pieces without looking like a photographic stage play. He fleas the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes before the movie, before we get to the scene where the play is opened, where Ben Clark comes to his uncle to inform him about the comedy special while play the first twenty minutes, The sequence itself is completely new. A few years ago, I saw what was wonderful in the Broadway revival of the game with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. But I think Ross and the scriptwriter, playwright Simon, have improved it. It's just a wonderful movie.
