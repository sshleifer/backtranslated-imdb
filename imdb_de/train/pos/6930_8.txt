This is a rather unusual and unique little western piece, mostly based on its history, which revolves around a unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle, and all those who once in the movie portray it, mostly original. > <br /> It's usually a very entertaining movie, but not without being a real western too. The film was filmed in a typical 40s / 50s style Western genre, so fans of the genre should not be put off by its somewhat unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Because the Gun is Since this is the main device of the film's storyline, the story may follow several characters in the course of the movie, which of course are all interconnected, and in the end, the story makes one complete circle. Without that, this movie would have been a pretty messy movie, as the story has often jumped from one dangerous occasion to another, constantly involving different characters. It's amazing how they even managed to integrate Wyatt Earp into this whole thing. But it's really not a criticism. I liked that the film and its story were original and how the movie seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the movie a sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a really good looking movie. I liked the settings the movie used, and it does seem pretty amazing that this was actually the first Western by director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he would later direct more Western, which James Stewart often starred in. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty daring decision to choose James Stewart as the lead. He is one of the softest and most polite-looking and acting actors, so it seems strange to consider him a tough gunman. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows how versatile and truly capable he is as an actor. <br /> <br /> It also has some other surprising actors in the film who are not often associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female lead and later the well-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
