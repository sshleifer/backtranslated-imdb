I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat that line and remember how good this show is. I'm a big science fiction fan and this show has the reason to be the most important science show (fiction?) In the history of the film / TV. There are so many theories in this series about the universe that I could start a religion. It's amazing that the show keeps improving from season to season. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old (now 19) and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows are star Richard Dean Anderson. It's also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> When I saw Stargate for the first time, I immediately liked him and considered him one of my favorite sci-fi movies. Then he heard one. The TV program would spin off, I got really excited, but got no showtime until the fifth season was almost over. <br /> <br /> Although I'm disappointed that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted a trilogy of films, the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> I would say that it turned out well. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is incredible and I hope she never dies. Atlantis here we come!
