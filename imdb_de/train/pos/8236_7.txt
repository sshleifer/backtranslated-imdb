By inventing a "The Domestication Collar," carnivorous zombies are brought under control and become productive members of society. However, they do minor tasks. The devout dead take care of the inhabitants of the fenced, 1950s American-style towns while untamed zombies roam the The Wild Zone. In the town of "Willard" lives K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinsons are the only family in their street that does not own a zombie. their new neighbors, the bottoms, have six. To keep up, the Robinsons get the zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido). Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's walker and he eats it. then new and hungry zombies invade the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has become accustomed to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like TVs "Timmy and Lassie") and the Robinson family has trouble working with the controlling "Zomcom" authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough into its own fascinating "Wild Zone"; But it's a colorful, stylish, and amusing satirical addition to zombie film education. Ray and the performers perform well, individually; with the nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and the crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), were rightly awarded prizes. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly and Dylan Baker
