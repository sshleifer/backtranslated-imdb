This movie has a clear storyline that is quite unusual for the music genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as a framework. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches on the core of human relationships, especially those of Indonesians. Despite the fact that the film is based on a "supposed" fairy tale, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" among Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, yet the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dancing by not scaring the fact that dance development in Indonesia tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem awkward in various ways and are not synchronized with the songs and / or the music. Nevertheless, I still love this film and see it as a new wave of the Indonesian film genre that I want to improve in the future.
