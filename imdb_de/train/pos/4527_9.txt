One of the ten best comedies ever! <br /> <br /> This seems to be such a joyful and easy comedy that sings. Keaton's comedies are _innerlich, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully amusing, deliberately sexy and imaginative. THREE AGES should be part of a draft of the ten best comedies, if I sketched one. A threefold love story will enchant the audience; I want to bring this rapprochement here? Keaton's comedy is upside down like Lang's DESTINY or Ã€ REBOURS. Again a couple traverses the waters of time and eras in the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's times, in a Mohammedan country, in the Renaissance of Italy and in China. The same device works in both films - a dark, eerie melodrama; - the other, a light, virtuoso comedy. At Keaton, it's basically the same couple; and maybe it's the same with Lang. The baby wanted by Buster and Beery is nice. I wrote THREE OLD well and found it smart, without being overbearingly sophisticated. The plot is basically very POPEYE-like the baby is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals Keaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is just enormously likable and maybe you would be tempted to say it looks like ambitious fun, but it's not, but it's great fun, great fun, lots of fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.
