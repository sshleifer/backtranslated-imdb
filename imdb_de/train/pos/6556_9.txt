I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single parent with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH that my girl has been so busy solving crimes and helping others! For me that might be Fantasyland at PG level. I read a lot of Nancy Drew books in my teenage years, a long time ago. Sure, this character was cleverly played by Emma Roberts, but NOT like the Nancy Drew I remember from the books. It's the script, not the drama. <br /> <br /> Emma is a delightful teenager who plays a self-confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught in the trendy competition around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, besides being similar to Nancy Drew's books and trying to figure out which decade we're in. I read the IMDb review before watching the movie when I watched Rachael Leigh Cook researched from other films. This is not her best role, but I will continue to search for her films. Rachael was too old to play the lead role, but does a good job as an adult orphan, central to the mystery. Some expect a perfect connection with the books, others expect more credible situations or an action movie for adults. I have what I expected! Good entertainment for young girls and their fathers looking for good children with high standards of performance. This is a teen PG movie, not James Bond! What would you wish for a role model for your teenage daughter?
