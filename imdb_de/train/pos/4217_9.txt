It is always satisfying when a detective closes a case and the criminal is brought to justice. In this case, the climax makes me even more happy. Seeing Abigail wiping off the smug grin when she realizes that her victim has left a "death testimony" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying performance, her character * really * really irritates * me. She is selfish and demanding. She finds her own way by performing a simple "little girl" portrayal that is embarrassing for a woman of her age. Worse, she has now set herself up as a judge, jury and executioner against the husband of her deceased niece. When Columbo gets too close, she tries to trouble him by manipulating him to make a cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies. He makes the table perfect by giving a very warm and humane speech about the realities of policing. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from seeking justice. Abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-esteem not to do his job well. Here's a situation you can not get out of Mrs Mitchell!
