I remember when this movie was for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For my life, I can not remember what was going on, but one thing I can say is that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg staged the film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's about the problems and troubles of a black woman as she grows from a girl to a woman. There are many allusions that are disturbing and frightening, but all are necessary to see how much this woman has accepted. Along the way, we see other women who have suffered their hardships and are going to salvation with them. Whoopi Goldberg shows her best performance in this film. Danny Glover should at least have been nominated for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best thing about this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, unlike some other show freaks shows like the newer "Beloved". I encourage everyone from every race to watch this movie. 9.10
