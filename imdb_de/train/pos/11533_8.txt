This movie, which opens with an interesting opening of two hot blondes hired behind a driverless, moving vehicle, has a rather peculiar personality. The cast of seven (even though a girl does not linger on body weight, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so low), is all extremely hot as our story revolves around teens celebrating out in the desert ( a strange but effective choice of attitude) being chased by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans driving a black truck. It's older than many of the vehicle-inspired slashers ("The Trip," "Joy Ride," "Jeepers Creepers"), in which the killer's vehicle itself becomes a nasty antagonist. The killer himself is pretty scary, and we find solace in the extremely sympathetic heroine in Jennifer McAllister (see the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil murderer in all black, while our benevolent heroine wears all white clothing, however frugal and stonewashed it may be) ). Director Bill Crain does some really cool stuff with his camera, a few tricks on screen, and the cast tries their best. The small number of bodybuilders is enough to thrill the fans, and enough T & A from a few girls to please the T & A fans. Overall, this film is heavily underrated in the Slasher movie world, as it is rarely found in the video. Highly recommended.
