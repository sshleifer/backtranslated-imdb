For those who believe it is strictly potty humor and immaturity, you are indeed the mindless one. The show contains a lot of jokes, but it also contains a lot of satirical material and is fun for social issues, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. All you have to do is read a little more into your material to get it. <br /> <br /> What I love is that not everything is a punchline. Who expects a formulated joke like Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), will not find him here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to make her humor more realistic. We do not go around the world and have funny punchlines for everything that is said in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> So do not take it as mindless humor because it's so much more.
