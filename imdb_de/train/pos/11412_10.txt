Beautiful and intelligent played by the two young girls Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is more of a part of the imagination. Young Hazel, who runs for mayor, seems frankly inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Although the play is well done by all concerned, the movie tends to have a real drama atmosphere. Maybe in the movies we have dealt with reality as if we were comparing Pollyanna to How Green What My Valley! Anyway, each of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, even though her role is somewhat subdued here. In the middle of the street, which are good for younger audiences, and how nice it is to enjoy beautiful classical music, which is almost a rarity. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a welcome change as it is calmer, thoughtful values ​​for the growing years and no violence, thank God. A warm family movie to enjoy.
