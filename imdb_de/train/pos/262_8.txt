*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie "The Divers" is really interesting. All I roughly knew was that it would speak Nazi history, underwater scenes and all Danish. However, I decided to investigate for one reason that the story is about a submerged German submarine from the Second World War. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially for wrecks that can be dived on. I was a bit skeptical of the Danish part, but said that the submarine could weigh this part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always so good and do not know how big the budget is, I was, to say the least, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I was ... surprised. <br /> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> <span> </ span> This was not a problem, both work very well. Just like the other actors, who are mostly people in their fifties and beyond. This leads to interesting interactions between young and old that are not often seen on screen. In no case unique, but something rare. And it's all good. <br /> <br /> As far as the Danish language is concerned, it is almost impossible to understand. This was not a problem, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself. I suspected that there would be indoor shots as well as underwater exteriors of the submarine. After deciding that their budget was low, I thought that at best, this could be appropriate and at worst terrible. Again I was surprised, the wreck's exterior scenes are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. With a fetish for German submarines I knew what the submarine should look like inside, and I was not disappointed. The team has researched seriously. Everything is good. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than I will see this movie just to see some scenes of the downfall, so I have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the movie is not a real model that existed during the war. It is a special purpose sub. To give you a hint of what to expect, this is a cross between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese transport submarine similar to the I-52. God is a good design and makes a nice wreck. <br /> <br /> The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I do not remember. It is summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the summer as every year. Her grandfather is a kind of sailor. The cinematography is quite nice, many beautiful summer scenes on the docks of the island, a newly discovered love for teens, nice diving weather and a general sense of "perfect". Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> With regard to the island, some suspicious visitors, a group of men renting one of the boats, an old minesweeper and his crew come. One of the visitors, a man in his fifties, tattooed the German eagle and the swastika on his back. The island's seniors all remember it when, at the end of World War II, a German submarine was sunk and since then rumors of Nazi gold have been heard in depth. The grandfather was one of the young men who had been searching for the submerged submarine shortly after German bodies had landed in 1945. No submarine was ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunts, secrecy, competition, childhood sweetheart, conspiracy and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it surprised me. Since he is not a big fan of supernatural events, he still fits in well with the story and poses no problem. It's not like "from dusk to dawn," where everyone ends up becoming vampires. This is a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: A really good movie, I gave it an 8. Some due to the fact that this is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later I learned that it had a reasonable budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if this was a Hollywood production, I would give her a 7 or 8. Yes, the story of a child in a certain way, but then again a mature story. It has a lot of excitement and a great adventure aura, which I found very appealing. And again, the cinematography is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
