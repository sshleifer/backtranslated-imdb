I've watched this movie at least fifty times and after seeing it for the first time in a long time last week, I still found it fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserves an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience all human emotions while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and got angry. Like most great movies, she was flown over by the Academy with a variety of nominations, but no victories. But this film is without a doubt one of the best films of all time.
