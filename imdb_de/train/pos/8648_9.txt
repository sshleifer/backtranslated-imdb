Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest street of all time. The road without return. The plot is about a couple who wanted to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role to date) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened in America, and his girl - this is a photographer - takes the pictures. They went on a trail of famous murders that did not know what to expect on the way. To share travel expenses, they choose another couple and place an ad. But the couple who answers is not an arbitrary couple. It is one of the strangest couples of all time. The girl is a naive, fragile creature that dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is just the opposite. A cruel, ruthless murderer. We hear this early in the movie and we follow him on the journey to California (not with C as usual, but with K, who probably symbolizes the word murderer) on his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. All the leads, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes, are doing really well, and you have to keep in mind that one of them was not a star in the movie. The photography is amazing, with the darkness covering most of the film, and the music matches the dark character of the film. On the whole, this is a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before you take a stranger in your car to share the gas!
