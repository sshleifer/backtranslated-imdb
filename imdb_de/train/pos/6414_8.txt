I was curious to know how critics reacted to this rousing, inspiring film. I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery, which are the film critics of our nation, had given the film an average of 43% (or "rumps"). ) rating. <br /> <br /> I can only say that if this film does not move you, you have no heart. (It's interesting to note that the same movie on the same site was rated 74% by viewers.) <br /> <br /> Not that the critics' opinion is all that matters to me. I can not imagine a more useless, overpaid profession. Some people are paid to go to the cinema (what a hard life) and do the same thing that everyone else in the world does: form an opinion. But these idiots have a way their opinion somehow looks, and it's more important than yours, and they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I admit that this movie is old fashioned (except for the f bombs), syrupy and a bit predictable ... after all, you know from the outset that Cuba Gooding Jr., the represents the true naval hero Carl Brashear, at every turn triumphs simply by the way he meets him: determined and courageous; Strong-willed and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and that of De Niro (as Billy Sunday, a figure made up of several real people) are so strong and so inspiring that you'll be there with your feet cheering on many scenes in the film, especially the highlight of the courtroom. You have to be a real stick in the mud so you do not get moved by these scenes. Like the movie critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is excellent and a good-natured, stuttering student who befriends Gooding's Brashear. If someone has seen "Higher Learning", this character triggers this character completely. <br /> <br /> That certainly confirms what I've always felt: do not listen to critics. Watch this movie and be inspired.
