I have to say, Seventeen & Missing is way better than I expected. The perception I took from the previews was that it would only be modest, but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive puzzle. <br /> <br /> Do not attend a so-called graduation party for a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and still goes to the party. When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something is wrong, and she has visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this kind, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this movie, and most of it is believable. This LMN Original Movie premiered last night. 10/10
