OK, let's make that clear. I'm not really into science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like a normal sci-fi series, but it is not! The plot does not play today in any distant millennium as in many other sci-fi series. I think that's great. It gives you things, events, and things you can identify with, and you can go into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. They have some, of course, but thanks to O'Neil, who likes to use simple terminology, there are not many. <br /> <br /> The series offers a nice mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy many special effects, you will not find them here. They do not use many bad ones, but a limited number of well-made special effects.
