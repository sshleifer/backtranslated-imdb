Having had the opportunity to see some of the filming in the Slavic Village on Broadway, I could not wait to see the final copy. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last Friday in the Cleveland Premier For a long time, a comedy! It's a great slapstick. The Russo brothers did a good job. The entire cast plays their best comedic acting ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great because he's the crippled Safe Breaker in this movie. Most impressed me William H. Macy as rogue "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto", they hold you in "stitches". I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
