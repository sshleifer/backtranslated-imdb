I'm sure most people already know the story - the stingy Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three ghosts (the spirits of Christmas, present, and present) who emphasize parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and changing his ways. The classic history of Dickens has proven in one form or another and has become a popular holiday favorites. <br /> <br /> While I saw the Alastair Sims version of Alastair Sims in 1951, I think it definitely is Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released in high school. George C. Scott is a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play the ghosts are pretty scary and menacing. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern movie styles (for the '80s) that make it tastier for my children than the black and white version of 1951. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story that I see almost every year during the Christmas season.
