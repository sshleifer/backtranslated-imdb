A Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only suitable for children but adults too. The story revolves around an ant colony and its fight against the evil locusts that return each year and steal their food (A Mirror of the Magnifiscent Seven). There are some wonderful computer animations and the voices are great as well. You will love it!! 8 out of 10
