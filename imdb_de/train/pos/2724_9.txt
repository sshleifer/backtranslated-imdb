Many of the classic films of the late '60s have not been given the ability to disturb and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" has lost nothing in power. It's exceptionally well done and makes the viewer think. Some have not only complained about the film, but also about Truman Capote's "non-fiction novel" that the central message is not subtle. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity does not affect the movie at all. It is refreshing, especially in the face of today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to watch a movie with a confident political voice without forcing the audience to look at its point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the main message of the film, but I still admire its audacity. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with the anti-capital punishment message, there is much to admire The Movie. The spectacle from the two leads is terrific. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is the nihilistic leader who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake also chills as the more submissive of the two and with conscience. His character obviously has a reasonable voice, but he's afraid to go against Wilson (there are a lot of homoerotic subtextes on his character). The cinematography is great, smooth and yet pithy and gives the impression that the viewer sees a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
