This is one of the few films I have seen twice in the theater. I love this movie because of its atmosphere and its story about the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but gets a chance for salvation. Is not that a comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I saw it for the first time, I thought the movie would be over after the elections won - I did not know the book. I was wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie. I can not understand this. Perhaps those who read the book first, as is often the case with screen adaptations of novels, are simply disappointed that so many things remain unimagined, unseen, unexplained. But as a film that tells a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is just great! Plus, the soundtrack is amazing and the cast is wonderful too - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of those films for which the cinema was invented!
