As a little boy, I've always hated "Cinderella" since I was overruled by my two sisters when my parents thought about which Disney movie to buy. I wanted "Dumbo" but my sisters won and we got "Cinderella". They really enjoyed the movie while I was sulking in the back of the room with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> A lot has changed since then. My love for the Disney theme parks brought me to an internship at Walt Disney World and I now have two young nieces. I like to show them Disney as best I can, and we recently watched "Cinderella" together. With my new appreciation for everything Disney is, I saw "Cinderella" from a new perspective and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, however, I did not quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a terrible position. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily and why could not she just run away? I was not too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as history progressed I plunged into the story. Maybe I attracted the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A dream is a wish your heart makes", brought me to the theme parks. I can imagine myself in this carefree and fun atmosphere when I see the impressive Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie just reminds of the magic of Disney. This may make a lot of people laugh but go to the magical kingdom and see all the little girls disguised like Cinderella, who are excited in this fantasy world, and you know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell embody why Disney is one of the most popular companies in the world. During "Cinderella" Do not be the strongest story, she is an icon in Disney and movie history. It's the funny, idealistic and fantasy-like miracle we had as children. I can imagine that this film has a great meaning for many, many people out there. It's not my favorite Disney movie, but it's all I love and admire about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Excellent)
