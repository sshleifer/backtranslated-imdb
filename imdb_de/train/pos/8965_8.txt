Produced in the same year as "Vertigo", the film is an equally captivating film, albeit in a much brighter vein. It takes place in enchanted New York in winter: Kim Novak is a witch who captivates James Stewart, but instead gets trapped in it. The interesting bottom line is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who spawned Madge's role in "Picnic" on Broadway (the role that would make Novak famous in the film).
