This is not an arthouse movie, but mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lots of nice people, T & A and action. I found it very entertaining. It should not be intellectually stimulating, it's a funny movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rent. So in summary, I would recommend it for a little Friday night chat with the boys or even with your girl (if she wants other girls to wear it!). <br /> <br /> The bad guys are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, the Hatters of Heroes. Very bad villains.
