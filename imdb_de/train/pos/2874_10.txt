Cinderella is a beautiful young woman cruelly treated by her wicked stepmother and step-sisters. One day a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to leave, because her stepmother and step-sisters do not allow her. With the help of her good fairy and her animal friends she goes to the ball, with the warning to come home until midnight. On the ball she meets the beautiful Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving one of her glass slippers behind. With the help of her animal friends her true identity is revealed. She and the prince marry later, and they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, published 56 years ago, was a big box-office success, and it continues to thrill audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A dream is a wish your heart makes," "So this is a love" and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" help tell the story. This was my favorite movie I grew up in and it has lost none of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to honor this movie. These include featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio shows, and a restored deduction of the movie!
