I first saw a title from this DVD on a hi-fi show in November 2006 in London (I was not really up to date yet !!) through a high-end Arcam system that excels with dts sounds. I had to get this DVD and I can tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. The performance of Cream at her age was just mind-blowing and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a music DVD. It does not matter what kind of music you like, this music will definitely grow with you. It is the sheer brilliance of her performance that she will see again and again. Even new musicians no longer cut the mustard like these old rockers these days.
