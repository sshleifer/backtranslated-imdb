Scanners II: The New Order is as good as the classic scanners by David Cronenberg. Scanners were made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so the two films have been different for eleven years. The film shows the style of scanners, which is a good thing, it would not be a scanner without a head explosion, so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that seems cruel first. Scanner II: The New Order has some other imaginative bloody scenes that are well done. The Scanners II: The New Order conspiracy is a new version of the series as the scanners are used as watchmen for a police chief and a group of scientists, until a young scanner called David Kellum discovers he is being used and decides to take revenge to take. <br /> <br /> Scanner II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classics and should be seen. Look at that. 10/10
