Every movie Bette Davis plays is worth experiencing. Before joining Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage," Davis had appeared in several films before. Legend has it that Davis was "robbed" of an Oskar's performance in 1935 as a cockney-speaking waitress, unmarried mother, and manipulative friend-user Mildred Rogers. The story goes that AFI honored Davis with her first Oscar for Joyce Heath in Dangerous. I can imagine that Davis fans of "Of Human Bondage", who agree with the Oscar-declining legend, will have the contrast to the film of 1934 in my criticism, for which the AFI their performance and the 1936 film "Dangerous" did not honor her for her first Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to watch Bette Davis movies, TV interviews, videos and ads for popular WWII & TV shows. In hindsight, it's easy to see why this movie "Of Human Bondage" gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for their performance. She was only 25 years old when the movie was done and was just before Hollywood's red carpet. The public noticed Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in "Of Human Bondage". That makes her her legendary achievement. But RKO saw her size in "The Man Who Played God" and borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'll go back AFI about 41 years in retrospect A clever decision to give Davis her first Oscar for "Best Actress" for "Dangerous", two years later. In this way, the AFI could have helped to highlight the best of one of Hollywood's most talented actors of the 20th century. Because since "Of Human Bondage" Davis knew for sure that she had to take deep in herself to find the performances that brought her the golden statue. No doubt she had earned more than two Oscars; maybe even up to 6. "Dangerous" provides an exemplary contrast in Davis' depth of focus characterization. Because in "Dangerous" (1936) she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, she's dead on the red carpet. In "Of Human Bondage," however, Davis is on the sidelines, still on the sidewalk, ready for the rest of her 60-year acting career. <br /> <br /> Maybe she did not give her the legendary Oscar Instead of a star, in 1935 an actor was offered the incentive to seek the celebrity in her soul for the greatest work of the gifted actor. It is known that her contemporary counterpart was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances are still not comparable to Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is also a radio host. Many people on stage and the screen are stars. Few have become great actors. The main difference between them is something that Bette Davis could feel: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to be in the star cluster. <br /> <br /> Compare these two films as I have them and look at each other one at a time. Maybe you'll recognize what the AFI & I did. Davis, 25yo, was about to become one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century, reaching his destination at age 27. She spent her next 50 years raising the bar so high that she was not reached. , , <br /> <br /> If the AFI had sent word that she had arrived in "Of Human Bondage," Davis's life story as a great actor might have been taken to a star dome instead.
