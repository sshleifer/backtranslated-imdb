I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Funny, I thought. Well, it's on video now and I saw it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid, but that makes them my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are fine, but the witty dialogue gets you started. I'm the kind of person who says I'm inspired by this movie. So if you like drama and other stuff, you should avoid it. But for everyone else have fun! The spectacle is great. Hank Azaria is undoubtedly the best (he is neither a commie nor a fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (er, do not correct me, it makes me sick) and then William H. Macy, who does his best (Fargo, the Fargo) Everyone has praised everyone from Macy to Garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as an Invisible Boy. Two problems: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the Casanova Probation. Some scenes do not bring the story in any way, but they are a great time. Kinka and especially the writers tend to move in one scene until all the fun is gone, but bam change them and you're ready for more. I swear, after you've seen that, you'll be tired of the explosive climax (which I thought was pretty cool). The camera is also pretty cool and moves with the actors at a furious pace. Plus, Tom Waits has an outstanding performance (he has that cool kind of cool hero coolness), and as others say, the best thing is when the characters show something human. Captain Amazing is pretty funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I rolled) and hurry as Casanova is pretty cool. Beef: The funniest comedian (Eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. All in all, a wonderful movie. I give him twenty stars and hope someday everyone will see the brilliance in the best parody of the movie, the Six Million Dollar Man. I'm laughing right now when I think about it. 20/10
