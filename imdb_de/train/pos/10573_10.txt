An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals of the early 1930s. The audience must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this vehicle type. Quite different than his "Public Enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney adds spark and interest to a more routinely exhausted plot and action. But the highlight of the film are the three elaborate production numbers back to back. First with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, then followed by the very spectacular "By A Waterfall" series, followed by the final "Shanghai Lil" sequence counter with Ruby Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number with Cagney is excellent, but after the more thrilling and unbelievably stunning "By A Waterfall" choreography a bit of Comedown & Anti-Climicic in the middle & close with "By A Waterfall", what the other 2 numbers blowing out of the water, so to speak & in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake. James Cagney's performance is additionally decorated with the cake. An outstanding musical achievement, a 4 star movie, the ultimate musical that is worth seeing, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
