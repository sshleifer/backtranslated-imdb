It has been a while since I saw this movie and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were funny together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse lead Moonshine into General Lee. As Boss Hogg drives the dukes out of their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local construction site to find coal samples. You quickly realize that Boss Hogg Hazzard County will strip unless the Dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy. My only two problems with the movie were that Burt Reynolds was not right for boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was far too serious. Otherwise, I recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
