I can not believe that this film is currently rated at 6.9. Still, this movie was probably one of the most touching real Indian films I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. As far as history is concerned, I thought it was great that Shahid Kapur was founded with Amrita Rao in an arranged marriage. He is a kind of happy guy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not attract as much attention as her aunt Amrita with a passion. This makes Amrita angry because she wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although Amrita's family was not so rich, perhaps only from the middle class to the lower class, while the Shahids' family was rather upscale, they nonetheless treated their family with respect and did not even ask what they did really would have hit me a nerve. That's because I've actually seen people being very rude to people who do not think so well, that they think under their standards, which I think is very flat. The film showed that the Shah's family was willing to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had grown up with, and a blind eye to the fact that she was not a rich business daughter or anything. All in all, this movie deserves an 8/10. I wish more and more such films were made.
