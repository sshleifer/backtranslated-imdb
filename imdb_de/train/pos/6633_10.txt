The first movie ever made. Workers are pouring out of a factory, some are cycling, most are running, moving to the right or left. In addition to Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the starting point for the cinema - with Melies begins the narrative, the cinema, the imagination, the artistry, the drama; in the Lumieres pure, unadorned observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of the cinema from the latter to the tired formulas of the first. <br /> <br /> But consider this again briefly. There is nothing "goal" about it. The movie is full of action - a static, inhuman scene breaks into life and activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is broken, shifted from back to right or left (but never the front where the camera is located). And yet the camera stands still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, assigns it to their will. The cinematographer may be a revolutionary invention, but it is used for conservative purposes - to depict, edit, constrain, limit, the world. Worse is the historical reality of the movie. These factory workers are employees of Lumiere. The bosses spy on their workers, the unseen gaze on his faceless henchmen. The film therefore describes two types of detention. Behind the gates, the workers are locked up at their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be a picture of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, which further restricts them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, a picture of an invisible, all-seeing authority capturing its servants. A frightening, overly prophetic film.
