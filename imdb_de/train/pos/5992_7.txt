I admit that I had no idea what I would expect from this highly stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the cold for everything I knew. It started with great visuals, little snippets that grab your attention and let your imagination run wild. Later, I quickly learned what was going on through voice-over. A nice little neo-noir story that I felt was no waist of a few minutes of my time. The small clues that the audience initially receives through visual elements give them a sense of accomplishment when they compose the plot. Together with a nice twist in the end, it's a cool overall package. The score, though not bad, almost gave the movie a music video. It just felt a bit old-fashioned and did not add anything to continue the story. Some performances felt too dramatic, but fit in perfectly with the overall impression. I am very satisfied. I received a lot of information in a short time, but it did not feel like rushing through great editing and voice-over work. Well done!
