Okay, like so many other such films that came out of a SNL sketch. However, Tim Meadows has done a fantastic job turning a three-minute, one-dimensional character into a moderately manageable movie character. He drops witty consistently threatened one-liners with decent frequency, Billy Dee Williams is there, although his Lando days are long gone and the whole thing is pretty well shot. It's not great art, but if you searched for the Gone With The Wind in Wayne's World, you did something wrong. Pleasant for what it is .......
