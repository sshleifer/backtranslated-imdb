Meryl Streep is such a genius. At least as an actress. I know she made fun of having done a lot of roles with accents, but she always sets the accent. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain was, as shown here, neither very personable nor so clever. But that makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she's worth all 10 of her Oscar nominations. There were some interesting things about the movie. I do not know much about Australia, but religious bigotry in the general public played a big role in the story. I had missed that for the most part when I saw the movie for the first time a few years ago, but yesterday it came through clearly. And it seems that the Australian press is as successful in persecuting and overcrowding misery as its American counterparts. A pretty good movie. A little different. Note B
