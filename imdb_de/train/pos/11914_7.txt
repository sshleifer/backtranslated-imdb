You know, this movie is not that great, but I mean, come on, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I think the plot is hilarious anyway. The father of this child says he would bring him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they will not do that) All the while (about the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end his dad does not take him back and drives his motorbike directly into this child's face. It's weird until Danny Glover takes it and his friend. <br /> <br /> I think the advantage is that the old lady is left alone to die with her sewing projects and her stories. The real winner, however, is God. Because later he got a job as an author for numerous strings shows. <br /> <br /> As a children's film he receives a 7. As a film about the secrets of blind, stupid faith and the nature of "God" "It gets a 10.
