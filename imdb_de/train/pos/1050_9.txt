This amazing documentary gives us an insight into the lives of brave women in Cameroon's judicial system - police officers, lawyers and judges. Despite tremendous difficulties - lack of funds, desperate human poverty, multiple languages ​​and several legal precedents, depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants - these bold, strong women make an impression. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspiring film that restores a little confidence in humanity. Despite the cruelty we see in the film, justice is accomplished thanks to these passionate, hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie is widely distributed in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
