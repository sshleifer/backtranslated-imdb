Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay in the 1940s and years before that. And I mean that positively, because I'm definitely not a Bay hater. His films are just high-quality entertainment, just like the films of Raoul Walsh in his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is good entertainment. In addition to a first-class director, there is also a cast of the first grade, in the lead role of the director of Raoul Walsh, Errol Flynn. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen. They used a very dynamic camera work that also made the boxing matches really uplifting and exciting, with the final battle against John L. Sullivan was the ultimate climax. <br /> <br /> Biopics of the 1940's and earlier obviously still differed significantly from today's biographies. Modern biographies often glorify their main theme and show his life from birth to death and everything in between, mostly emotional aspects. "Old" biopics were made as well as films that were not based on real people. This also means that the filmmakers often take a lot of creative freedom with the personality and events of the main character / life. Not only is this film a biography of a boxing legend, but it also forms a beautiful depiction from the days when illegal, bare ankle bouts entered the modern era of boxing life famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not many people knew it, but Flynn did really good acting jobs in the 1940s, one of which is film. Fysicaly he looks in top form. Incidentally, he looks quite different in this film without his typical little mustache. The film also features some good supporting actors and some good acting. <br /> <br /> A great and entertaining movie that still looks really good today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
