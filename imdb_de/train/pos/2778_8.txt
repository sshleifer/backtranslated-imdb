I saw that with few expectations and was totally thrilled! Bend it like Beckham is a pretty typical coming-of-age movie about a pretty atypical girl. This is Parminder Nagras ("ER") breakout role. She plays Jess, a teenager in England who is trapped between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (that's football for us Americans). And although she is much older than her character, she plays the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about friendship - especially Jess' friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her fellow player who also joins in with family concerns, especially with her mother, the purple nail polish and little bows on her She wears shoes, and Jules wants to be more feminine, wears lace underwear and flirts with boys and is afraid that her daughter's sport means lesbians. Jules and Jess both love to play and have problems convincing their families to let them go after their dreams. Unfortunately, both also love the same guy - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle strains the friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham gets into clich√©s. In other scenes, the scenes drag on for far too long, and this film could probably have benefited from a tighter overall process. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly funny movie about growing up, the culture fight and the love of football. It's about empowering women, chasing your dreams and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and funny, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that ... could and could. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8.10.
