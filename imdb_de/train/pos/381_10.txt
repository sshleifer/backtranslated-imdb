I did not give this film because it is an extremely consistent film, but because it has the pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman struggle against all contradictions is now an old clich√©, but few films have sold it with as much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. Another side of the experience of African Americans showed that after the freedom of slaves, many fell into the path of the hated "white man" and abused their own people. I think that this is an important point as it is directed against the "white on black", "violence against violence" and "Oscar victory" trends. <br /> <br /> Also, the acting performances are outstanding - especially Oprah, whom I have now. I have a new respect. <br /> <br /> Worth to look at - but keep a handkerchief handy.
