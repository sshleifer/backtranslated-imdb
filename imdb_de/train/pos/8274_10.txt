This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. Acting was great as well as costumes, production, photography, directing and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family stranded on vacation in the middle of nowhere after meeting a deer. A hunter appears and is very angry and outraged that a stag's antler is broken. Then he follows the family and strange things happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. That's worth it. Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up!
