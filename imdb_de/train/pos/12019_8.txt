I saw this movie in the Sky Cinema not too long ago. I have to admit, it was a really good western with two of the big names. On one side is Charlton Heston, who plays the notorious and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other side ... The late James Coburn playing the villainous Zach Provo. He seeks revenge on Burgade, no matter what it costs.! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was that there were really good characters. Most actors have played it really well. Especially James Coburn, whom I think was really mean in this movie. But that's how it was. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, the 'I've seen in other movies everywhere. Playing Hal Brickman ... I felt that his character was left in the cold, but he manages to reconnect by teaming up with Burgade to overthrow Provo's posse! /> All in all, it was a great movie. Very good to see. Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Wonderful piece of western persona ..! 8 out of 10.
