This movie is a gem because it moves with a soft, but fixed resolution. <br /> <br /> I would like to warn the audience, even though it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and Ms. Liu is there, she moves skillfully but quietly pace. It's NOT about explosions, chases or flying bullets. You have to be patient and write down the details here. It's quiet because that's the main character. The viewer must watch him and think about how this story develops. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because that destroys the point of watching. The storyline is what you read from the other postings: an average employee looking for variety and adventure, signing up for a company espionage job. Just go somewhere and secretly transfer insider data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a surreal walk - a mixture of corporate disillusionment that links to a fundamental, underlying suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Action is excellent everywhere - and yes, some of the acts are cartoon characters. But they all fit together and entertain them. And the light piano rhyme in the background is just as perfect as the soft, softkey, dark theme: in the beginning, not everything is right. <br /> <br /> And in the end: It's not all as it seems. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself comfortable and turn down the lights to see them - and turn the sound: this movie wants you to LISTEN.
