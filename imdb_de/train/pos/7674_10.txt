I was privileged to see "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese sold by her own family into prostitution and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes into Holly's life and decides that he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunification. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and sold every day. The film shows this difficult topic without crossing the border. I went away, wanted to know more about the problem of child trafficking and asked how I can help. This movie should be seen by everyone as it is a beautiful story that reveals a problem that we should no longer ignore.
