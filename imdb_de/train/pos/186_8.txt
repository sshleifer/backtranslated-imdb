There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act in the face of proper ownership; She is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines was able to take action, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular protagonists. (Until a potential scandal forced him out of business.) <br /> <br /> The story is a bit trivial, but it's handled so nicely it's not noticed. The direction of King Vidor is one of the main reasons for this. The producer? The young genius, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about filmmaking and you can see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors and directors. You see (briefly) some of the most important stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin makes a lap as himself and looks for an autograph. You'll also see Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who are just names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please also, if you are not a fan of the Silents, take the time to see this movie if you can. It is really a great time travel in the past.
