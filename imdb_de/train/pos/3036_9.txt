The name says it all. I saw this movie with my father when he came out, and after he served in Korea, he had great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this movie is that it only focuses on the man's life for a short time - interestingly enough, the whole life of the man would have given such an epic bio image that it's amazing to imagine the production cost. <br /> Eliminate some posters to the faulty features of the man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Duty, Honor, Land" is not just mere words marred by the lips of a scrutinized officer - it is the profound explanation of a man's total dedication to his country Ironically, Peck was the liberal who gave him a better Understanding of the man brought. He does a great job showing the fearless general who has been tempered with the humane side of the man.
