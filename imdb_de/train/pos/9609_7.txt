This was a pretty good movie that I liked. I thought it was a pretty close look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting. It's about having pain that is so deep that they have to find a way to handle it, and they choose to do it. Beth was a very well drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mother with the eating disorder, you can see the pain in her and hear her voice, and you know how deep the pain she feels is. I also think that one of the best lines in the movie is in where Beth yells the words, "It's not about you." to her mother These words were so true and added so much to the scene in the movie. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in this movie.
