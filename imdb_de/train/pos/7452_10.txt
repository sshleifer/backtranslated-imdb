I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and that's one of the best! It's funny, romantic and a classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for little kids because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and teens because it's funny and not over the top. I saw it when I was little, and I still watch it. It has great lines that my family and I quote all the time. Acting is great and never gets old. If you like fairytales and romances, you will love this. I've seen a lot of Cinderella movies in my time, and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the shows at the Faerie Tale Theater. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and entertaining.
