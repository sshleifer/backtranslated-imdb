I recently started riding horses, and as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim and tried to fill my life with as much horse stuff as I could, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a Disney movie that feels good every five minutes with talking animals and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What I got was an amazing movie, full of beautiful scenery and animations, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm your heart. <br /> Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West whose entire world collapses around him when he discovers that people are slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some people, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to see on screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story. and who has an appreciation for history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I think it's important, is that the animals do not talk in this movie. This was a really nice holiday from the animated films of Lady And The Tramp, which everyone knows today.
