I had heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw HBO one night in a single night, I put it on, unaware of how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He is better than Robin Williams ever was. He has total control over the audience. When he does that, 'Englebert is dead - no, he is not,' routine, the audience does not know what to think in the end. God as James Mason is also an inspiration, and his version of the Spanish Python Inquisition, as executed by the Church of England - "Cake or Death?" is invaluable. My jaw ached from laughing at the end of the show. We searched the TV recordings for months to see him again and were fortunate enough to record him the next time he came. If you have the chance to see this show, cancel everything and play it, you will not be disappointed.
