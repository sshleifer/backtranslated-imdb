I love the occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, who produced one of their greatest films in The Devil Rides Out (1968), have proved extremely capable in this area of ​​horror. This occult, tenth episode of Hammer's short-running television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss," is indeed a scary entry into the series. Director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched the Hammer oeuvre with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also led two "Fu Machu" films with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one from the more well-known names among the HHH directors, and he also delivers here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles over a mysterious old glass. The glass is an object of desire of a devil cult who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When he harbors a pretty young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor) to be sacrificed by the cult, Michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and his sinister leader (John Carson) ... While this is not an absolute must-have episodes of " Hammer House of Horror "(the best is clearly the brilliant seventh episode" The Silent Scream "), it's very scary and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists and turns throughout the movie exciting and eerie. Ray Lonnen makes a good track, convincing the young Rosalyin Landor as innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly scary as the leader of the Satanists. All in all, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and scary HHH story, and my colleagues at Hammer should not miss it.
