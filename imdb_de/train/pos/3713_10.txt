This film is all about style, atmosphere and acting. I did not believe all the plot's developments, but it did not matter - the grandiose drama, the unexpected turns of the phrase and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride, and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but also a master of accents. He proves it again with a flawless Georgia accent. He is surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz of Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was simply overwhelmed. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I never tire of looking at it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you probably have the chance), then I suggest you try it.
