After 7 years, when I saw this terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt pretty numb. Next Gen and DS9 were damn good stuff and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This opened a trek show with probably the best pilot. The crew was really good, as well as the selection of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula played a typical first captain in space and his unpolished approach was a refreshing change from the already familiar captains. The rest of the crew was very sympathetic in their roles and I think they had a good first season. When the show was canceled early, I was really disappointed. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast was capable of. Too bad that a movie or a TV movie was never considered. There was so much back story and founding of the Federation, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons.
