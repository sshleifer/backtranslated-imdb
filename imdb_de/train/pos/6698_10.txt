I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch and saw every single episode. I remember sitting at six in the evening every night, waiting for Nickelodeon to arrive, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to go down. The best series has to be if she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). From then on, the next series (Friends with Dreama) was still very good, but when she left high school, she just did not seem right. All the main characters were apparently left over, which meant she did not have that much of the old "sparkle", however, the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and observable, but when her aunt is left and Sabrina moves into her house it just is not right. She's not a teenager anymore, so the name of the show is not right and without Hilda, Zelda and Josh the show just does not seem right, especially when Sabrina marries almost someone who is not Harvey. Luckily, he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her. All in all, I still love watching the old episodes of Sabrina, the teenage witch, but I think the writers have gone too far and had to leave with Sabrina, who left high school. After that, the show definitely lost some of its magic
