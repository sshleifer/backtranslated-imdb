This movie is exciting, courageous and the music is very good. The movie Moonwalker should coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bad.It is excellent (*****). The movie begins with Michael Jackson's "Man In The Mirror" on stage. Then it shows a story of Michael from his beginnings in the Jackson 5 to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad the single). Afterwards, the Speed ​​Demon video will be shown. The song and the video are really, very good. Then the movie Moonwalker will be released. After a few minutes he plays in a club called club 30 Smooth Crime. Like when he makes the lean.
