This is one of the best musicals ever made. This is an example of where producers and directors were not afraid to select actors for their talent, and not for what people might expect. The lighting and the set are unique, which gives a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I can not think of). The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. The film is well-matched, beautifully played and interesting from beginning to end. A real joy is MUSIC. Such a number of first-class songs that are perfectly played and orchestrated from start to finish. In addition, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think that it is superior to many musicals of the thirties to sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which may have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this kind of movie. Another feature is that it is fresh every time you see it.
