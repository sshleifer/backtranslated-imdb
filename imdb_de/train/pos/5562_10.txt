That's the funnist from all Cheech & Chong flicks. It's the first one I've seen with these guys. I really liked it. My father actually recommended me to get it. What a great role model, and my grandmother actually bought it for me and knew what it was like. What kind of family do I have. Well, this movie is pretty good and great for rent if you want to see a good classic. I have to warn you, that's not funny. It has its moments, but not as funny as Mad about Mary. Check it anyway. I am sure you will laugh. Unless you are an anti-drug activist or something.
