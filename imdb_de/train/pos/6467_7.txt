Two films in a row, dealing with Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a man who gives up everything for someone, Deewaar focuses on the actual topic. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war rot for years in Pakistani prisons - for whom no Indian government. Time or sympathy still has the other side. I am sure that some of the Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a major, did well. Akshaye Khanna has done well. For Amrita Rao there was nothing to do but a few giggles and a few songs. I think Sanjay Dutt played a very solid role, even if it was not too long. He has behaved really well here and his willingness to talk was impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was nothing more than a one-day movie and the story went in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all the actors. 7.5 / 10
