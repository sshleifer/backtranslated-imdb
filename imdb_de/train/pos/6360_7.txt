I just read the main commentary on this movie, which is on the front page with the poll results and the cast down. <br /> <br /> Why some people can not take a movie as it should be. <br /> <br /> This movie should be a light-hearted, toned face, family comedy, things that make kids laugh and things for adults, and that's what this movie does. <br /> <br /> I laughed at my ridicule on this film, I thought Carey did a great job, and the whole movie (when watched for Christmas) really gives you some festive applause. <br /> <br /> So listen to everyone who hears movie critics stop trying to sound like movie students, and tap each movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they should be, entertainment !!
