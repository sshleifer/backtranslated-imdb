I did not know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but I thought it was great. It was dark, dramatic and enthralling. It also felt very authentic, I felt I had been transported back to the 19th century. I've never been a big fan of Heath Ledger. I've only seen him in teenage movies, but he's very convincing in that role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity and shows us how a very spirited boy became Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is a great supporting role as Kelly's lover. Highly recommended - and that from an Aussie!
