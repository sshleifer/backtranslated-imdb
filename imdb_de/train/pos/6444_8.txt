The line, of course, comes from the Lord's Prayer - "Thy will be done on earth as in heaven". Sweden, especially in the far north, is not my idea of ​​heaven. -30 ° C The winter temperatures are a bit too low for me, but the good people who live there undoubtedly believe that they are in God's own land. <br /> <br /> The plot here is a familiar one. Renowned international musician Daniel suffers from a health collapse mid-career and returns to the small village in northern Sweden where he was born. He was persuaded by the local pastor to help with the church choir, transforming an unusual talent into a class, and they participate in a competition in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the band players of "Brassed Off", the models of "Calendar Girls" and the dancers of "The Full Monty". Of course, it causes many emotional upheavals, as some of the more run-down villagers recognize their value and rebel against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. Despite the somewhat cheesy story, we get to know and like many of the characters who appear as humans rather than cartoons, though many of them are identifiable "types." I'm surprised that the woman's friend is not punished so long? Sweden is a country in the world where such violence is greatly encouraged (he was also a bit young (being one of the bullys of Daniel's youth) and the Puritan pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit stereotypical but became Michael Nyqvist is just wonderful as Daniel, the frail but driven musician, and there are also some nice pieces of music, I was thrilled for the whole two hours, the end is what you make of it, guess I, but it is not wrong to say that Daniel achieves what he has set himself.
