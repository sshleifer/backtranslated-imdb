This is a movie about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human mind. I challenge everyone not to shed a tear at the end of the film. This is more than just a joker, it is a captivating, thought-provoking drama with outstanding performances by all performers, but especially Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later, I am amazed that Luke is still a nearly unknown movie and Washington just made another movie. Apart from a slow accumulation, the story of the suffering and suffering of this foster child and his influence on him in adulthood is the kind of movie that will be seen long after you. Like many pictures of Fox headlights, this was rather a sleeper hit and did not get the mass critic it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally met his mother summed up the film for me. There were as many ways to do it, and it could all have been slimy or unrealistic, but Washington had just the right tone, his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while Antowne simply asked why , Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything. What could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving movie scenes I have ever seen.
