How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us suspect. Shall we Dance? is not a movie about dancing. It's about learning something about yourself, recognizing what we're looking for in life, and having the courage to search for it. Mr. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where dancing is considered inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing academy. He is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and is afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he participates in dance classes, in front of his colleagues and his family. <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene in the men's room of the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a work colleague who also dances, are interrupted in practicing dance steps. There are many other funny and warm scenes. <br /> <br /> The end is not a fairy tale, but the viewer feels good. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand the Japanese people a bit better. It is a warm and very rewarding movie.
