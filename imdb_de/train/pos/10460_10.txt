This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and salvation. I loved the transformation of the brother and the impact of the terrible illness on the family. Good-natured and purposeful. If there were any shortcomings, I have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a movie showing all these cultures - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film has increased in terms of its values ​​and understanding of how a disease can bring somebody closer to its creator. I really liked the movie and it brought tears to my eyes
