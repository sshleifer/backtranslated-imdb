I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, on a Saturday night alone in my parents' basement. It was shown on "Chiller Theater", a regular scare that I have seen religiously as a young Uno. Now, thanks Chiller Theater I saw a lot of old horror movies, but none has so held me like "Danse Macabre" or "Castle of Blood". I am now 51 years old, and until last year I had to find a relatively newer, high-quality DVD edition of this wonderful shocking supernatural classic lucky, because I thought I would never see it again. I have seen it four times already and do not seem to get tired. <br /> <br /> They just do not make any more spooky movies like this one. Ghostly catacombs and misty cemeteries just do not work as well in color as they used to do in black and white. In any event, Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, delicious shadowy, wrapped in cobwebs haunted castles, restless spirits, who re-enact her death ... and an ironic end. This equals up with Robert Wise's "The Haunting," "The Innocents" (Deborah Kerr) and the more recent "The Others".
