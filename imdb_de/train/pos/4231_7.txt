On the way back from a Christmas trip to Christmas Eve, a battered housewife in front of the city (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a disagreement with a group of juvenile offenders has taken a violent turn Just to the DVD release here in the UK, Susan Montford's directorial debut may be do not get the recognition it deserves. That's a shame, because the standard of writing, governing and acting is indeed very good and surpasses the quality of your average directly on DVD strips. Kim Basinger has been showing her best performance for some time as an oppressed spouse of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer does not really have anything more to do than to be a menacing presence, Basinger connects with each other in her short scenes - she shows painful vulnerability and points to the anger that is boiled over in her quarrels with the teens. It's a really great, unobtrusive performance, their transformation from victim to attacker is played seamlessly. Lukas Haas, I initially thought was wrong, since he (along with the other three teenagers) just did not seem much a threat. If, however, all four youngsters had been physically more impressive, the later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that these are four average men, if a little bit out of touch, is the key to why the movie works as well as it does. Apart from a few pacemaker problems in the second half of the movie and a few cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually gives the viewer something to think about when the movie is over. Some may be deterred by the slow burning of the opening scenes or the abrupt end. Others through the sometimes brutal violence. I say, give him a chance, it's certainly more time for you than Saw V.
