Damn, that was a lot to take away. I was fascinated through and through. It was pretty perfect, though I would say the cut had something to do with it. I can not believe this guy worked well with most of them (especially Anton) to get all that stuff raw without serious ... beef. The dandies were good together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which many other people might not feel. Great filmmaking and wide selection of topics. I can recommend it to any music / movie fan. You will probably learn something about filmmaking.
