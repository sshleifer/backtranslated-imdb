A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar-winning performance) being persecuted by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge that betrays his leader for a reward during the Irish Sinn Fein rebellion. The scenes of fighting and mob action are very realistic and focus on the desperation within the individual. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford creates a murky and tense atmosphere that is enhanced by the misty and dirty appearance of the Irish countryside. The dramatic music score by Max Steiner contributes to the cinematic pleasure. Oscar winner also for the best screenplay, nominated for the best picture. This is one of the classics of Hollywood.
