I have seen this film criticized by saying, "If you can overcome moralization ...". Moralization is in the conscience of the beholder, so to speak. This is a decent movie with a standard thriller, but with a distinct twist that pops up in the middle. The resolution makes the viewer wonder, "What would I have done in this position?" And I have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended. For this purpose and until the end of the audience's entertainment, the film succeeds. I also like the way that violence is never on stage, just in front of the camera. We know what just happened. It just will not be served in front of us, then it rubs our faces as it would with contemporary blood and bloodshed today. Besides, violence is not the point. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, which is skilfully, if disturbingly, solved.
