The entire film is only worth seeing for the great closing moment - it's the best end of a movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this film attractive, even if it is about its self-serious meaning in France. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I love the way the Algerians were woven - and by the way, the music during the credits is great. I want the CD!
