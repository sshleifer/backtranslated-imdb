Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Similar to Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls one could say was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who are not interested in theater, cinema, musicals and the like are annoying. This is not a typical TV program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to have a more linear and subdued tone to make them happy. This program explodes with color, winking at old movie scenes, buzzing with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the decisions that are made from the costume to the leitmotif. The story requires many twists and turns, but all are very accessible because the talks are about love, honesty, courage, loss, and many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show and that was done quickly as Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not consider this as a typical television program. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy it!
