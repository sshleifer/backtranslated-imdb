The fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting that you can enjoy. The museum landscape is like a nice music video. The sex scene in Apres is a well-known scene throughout our adult lives. but the film would not be of any interest to me without keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. Almost everything I know about acting came from the study of his eyes. he had the most convincing face. His character possesses the qualities that I see in a man, sensitivity and devotion. Keith Gordon is beautiful. By the way, I wish he would shave his beard now, since his lips, his chin, and Adam's apple are his finest set beside his eyes.
