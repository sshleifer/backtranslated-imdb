JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalf's drama "Strange Snow" (also written by Metcalfe), which was judged sensitively by David Hugh Jones. He examines the too-forgotten effects of the battle on veterans who are permanently damaged by the heinous warfare. It is particularly poignant to return to this 1989 film as we see the soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the raw treatment they receive at our Veterans' Hospitals. Three friends converged on the Vietnam War and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men were suffering in the battle, the David 'High School' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so badly damaged by the post-traumatic stress disorder that he is in one drunken vacuum with its very simple level "exists" teacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker). When David gets worse, his buddy Joseph 'Jacknife' returns. Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city to help his friend. In the course of the events Jacknife offers first Martha and finally the two appointments - on a Prom Martha - in the Proma must attend. The drunken David breaks up completely, destroys relics in the school and terrifies the citizens and students. Jacknife lets Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost her buddy, bringing David to the point where he can begin his ascent towards recovery. And also the longtime Martha finds that her needs are determined by Jacknife. All three actors perform surprisingly well: Ed Harris offers one of his best-realized roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. More people should help revive this far from forgotten film, a fragile reminder of the damage our wars are inflicting on the men they fight and the families they receive after the fight. Highly recommended. Grady harp
