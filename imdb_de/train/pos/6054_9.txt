I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT, as I heard about it in some motorcycle magazines. Although I was mainly racing, the temptation to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) was enough to keep me from beer and celebration. Last but not least! We made it! We Brits have indeed made a great motorcycle movie (and no, it's not like Torque). This is the best British comedy. Mark my words, this is the best screen performance by Phil Daniels, and for Geoff Bell, there is a new British legend that makes his name. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadow's awesome Dead Mans Shoes, and here's a soft-touch performance that he can proudly add to his growing movie reputation. This is a movie not only for us bikers, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope it will get the same brilliant response on the mainland as on the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of certain classic scenes of this movie (watch out for the shop) as this would spoil the fun, but I would say, see, enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had a while. I really believe that this could be a cult classic. As you said at the TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
