The film is great, like any other international project that contains strong impressions. three of them (israel, bosnia and egypt) were said to have been cut out. especially a Bosnian clip that is pathetic beyond all reason and does not contain any thought or element of its own. Everything else is really great and unrecognizable to most Americans who are known to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, clips talk about the misery of people around the world. and, as I see it, there are so many of those who will not bother about it. Imamura
