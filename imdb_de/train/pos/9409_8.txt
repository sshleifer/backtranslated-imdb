A chemist develops a fabric that is never polluted or worn, but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. In this sexy Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is wonderful as a meek but persistent chemist. Greenwood plays the love interest with her sensual voice; Parker is her harried father. Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the textile industry. While the film tells an exciting story, it also raises some interesting questions about science, business and politics. It is cleverly directed by Mackendrick, who later in the 1950s was to do "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success".
