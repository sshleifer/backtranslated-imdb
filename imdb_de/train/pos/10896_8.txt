At first I did not think Ben Affleck could really make a funny Christmas movie, kid, I was wrong, my daughter invited me to see it with her and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O'Hara was good too. The story is what really sold me. I mean, I have family too but once or twice a year, and you probably will not get along anyway. You really need as much alcohol as you can tolerate with your system, so I thought the premise was good there. The $ 250,000 family was a bit far-fetched, but it turned out to be pretty good for me, because it was a riot throughout, it shows the class struggle of the different families. There are many funny moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager. All in all, I loved this movie and will see it next Christmas or earlier if my daughter wants it too.
