I'm not surprised it's a good movie by the same director who made "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved". Ironically, "Paper House" is a movie I've never heard of before, but it must be one of the best movies of the late '80s - also because it surpasses the worst movie stage of the last few decades. (It is not spoken here about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" ...) The spectacle is not brilliant, but only solid - unlike what some people claim here (they must have dreamed this "miraculous spectacle", similar to Anna ). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that holds all loose ends together neatly. These unanswered questions are probably deliberately left there, which is left to the interpretation of the individual, and there is nothing wrong with a topic like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mixture of children's film and horror, in which sounds and music are used effectively. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical clich√©, an ultra-shy, but secretly brilliant, socially excluded girl, but a normal, normal kid. very refreshing I'm tired of writers projecting their own inappropriate childhoods into their books and screens, as if someone wants to care or read about another miserable, lonely childhood, as if it's all there or as if it were The character background has a monopoly on good potential. The scene where Anna and the boy "smooched" for a while was a bit much - which provoked feelings of indefinite disgust and amusement - considering that she was only eleven, but it turned out that Burke, 13, was 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they did not improve the figure's age or have a younger actress. It was obvious Burke was not that young. Why directors make children older than what they play water down realism, I'll never know.
