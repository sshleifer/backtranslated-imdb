This is not the best movie by Bela Lagosi, but he has a good old approach to horror entertainment in the 1940's. <br /> <br /> Brides are dead like flies at the altar. I think I would postpone the wedding until the friend is trapped, but it's a horror movie. I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging, sick wife healthy and happy. He always escapes the Keystone Cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would like to search for a corpse in a hearse?), And the brides are simply jagged. <br /> <br /> No movie would look complete without a Lois Lane reporter trying to catch the criminal alone. Good at solving crimes, bad to keep your mouth shut at the wrong times, guess who Lagosi is picking for his next intended victim. I love the "haunted house" where Lois Lane, as a guest in Lagosis's sinister mansion, is stranded by a thunderstorm. Hidden passages, a vampire-like woman, a bad dwarf, Igor assistant and so on. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Pretty well-made pacing keeps the movie moving, and the story dissolves in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this movie is worth it.
