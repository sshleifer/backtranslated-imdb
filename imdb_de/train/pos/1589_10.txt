I love this program. I look at all the repetitions every day, even though I've seen them every six times. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York York. Holly goes to Val when her father comes to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems that Vall and Holly are going through. The main problem is guys, but it's also about being responsible and making other choices. Holly is 16 and is an absolute free spirit, while Val is the opposite. It is the organized organization that has a plan to execute some kind of person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
