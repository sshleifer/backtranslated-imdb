"A truly beautiful story with a moral of brotherly love," describes this unusual David Lynch movie. This was especially "weird" because it was not the movie Lynch had released in the last 15 to 20 years. These were dark and shocking movies (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and that's the opposite. I know that it has disappointed many of his fans. Others were excited. Count me to the latter, and I also own all three of these "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another supposed life story that details the journey of an elderly man in a seated lawnmower from West Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother with whom he has been Years ago, but wants to see it before it dies. Well, I think that premise - an old man driving a lawnmower 400 miles - still makes this movie a "weird" movie, so Lynch stays in character! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He's the type of man, face to face, voice, and reserved personality that almost everyone likes. The wrinkles in his face tell a lot. It was so sad to hear what happened to him a year after the release of this movie in real life. The first 25 minutes of this film are not much and not always pleasant, as it shows the main thing The Sissy Spacek's adult and mentally handicapped child and their tragic past, but as soon as Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) has begun his journey, the History. I played this for several friends, and they thought the movie was NEVER recorded, but I'm more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. It was a sleeping pill for her. <br /> <br /> I found his journey very intriguing, but you have to realize in advance that this is not going to be an exciting Lynch crime story. It's slow, and if you're right, you might like it. Charm meets the picture of some people Alvin encounters along the way, such as a fleeting young girl who ran away and nice citizens who help the old man when he gets into trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in this regard.") Harry Dean Stanton receives the third bill, but that's a joke: He's only in the last few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> The landscape of Iowa It is pleasant, I have lived there for several years and can witness the gentle hills and the rich soil, it is a beautiful state with nice people ... like this movie.
