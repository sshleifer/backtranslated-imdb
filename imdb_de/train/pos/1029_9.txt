I would have rated the show the perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high-quality story and character development if the final episode of Season 10 had not been! <br /> <br /> The final episode of Season 10, "Unending," in which the Asgard (seemingly killed in a very hectic, unconvincing and very unceremonious way), has made me incredulous! <br /> <br /> At the extremely tense end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story-sheets were originally scheduled for at least another season. My guess would be that they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the next two direct-to-DVD moves! If not the Asgard in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation for the "apparent" extinction.) I think the fans were cheated on a bad cleaning of the loose ends. <br /> <br /> Bad End of an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
