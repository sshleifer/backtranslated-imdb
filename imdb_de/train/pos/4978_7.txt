A beautiful Shirely temple. Children actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for this day and time. Maybe it had to be "seen and not heard". Besides, that's fun. Given the film era, there are certain aspects from a social perspective that make me seem very progressive and liberal. I will not go into that here, I prefer not to indulge you, but let yourself be seen and see if you discover these elements. Even at the beginning, it was easy to see what fascination was already developing for Temple. So it's worth it if you're a Temple fan. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while you wait for your good night-glass of milk to warm on the stove.
