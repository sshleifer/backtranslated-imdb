I saw this movie with my children's eyes and was not disappointed. The story is known, some abandoned orphans must be brought by an unlikely trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal) to his parents his hasenuss. This really made me laugh throughout the picture. <br /> <br /> In short, it works, it's funny and it's a "must" with your kids (they'll like it).
