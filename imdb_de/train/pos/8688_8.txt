A very demanding Columbo story, which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series, but was originally transferred (after "Murder By The Book") to the second. Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as a guest killer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency that blackmailes the wife (Patricia Crowley) of a wealthy, influential businessman (very sympathetically played by Ray Milland) after making a report in their favor After it was discovered, she had an affair. The woman later rebels against the blackmail, but is killed in a tantrum .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many ways, especially as the plot is so strong and then developed because of the rare columbo Ingredient that the crime is an intentional killing. The whole thing will be improved if the widowed husband uses the killer to aid Columbo in his investigation. A feature that allows for numerous scenes of good quality, especially in the first sequence, when the three main characters meet and prove Columbus's deceptive qualities wonderful. <br /> <br /> Conducted with great flair by Bernard L. Kowalski and traded at a reasonably high level, this really set the tone for the entire series (as "Murder By The Book" was disappointed by a bad ending) , The script of Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link is precise, well-structured and thought-out, backed by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences that truly show the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the finale is the right proof that Columbo was always one step ahead of the killer. All in all, this is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo, suggesting that the production team has been positive and constructively a polished Columbo story.
