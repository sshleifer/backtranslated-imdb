Good: rousing film fights, great presentations, vehicles are really fun, pretty responsive multiplayer, staying true to the movie, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: The main missions are a bit short. <Br /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third-person shooter (not necessarily a spy game) is. Great firefights continue the story, letting EVERY single mission complete and unlocking all the real bonuses the game has to offer. The hype this game has been fulfilled, and I personally think you should buy it and meet some friends and play it. Have fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is an incredible success from some previous Bond games. When you fire a weapon, it feels like you're firing a weapon. It is related to the aspect that you are a deadly and merciless spy. All in all, this game makes you excited and content after you make it, and a multiplayer that complies with the standards of the smart James Bond "Nightfire" game for the gaming cube.
