I remembered that this was one of my favorite books, and I had wanted to read it to my 5-year-old daughter for some time. I knew the movie would be out soon, so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare it. Not necessary The only thing common between the book and the movie is the first name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet and eats a lot of worm. Oh yes, I almost forgot that the boy who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces in a French accent. How the children know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet was made, the number of worms to eat, the time frame in which the worms must be eaten, how they are cooked, the progress of the friendships, the highlight scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all pleasing and the movie did not disappoint. A word of caution for the parents, there was a moment when the adults in the room were allowed to breathe collectively, and at that moment, Billy's little brother called his penis a "fat cock." The embarrassing part came when my daughter asked the people around, "Does anyone know what a dick is?" lol. This and an occasional "shut up" is as evil-minded as this movie will be. My daughter thought she might get sick with worms 3 and 4 (and kept the empty nacho container just in case), but was fine with worm 6. She and I really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
