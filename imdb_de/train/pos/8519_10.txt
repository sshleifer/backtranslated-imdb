Amazing ..... This may have been a poor attempt to recreate the already created Omen movie, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> The last man to comment is a fool. This movie was one of those, and Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> Great suggestions from me to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror films and soundtracks So listen to what I have to say, not the other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate Me, the endings. <br /> <br /> According to the prophecy, it is all inaccurate, including final conflicts and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion: There are great films ... and should be seen before the global economic crisis hits us and before the Democrats Take over the presidency too. <br /> <br /> So signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, with a mastermind.
