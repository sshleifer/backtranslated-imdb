Sudden Impact is the fourth of the Dirty Harry movies and one of the best features of these films is that they do not really deteriorate from one movie to the next in their quality. Thus, Sudden Impact offers another exciting ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry is trying to solve a series of murders on vacation. Harry seems to be always at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his active, slow, intentional, and fearless men. The first of the Dirty Harry films shot in the '80s, Sudden Impact lacks some of the' 70s feel that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that the quality is not lower. Conclusion: Sudden Impact is full of intensity and action and another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.
