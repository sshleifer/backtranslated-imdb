This is a movie that takes some time to get out of your mind as soon as you see it. The dialogues are near perfect, which was to be expected since it was adapted from a play. The actors just do their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is absolutely believable in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the pretty blonde (but not so stupid) that pleases the eyes as well as the ears Paul Rouve offers an excellent approach to the total idiot (and is proud to be one), and Marina Fois is the dumb friend who always pats when least expected. Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and staff for adapting this excellent game and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more in today's production. If you like it, you will probably also enjoy "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the couple Bacri / Jaoui.
