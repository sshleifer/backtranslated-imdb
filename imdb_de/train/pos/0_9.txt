Bromwell High is a comic-comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as: Eg "teacher". After 35 years in the teaching profession, I believe that the satire of Bromwell High is much closer to reality than "Teachers". The struggle for financial survival, the enlightened students who can see through the pomp of their miserable teachers, the pettiness of the whole situation reminds me all of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately remembered ......... um .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults my age think that Bromwell High is far-fetched. What a pity it is not!
