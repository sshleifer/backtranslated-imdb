Who can watch a movie, watch Lucy Liu and not be overjoyed. This woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. This is a difficult combination that you have to find a few days now. And Jeremy Northam. I've heard his name many times, but I've never really noticed it. My advice to Hollywood is "use it more". <br /> <br /> now to the movie: I saw him in one of my graveyard layers. I can not recommend that to anyone. It is a little too complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe I did not see the end coming. I will not say why the whole movie is spoiled. although it is said that this is perishable enough. <br /> <br /> Now I should cast my vote about this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actors have done a good job and I love the work of the directors (Natali) in the past. There is not a big audience for this, it's pretty risky too. You know, I'll only give this job an 8, because everyone should see that. With 1 point deduction there is always room for improvement.
