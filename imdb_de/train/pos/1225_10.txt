Does anyone know where or how I can get a copy of this movie? !! I've searched far too long, someone helps! In 1997, my friends and co-stars in this film were on Long Island, and we've never actually seen it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping I could somehow find a copy so that I can finally check it and share it with the girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where he gets a copy of it? I can stop driving myself crazy (even though it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age myself.) If you or someone you know has a copy of this movie, please help to pay for a good copy of it!
