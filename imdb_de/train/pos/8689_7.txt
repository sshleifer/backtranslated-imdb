Perfect cast for a few person drama. Simon is dead, but somehow he awakens from the outside. What he saw there is shown in the form of empty spots arranged by the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze into a great score. Simon is persecuted by his death, comforted by the support of deaths he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but fails and decides to follow him after his final death. Very sensitive and moving, deep psychic, but a bit slow and boring somewhere.
