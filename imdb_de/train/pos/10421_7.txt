This is a very nice movie. The color photography is beautiful because it shows the waste of the Metropolitan Opera in brilliant colors. Other interior scenes in different villas etc. are just as brilliant. As far as the music is concerned, one can say more than that Lanza's voice was at its peak when he sang so many of the most famous and popular arias in the world. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a pleasure, because her soprano voice merges with that of Lanza in charming harmony. Of course, Hollywood took its usual liberties with the life story of Caruso. There is hardly anything in the story that relates to actual events. For example, the facts relating to his death are completely invented and have no relation to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These websites can be found by using a good search engine. There are also several books about his life story. But the fictive action can not affect this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and the choir members are the true stars of this film. Have fun, I know that I really did.
