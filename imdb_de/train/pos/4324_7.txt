You do not have to read this review. <br /> <br /> In a previous review of Seattle's pninson, all the major flaws in this production have been identified. I can only reinforce his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and much darker than his previous work. This is taken too literally by the director Ross Devenish, who stacks too much on the darkness and the fog. When Ada, Rick, and Esther arrive half an hour after the beginning of the opening episode, it's a relief to be in daylight only for the first time. In some dark scenes, it was hard to tell what was actually on my TV screen. I watched the whole thing in one day and started in the afternoon. As daylight faded, it was less of a problem, but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The pace is very intentional (ie slow). I'm sure that was intense, but it's overkill. There are numerous shots of people shuffling through the hustle and bustle of Victorian London, which is kept longer than necessary to create mood and atmosphere. A good editor could possibly take several minutes out of each fifty-minute episode without losing a line of dialogue by trimming each of these scenes a bit. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two issues. They soon adapt to the look and pace of this production. The more important point is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Earlier Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House, but are far from being so complicated. For example, I recently read Nicholas Nickleby again because I was intrigued to see Douglas McGrath stuff an 800-page book into his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is fully padded. McGrath cut down much of the novel, keeping all the essentials of the story alive. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production takes seven hours. It probably takes even longer because many elements of its interlaced representation are not clear enough or handled as well as they need to be. Some random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The maid Rosa appears from nowhere with no background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment to her is largely unmotivated. Sergeant George's Assent In Tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of Horton's manuscript, something is faked. <br /> <br /> It's not clear enough that Esther actually falls in love with Woodcourt when she marries John Jarndyce. It is also not clear that they have agreed not to announce their commitment, or why. Ada and Rick's secret marriage is omitted. In one episode, they are only lovers, the next, people suddenly refer to them as husband and wife. Ms. Rouncewell is introduced only at a late date in history and in Sargeant George's alienation from his family remains unresolved - as well as the means by which she is discovered. Tulkinhorn's commitment to upholding the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is unremarkable, so his motive for the persecution of Lady Dedlock is darker than necessary. <br /> <br /> The involvement of brickmakers in Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is a bit obscure. <br /> <br /> It's not obvious that Guppy renewed his offer to Esther because of her pockmarks are as good as gone. <br /> <br /> This is just a selection: There are others. They are not big problems and the main focus of the story is clear enough. Nevertheless, it is small irritations that affect his strength: you should not puzzle over small plotting points. However, there are more important structural issues that weaken history in later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole thing about the murder of Tulkinhorn is a bit thrown away. Bucket immediately identifies Hortense as a suspect, undermining the strain of Sergeant George's situation and the importance of Mrs. Rouncewell. It also reduces the impact of the transaction suspecting Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is demasked before Sir Lester. A serious problem is that the murder of your investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate the story for over an hour. During this time we completely lose sight of the other main thread of action: the legal case and its impact on Rick. His failing finances, his failure by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his health and so on are all shelved for a whole episode. Maybe Dickens wrote the book like that (I have not read it in years), but a good script should help to bring the different storylines together. <br /> <br /> Finally, Smallweed's role in the story is so small that it is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will that triggers the final phase of the story is also thrown away. It happens outside the screen. Nevertheless, it is still a very good production. Many of the services are outstanding. Single scenes are beautifully realized. The accumulating feeling of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation of a great book if it had not been for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably would not be fully aware of the flaws if I had not seen Andrew Davies doing better. I've been critical of Davies Jane Austen's adaptations, but I have to admit he really knows how to tame Dickens' extensive books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and gripping drama worth seven hours each time. However, his probable fate is mainly seen as a cross-reference to the almost final version of 2005.
