I do not think such a movie would be released today. It takes time to showcase the depth of the characters, and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you at the edge of the seat as families deal with grief. Like when the language silences us to heal and overcome tremendous loss and instead we rely on raw emotions. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a little boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother in the hunt) in the movie becomes more than his fair share. He finally leaves and moves to his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who makes it clear to him that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew this in his heart, but I had to hear those words from his parents and receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie was the lack of dialogue. The physical reaction, the facial expression, was enormously important. The slower pace of the movie allows you to really watch the actors' reactions. We do not have much to do with today's films. <br /> <br />
