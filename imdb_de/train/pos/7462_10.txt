Note: These comments are for people who have watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and exciting movie that explores existentially what the tag line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the film action for the confused cinema audience may come into focus, if you look at it from another angle. <br /> <br /> If I consider the following: <br /> <br /> Now I did not go through the scene scene by scene, so I have to keep investigating my claims (and I welcome your thoughts), but give it a try and see if the movie does not fit: where exactly does the questionable "splice" occur <br /> <br /> Now I'm not talking about the connection as explained by the LE "technician" since this sequence itself could be interpreted as a rationalization within David Aames' mind / dream / coma state, but the true connection between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me the reality In a car crash, the type of exposure (for example, no explosion) is a probable "splice" point, and any particular sequence that is an existential dream / coma / non-reality contains, feels - whether it is shown onscreen before or after the crash - is actually part of Aames' personal journey of self-realization in his own mind. <br /> <br /> So in this regard, we have two questions left (if you know more, let me know): is Aames really disfigured and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you are not in the exact order of details in the Plot list or at what point his dreams are scattered all over, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a person on a journey to yourself find and find yourself This means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
