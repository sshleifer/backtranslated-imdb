Every movie critic and metalhead hated this movie, but I liked it. I saw this on TV somewhere as a child and was amazed at the scene where Sammi comes on stage and plays Fastway's Trick or Treat. <br /> <br /> The film itself was typical of the '80s, the guy is being pushed around by thugs, asking for supernatural help to defeat the thugs, but goes too far and needs to be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt of Melrose Place selects Skippy from Family Ties for Skippy to receive Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him and lose all hellish breaks, culminating in where Tony sings (lip-synching) and dance to a metal song before the Shyt beats the fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and things besides the music and the overall picture was enough to pump my fists 8 out of 10
