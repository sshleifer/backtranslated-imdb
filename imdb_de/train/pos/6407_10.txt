I was in for this movie in a cast and crew show because my friend, the producer of the movie, invited me. Forget what you've seen in the commercials, forget what you've heard, and watch this movie. I was more than surprised. In a world of The Grinch, Charlie's Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, here comes a movie worth your hard earned cash! Gorgeous scenes, wonderful cinema games and a cast that you want to eat with your heart. I found that this was one of the most staged powerhouse films of the year, and with good reason. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar nod. If you could give everyone involved a package as an Oskar, this would be the movie.
