A boy and a girl are being chased by a local warrior because the boy (accidentally) killed the warrior's father (or whoever he was). And they travel through the wildest parts of Africa. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is not that good (apart from this elephant kid). But it is a very good adventure and it is not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten the movie a bit). <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7, because of its image of African nature and it's action.
