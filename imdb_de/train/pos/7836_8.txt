Canto 1: How Kriemhild grieved over Siegfried and how King Attila raged through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild insists on having the head of her beloved husband's murderer, Hagen Tronje, but her brother's king Gunther (Theodor Loos) rejects her request. When King Attila of the Huns courtes Kriemhild through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, she has him sworn by oath on behalf of his king that no man would ever insult her. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake. <br /> <br /> Canto 2: How Kriemhild says farewell to her home and how she was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some earth from which Siegfried died, and travels to the Huns' court, where she is from Attila herself who also promises through oath to defend them. Canto 3: How King Attila besieged Rome and Kriemhild summoned her brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a little boy, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild what she would most like to do. She asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Canto 4: How Kriemhild receives her brothers: Kriemhild insists on having Hagen Tronje's head, but her brothers stick to their friend and again do not accept their request. <br /> <br /> Canto 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelung: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but refuses to follow the laws of the desert, a guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers the Hums Gold for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight, and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Canto 6: The plight of the Nibelung: The Huns lose the fight against the Nibelungen, but besiege them in Attila's castle. Kriemhild promises to save her life, provided they deliver Hagen Tronje, but her brother Gunther says the German people have remained true to his friends. Canto 7: The end of the Nibelungen: After the death of Rüdiger von Bechlarn, Giselher, Gisherher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally taken prisoner. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje and ends her revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the poetic legend of Siegfried by "Kriemhild's Revenge" is also told through seven dramatic songs. The nature of the first part is a great story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal. The second part is a dramatic story of hate, revenge and loyalty. The solid script with a perfect character development, the outstanding performance of the cast and the great direction of Fritz Lang have produced another epic event. Margarete Schön impresses with a completely different woman who is obsessed and inflexible in her revenge desire. The costumes Kriemhild wears are also very impressive, and her acting is based on her face and looks. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction to the death of his only son because I found it too passive. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos ??
