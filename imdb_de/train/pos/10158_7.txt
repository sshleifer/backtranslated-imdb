Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, a traditional rendition of gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real sense of what Jesus' world looked like (I was already there) and June passionately enters the role of Mary Magdalene. Cash's story is good too. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was a failure. 2. There is no benefit to the story of how Cash uses some of his faith-based music. 3. Since there is no success, I doubt that we will ever see this widespread again. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, United States
