I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I can not remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feeling that triggered Gilley's and the mechanical cop of Johnny Lee's hit "Lookin 'for Love," which still evokes memories of childhood when I hear them. I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and All I can say is, I was totally excited. Only a few films have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's Ranch House, the Texas City Chemical Factory, Gilley's Dance Hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe that's why it does not have much of a charm. But no matter how you feel about country music (I can not stand it despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American pie. That's why I love it!
