The French and Belgians do what they do best. It's quirky, visually imaginative, exciting, and emotionally challenging storytelling. Director Jaco van Dormael leads us into the world of Georges, a Down Syndrome sufferer, and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone. This is not done in a patronizing way, but with a lot of fun and honesty. George's interplay with George's management guru is a mind-boggling treatment of Harry - moving with breathtaking ease from comedy to tragedy back to comedy. <br/> <br /> Eighth Day is well and truly overshadowing similar Hollywood dishes such as Barry Levinson's Oscar winner Rain Man or Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. Sometimes it reminds of the humor of Milos Formans One flew over the cuckoo's nest, overshadowing Dennis Potter. <br /> <br /> As the emotionally jaded and desperately lonely yuppie Harry, Daniel Auteuil enters another sublime performance. But it's the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a movie with consistently strong performances and so many memorable phrases-the shoe business scene, the dealership scene, Georges's dance to Genesis's "Jesus He Knows Me," the conference scene, the fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. Just rent it or visit a show at a retro cinema near you and see what you have missed. Better still, buy this movie. Just awesome .....
