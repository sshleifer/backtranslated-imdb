I saw this movie when Mystery Science Theater directed it in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Really so bad that this movie has to be scored by sheer freakinesss ten to be seen, to be believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this script for children should be beaten. I really mean the devil against Santa Claus? Visions of hell? Creepy laughing reindeer? Forced labor with racist stereotypes? It's not the Sesame Street, that's for sure. Crow calls out during the MST3K show, "This is a good old-fashioned nightmare fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are many strange allusions and screwed up theology. Merlin (presumably the Arthurian Merlin) hangs with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (d. H. The Sky). Santa talks about the baby Jesus and sends "Mr. Stork" letters to children asking about siblings. There are symbols around the castle that look like either pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have seen it every year since 1993, and we subject everyone we can hold for 2 hours to see it with us.
