I have a girlfriend who is just getting into a relationship with a SOB that has a longtime girlfriend. Of course, the SOB is very handsome, charming, etc., and my girlfriend is a very smart woman. Seeing Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is like watching what's going on in real life, when such guys are destroying our girlfriends' lives. It is tragic and you know that in the end it will hurt a lot, but there is nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty While he is empty, he pulls the faces and tells the stories, which he assumes that they get the desired reaction. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Leaud and Lebrun have loved two hours, and the next morning he puts a record and sing along sweetly and charmingly to amuse them, is brilliant. The phrase "What the hell am I doing with this idiot" flickering over her face will be remembered for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but see it all at once, preferably in a movie theater. It takes a while to get in, but then time disappears.
