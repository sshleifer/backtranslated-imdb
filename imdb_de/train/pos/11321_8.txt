When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh no, it's as cheesy as Elven's song and not even so damned!". And indeed the setup is almost identical, the single boy lives alone in a big house and suddenly gets involved in a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls live with him. <br /> <br /> But the here stops the similarity. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as that in Inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very small. The magical setup is a bit crazy because it's seven people, with seven servants fighting for the Holy Grail. All servants are someone who is famous. Half of all masters come from the same school, rules for engagement, etc. However, this will soon happen dimming and fading from the beauty of the drawing and the script. <br /> <br /> I actually saw all 24 episodes in one day and without comparing them to animes that I liked more, but from other genres I have to say that I was very happy.
