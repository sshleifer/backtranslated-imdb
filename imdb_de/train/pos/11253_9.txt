This is an extremely long film, which means that you can get bored before it gets interesting, but its length offers the characters the opportunity to find lasting bonds in your sympathies. You will find it particularly disgusting, because it's a story, who finds heroes among the bad and the weak. If you love a monster, scream for Magnus Pym, the spy who cheats everyone - especially his country, his friends and his family - a man who has always been manipulated and shaped by the same people. <br /> <There is no really sympathetic character throughout the story, no loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize with. But to see this without the help of a handkerchief would be remarkable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it in the end. It's worth it for people who like coughing movies about low human character.
