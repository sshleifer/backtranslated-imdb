A great movie. Acting - from the doctor to the street artist to the main prostitute - was wonderful with very few exceptions; I thought Soni Razdan (Ms. Noble) and Vrajesh Hirjee (Saurabh) were the best of the lesser known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who is possibly accused of exaggeration, presented a thoroughly credible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work - and the way she captured the energy of Bombay streets. The tranquility of Gustad, who speaks his prayers and his life in the tiny dwellings. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall, which becomes a shrine and then is broken - and the philosophical views of the artists. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian topics.
