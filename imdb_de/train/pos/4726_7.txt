The origin of this movie is a mystery to me, as I only know as much as IMDB before leasing it. I assume that "Killshot" before "Starship Troopers" was one of the countless pilots who never managed to network, cable or otherwise reach. The new title of "Kill Shot" is hilariously thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick hints that this was not intended for the cinema. The fast cuts, the cheesy Melrose-Place music and the short 2 second close-ups of the lead actor let you know what you feel like. <br /> <br /> And that does not matter to me. I rented this movie when I saw the wrapper laying Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards in front of a volleyball net on the cover. I think it would be fun to see her in a movie alongside the Starship Troopers sci-fi travesty (in my opinion an excellent book), not a hot movie - but that's another review). After looking it up in the IMDB, my roommate and I suspected that the pilot was pulled up after the apparent success of Trooper's and Richard's own career (see Bond Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene with a minor character to achieve the coveted R-Rated status - that was desirable in the suspenseful video rental sections. In any case, you should not have rated it if you want to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's entertaining. I hate spoiling the fun of telling you it's a TV pilot. That was the biggest draw when watching - if you expect a movie and get a TV show, the differences between them are more apparent than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I rent it again? Would I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts to make all demographics would have done well in the mid-90s. Token black guy (who is gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating), Asian (Japanese, I suppose, the name koji) symbolizes more of science and computer than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina student has everything for her except the bank account of her family - this show would probably have done OK. <br /> <br /> But as a movie, it just tears me. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to do. It made for a very nice evening, and that's all I ask of rentals.
