Here is another movie that does not really need a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining, and of course it's ultimately inspired by a successful television series that many say is even better (I personally like both). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to get used to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were on the TV show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the other way around) weaning found. But in both cases we have four good actors who, in real life, are so much like their fellow bandmates that they've managed to make those characterizations their own. It is the humorous material of Neil Simon, from which comes laughter. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy freak (Lemmon) thrown up by his long-lived wife from a 12-year marriage settles in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and completely irresponsible buddy (Matthau). If these two unlikely roommates are put together in the same four walls, this can lead to extremely weird problems.
