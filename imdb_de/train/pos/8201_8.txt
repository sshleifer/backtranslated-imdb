Sudden Impact is considered Eastwood's artistic failure at a time in his career when he earned a reputation as a director. The reason is not actually the film itself, but the attitude towards vigilantism that it seems to support. In some places, the death wish is actually more guilty than the original Dirty Harry movie. You could argue if this is a movie about guilt, justice and retribution at the end of the day. At the end of the day, it is more compassion for me than compassion. However, given all these arguments, it is easily overlooked that the sudden impact is a very well-made film. Forget the "Let's go punk, make my day scene" iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco from the air and zoom in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or take a look at the brilliant scene in which Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood takes advantage of the juxtaposition of faces. All in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was the first time Eastwood brought it to the screen, albeit in an action film with questionable ideology. I also think this is the first movie Eastwood has made at a good pace. Although Eastwood has a tremendous talent as a director, the dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see "Misty play" for me, "Breezy", etc.). The only thing that really annoys is the farting dog.
