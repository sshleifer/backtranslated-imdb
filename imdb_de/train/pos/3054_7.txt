"Panic" is a kind of crime comedy starring William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people. At the moment, however, he is facing a depression and therefore he sees a therapist. There he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to give up the family business (the murders), but he does not know how to tell his father this midlife crisis, faced with the regular problems: getting into a pretty young girl and everything This includes falling in love. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this movie and it was a good movie, but it does not fully deliver. The story was rather flat and clich√©d. <br /> <br /> 7/10
