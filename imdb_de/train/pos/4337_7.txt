I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much obscenity for no reason. Maybe that's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, many bad words with bathroom humor? I thought better of him and think less about him for this movie. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and a few moments of humor, as well as some potentially important issues, have made me rate him so highly. > <br /> This could be a great movie for adult kids to laugh about their own people and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration for the families of the audience seriously harms what a family movie could have been, but fails. Certainly not worth spending money on, although it might be worth watching for free on television.
