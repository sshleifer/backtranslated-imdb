I do not know if this is a sitcom or not, but I agree that this is one of the greatest TV shows ever. It's great that this show is still aired. And I love Michelle. It's cute in the episodes when she was a baby and she talked, and sometimes she said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show may relate to children and adolescents. Well, families struggling through hard times and trying to work it out as a family. I do not know who would ever decline an opportunity to see this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode, when I think her name is DD. That was a great episode. An example of how this TV show shows how the family works as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show for everyone.
