This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (the movie by Tim Burton). But it's less glamorous and more in your face. And of course it's not the father, but his grandfather telling the stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the movie is also moving back and forth (so the tale of the story here at IMDb could tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie). It's funny and captivating enough, even as you move from one story to another and have some dramatic moments as well. It also surprises you here and there with things that you would not expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you like such movies! :O)
