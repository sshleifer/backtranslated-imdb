Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity about insects and cinema blends into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beetle. The pretty simple story of an adulterous couple, both looking for stimulation outside of their marriage, resembles a biographer or vitagraph. Starewicz has opted for the story of using embedded beetles with wires that straighten the legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story begins when Mr. Beetle is unknowingly caught in front of the camera by a jealous locust with a dragonfly from the local nightclub. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, he pursues her angrily, forgives her and takes her to watch a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle soon finds out about her husband's infidels, as the movie they see is the jealous grasshopper shots of Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. Mrs. Beetle beats up Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, and both land in jail after the projector they destroy catches fire. The insects are housed in humanized environments such as a house or disco and have human characteristics such as jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. The insect figures carry briefcases, drive motor vehicles and even wear shoes, but they also shake their antennae and open and close their jaws like real insects. The novelty of the story does not wear off even after multiple consideration, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly. Action happens with intricate details, but speed and faster shooting are lost. Despite its pace, the film is a prime example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended.
