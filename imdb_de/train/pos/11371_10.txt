This is a really remarkable piece of cinematic performance. From the beginning I was really excited about the (real) story, as Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cries as he performs the autopsies on the remains of the child's body. This is the captivating story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the onlooker almost begins to pity him until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow Alexandr Bukhanovsky was absolutely credible in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union is all too clear Joss Ackland through the behavior of Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by him. For me, the outstanding performance of Donald Sutherland proved once again what a great character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts the silence of the lambs in the shade, from the atmospheric and dreary landscape of the Soviet Union to the performances of the superlatives of all participants. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie at 10/10
