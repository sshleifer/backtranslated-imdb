What can I say, I grew up with Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Films are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and common family, which is loving and great. Vivah is a journey for a couple arranging a marriage that arranges and loves marriage. Shahid did a good job. Anupamji as always awesome. Amrita Rao was different, although I felt that the other person did not suit me. We saw them in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras and Main ho on Na. So abandon other role that she is not in. She was excellent at Na and ishk vishk in Main ho, but she might have been able to invest a bit more in the role. Nevertheless a great work by Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but still a genius story that is original. Soraj's films have been brilliant, so we always expect something different from him. Great work of all crew of the crew and all. Beautiful family movie that you can enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and lovers. I give 10 out of 10 points.
