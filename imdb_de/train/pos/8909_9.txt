This is a pretty well-known one, so I do not get too deep into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who learn about a slimy alien lump that comes down to earth via meteorites. Human contact with this slime ball burns like acid through the flesh. It also absorbs human body, which makes it bigger. No one believes the teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems the blob can not be stopped. It's done really well for his age and unlike many other 50s, the pace is pretty fast. The story is unique and a must for any fan of old science fiction and monster movies. If you can dig up the gooey gore of the '80s horror, you should also check out the '88 remake.
