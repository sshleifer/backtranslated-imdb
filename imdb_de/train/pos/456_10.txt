This is a nice movie that restores the mind. From the use of the villa, which inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s, to the inspired casting, every choice was absolutely right! The silent enjoyment of this movie does not become obsolete after repeated visits. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these roles! I would love Enchanted April on widescreen DVD.
