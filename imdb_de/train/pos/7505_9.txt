If there's a genre I've never been a fan of then it's the biopic. Always misleading, full of false information, overly dramatic scenes and tricks all around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of really talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great deal of harm to the people they want to capture on the screen. Skeptism takes the place of hype, with the majority of biopics going on the big screen, and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers rejected Gretchen Mol in the face of Bettie Page's role, saying she was no longer a celebrity and had no chance for the role. I never doubted that Mol could handle the role since then, but I never expected her to be as pale as I had seen hours ago. Mol is a true Oscar-worthy performer, for the legendary pin-up girl of the '50s who, after an early life of abuse (subtly portrayed and tastefully presented, which would probably do few directors), is one of the most talked about Models of all time will be. The picture covers a lot in its 90-minute runtime. Despite three subplots there is still the feeling that a small part is missing in the story. Director / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turners fantastic script is clouded only by a too abrupt and not so clear ending, as it should. Nevertheless, the two ladies must be recognized for having created a near-faultless biopic that manages to pay homage to both its subject and the decade he masterfully emulates. At the Oscars, Mol, Turner and Harron were to receive nominations. Doubt that it will happen, although there are certainly not three women who earn more of them. 9.10
