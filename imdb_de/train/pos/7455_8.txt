Goldeneye is always referred to as one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about that. This game, though very different, could well be the modern Bond champion of its time. <br /> <br /> This was not a Bond game based on material from another medium. That was a completely new one. Script game. That even had its own title song! (Without this bond it would not be binding, haha!) The gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of Bond games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most games, these The performers portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictitious creations for the game. What is the cinematic feeling? With a highly "storable" storyline, you feel as much at stake as you lose in a movie. <br /> <br /> Pleasant in every way, from start to finish. Even after the game, there is still much to do. With the leaderboard system and unlockable features to be achieved, and its multi-player missions, this is an outstanding game. Although I'm quite old, in video game years. It is still a good game that you can record and play whenever you feel the need to get some more bond in your life. Even now, just thinking about it, I've stuck the title song in my head. Such a great cast and well written plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on screen, almost as if the performers were in front of you, and it's as entertaining as the game itself. Excellently done, in real bondmode. This can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to throw this game now. If you have not played it yet, do not miss it!
