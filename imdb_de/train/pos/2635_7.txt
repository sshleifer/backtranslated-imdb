My Take: A fun version of THE LION KING posing as a sequel. Surprisingly amusing. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another hilarious video worth a theater performance. I can not understand why Disney released it directly as a video and theatrically publish shameful movies like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". These films are better to see in the video stores (in the area of ​​"new releases") than to see their theatrical posters in front of the cinemas. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a parody of the first movie (though the events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaas (voiced by Ernie Sabella). We see how they make fun of the events of the first movie. Original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their vocal roles in the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller as Timon's mother and grumpy uncle offer a comical relief /> <br / > So that does not sound funny. Maybe not now, but look at it yourself. The fact that his actions are not so serious makes it all the more enjoyable. It's a bit like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
