... intimate and specific. Yes, a bit of a Cinderella story, but only after many winding turns does it get deeper into Antwone's psyche. Only superficial consideration can condemn this film as superficial. This is the stuff that heals nations, this is one of our great national stories. Antwone's path to emotional health includes a whole series of family stories, the history of slavery and its consequences. I hope that Denzel Washington once again confirmed in his first directorial work that he has a really beautiful mind and soul.
