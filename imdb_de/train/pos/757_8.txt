I have to be honest. I saw and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, funny and slippery. Yes, there is a lot of humor for every taste. If you're interested in the kind of humor that comes with making fun of people who fall off skateboards, then you'll have a great time. <br /> <br /> Or if you have fun with extreme stunt actions bad, you'll also have a great time. And if you like skatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I like all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. I like to laugh with the situations of the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, try extreme stupidity on this show. With all respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or maxed out. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys need a psychologist. Especially the Paco character.
