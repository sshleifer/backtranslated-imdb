As drunk millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the role of Moore fit so perfectly that he also restricted him as an actor. There were soon many disappointments (including the pale continuation of this film), but this does not diminish the charm or attraction of this image, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are shaky, but the cast plays with so much enjoyment that it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gielgud a sly, dry-amusing role as Arthard's Valet Hobson; His relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a wondrous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as a love interest for workers) is naughty in an unobtrusive and Moore is sassy but deft and vivacious; he has never shaken off the shadow of Arthur, but at least we appreciate this document of a career peak. *** from ****
