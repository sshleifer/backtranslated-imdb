I visited Camp Chesapeake. It was at the head of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar summer camp with cabins. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became Junior, Senior Counselor and later Waterfront Director. If the camp had continued, I would have done anything to become a warehouse manager. Unfortunately, the powers of the YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp a few years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of MD and the natural destruction by Mother Nature. The 350 hectare site offered so many opportunities to use the contact with the nature offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and property managers. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I worshiped every one of his beings. Although he could not swim, he was an Aquarius. If I asked him where the fish would bite, he would designate the spot and I would have a ball. At the end of the summer there was also a family camp. These memories will be with me for eternity.
