I would like to add the praise for the production of this film, especially the brilliant cinematography. The sparkling fire of smooth and muscular skin produces stunningly beautiful images. The film was nominated (and won) for a single Oscar - the first to be awarded for editing. Mala's performance is moody, penetrating and powerful.
