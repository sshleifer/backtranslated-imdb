The Enterprise pilot has been missing one thing since the original Star Trek: a serving of realistic, flawed personalities. The utopian characters of the Next Generation became tiring, they were so noble that they were incredible. I also like the sign that humans are bitter towards the volcanoes. It's funny to see them as presumptuous snobs. I'm looking forward to seeing people become the dominant race between the two, though I do not think it would work in the timeframe of the show. The only negatives I've noticed have been the "2 Hour Fast Ending" which is common on many trek shows. The second was the shameless search for reviews through a few pointless sexy scenes. It was inappropriate for a good science-fiction show to be able to stand on its own without trying to fill the youthful audience with some skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so yeah. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode works.
