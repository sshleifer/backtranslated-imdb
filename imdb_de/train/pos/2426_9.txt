"Once in the life" is a very good movie. However, it is not good for everyone as the language is vulgar and some situations are violent. The film manages to portray "life" in New York's districts where drug issues are important in an anecdotal, believable way. This depiction, in turn, is used to decorate a highly thoughtful and exciting drama that is supported by powerful dialogues (though I've had difficulty understanding some of them because English is not my native language - it's fine on video). There is sometimes a small overplay, but I think it goes well with the general orientation that Fishburne has given the movie. This gives the thing more to think about than just a good style exercise, especially in time / action management. The characters, though not easy, are easy to understand and the actors do a good job of embodying them. Incidentally, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not too proud, you should watch the movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie with 9/10.
