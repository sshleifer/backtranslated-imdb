This peculiarity of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his discretion was at the time he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He's obsessed with figuring out what brought her to the point where he dresses in drag and dressing, and reflects events as they may have evolved. The film is troubling to a certain extent and there is an atmosphere of eerie fear in which Polanski stands out, but it comes too much as a reissue of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other better Polanski films that come along to deal with the eerie events in atmospheric apartments. <br /> <br /> But as far as employment is concerned ... If I do not read too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's response to the feelings of persecution against which he felt he was sexually perverted and banished from America. No assessment of him in one way or another, but it's hard to dispute the evidence in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
