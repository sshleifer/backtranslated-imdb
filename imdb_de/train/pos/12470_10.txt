I have just watched this movie on TV. <br /> <br /> I lost my dad when I was young, and this film has certainly touched me. <br /> <br /> I can feel it lost the little girl Desi felt the feeling of wanting to see her father again. <br /> <br /> wanted to talk to him. <br /> <br /> or at least the chance to say goodbye. <br /> <br /> and I am so touched by the letter written back to her. <br /> <br /> said her father had read her letter and sent it back to someone to answer her and buy her a gift because there is no shop in heaven. <br /> <br /> It just makes me feel that miracles exist.
