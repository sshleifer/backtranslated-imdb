I saw this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I only vaguely remember. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the theme song. In addition, all were ideally staffed. The writing was very strong too. The services were also first class. I hope a network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I summarize, I would like to say that I will always remember this show, even though I do not think I have seen every episode. Well, in the end, if a network ever returns it, I hope you catch it one day before it finally blows up.
