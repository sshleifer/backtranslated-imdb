Forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget that it is obsolete in many ways. Instead, give deserved merit to author and director Ida Lupino if you've dealt with a topic that was taboo in Hollywood at the time (1950). As far as I know, this was the first film to deal with the topic of rape and the emotional and emotional impact of the crime on its victims. <br /> <br /> Even though the actor's acting is at best pedestrian, Mala Powers, who was eighteen or nineteen at the time, is a terrific achievement as the traumatized young woman Ann flees from her "shame." want. Because of her work in this film, I'm surprised she did not have a more successful acting career. Even Death Andrews has some nice moments, as the minister who wants to help her, Ms. Lupino, who obviously works on a limited budget, could still create some memorable scenes like the persecution, the streets and lanes leading to the rape, and the following police reports. And she created a bittersweet ending that asked me if Ann could ever live a normal life again.
