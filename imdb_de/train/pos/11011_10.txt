Bombardier, a major moneymaker for RKO Radio, plays Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as coaches at a school for bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods while their students fight for the affection of Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods prove the sound during a bombing raid on Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured by the Japanese and tortured, but the mortally wounded Scott can set a gas forklift on fire, which is a perfect target for his fellow bombardier. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war movies, with moments of subtle conciseness (the death of apprentice Eddie Albert), scenes of ridiculous "Yellow Peril" melodrama (the Japanese hiss through their teeth while torturing the helpless Americans). Although it no longer seems timely today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda action (the film is sometimes mistakenly listed as the debut of Robert Ryan, who has actually appeared in front of the cameras since 1940). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in a copy of this film, please contact me: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
