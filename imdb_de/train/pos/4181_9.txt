It has been so long since I saw this movie (at least 15 years old), and yet I still have a vivid picture of the terrible consequences prisoners of war may have despite the provisions of the Geneva Convention. "A unit of Australian experts for underwater destruction is captured in an archipelago near Japan after successfully setting mines in a Japanese port. Once in jail, these men expect the same treatment as any other prisoner of war, but to their dismay, they are soon told by a friendly Japanese jailer that they are being tried as spies, since they did not have a uniform when they were imprisoned. The consequences of such a violation according to the Japanese Law on Combat are executions by beheading. Despite their pleas and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guards, the day of reckoning is approaching like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high that you'll actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest with the percussion of a marching execution squad writing it here. But I can promise you that you will never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the US
