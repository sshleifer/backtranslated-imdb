The wild but naive, big Joe Buck leaves home in Big Spring, Texas, and hurries to the Big Apple looking for women and lots of money. In New York, JB meets frustration and "Ratso" Rizzo, an unkempt but heartfelt cheater. Somehow, these mismatched couples manage to survive each other, which in turn helps them cope with a sombre, sometimes brutal, urban America on the road to a poignant end. <br /> <br /> Both funny and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" rides right into the maelstrom of cyclical cultural change, confirming to the viewers of 1969 that they themselves have been swept away from the Age of Innocence of the fifties and Dorothy and Toto were moved to the age of 60's Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is masterful. the casting is perfect; the acting is first class; the script is crisp and convincing; the cinematography is captivating; and the music improves all that up. He rightly won the best Oscar of the year in 1969, and I would count him as one of the best films of this cyclonic decade.
