Orson Welles manages to beat my ass with every one of his pictures I see. Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as his other masterpieces The Magnificent Amber, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at midnight. The plot can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it seems to move a bit too fast (about an hour was cut out when the test screenings turned out bad). It does not matter though. You can not see Welles' films and concentrate on the plot. His direction determines what a great direction is. Almost every scene in this movie can compete with any other scene he directed. Look at the court scene. Usually these are scenes that I can not stand. For example, try to end Welles's own speech at the end of the compulsion. Pay attention to the detail accuracy of this court scene in Lady from Shanghai. Watch the jury constantly sneezing and interrupting the proceedings. Or just take a look at the lighting in this scene. I know it's just a simple blind, which has been used in noir movies and crime thrillers of the time, but Welles gives it its own beauty. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the ability, an ability no one else seemed to have, to make a thriller that contained examples of the greatest poems. Whether he spoke Shakespeare or spit hard-boiled lines, he had the power to touch the soul. 10/10.
