I show this film university students in language and media law, because the lessons are timeless: Why it is important to speak out against injustice, and can bring about the changes desired by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and opinion are essential for democracy. This story must have seen how apartheid was brought to the world through the activism of Steven Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods. There is also an important lesson of free speech: "You can blow out a candle, but you can not blow out a fire, and once the flame starts to catch, the wind will make it beat faster." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel to Shaking the Tree).
