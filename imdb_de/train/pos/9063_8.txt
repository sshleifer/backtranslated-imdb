It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater that is occupied by parents and their exuberant children. I had the feeling that instead of a movie ticket I should have received a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> Based on Thomas Rockwell's respected book, How To Eat Fried Worms begins like any child's story: moving to a new city. The new kid, fifth grader Billy Forrester, was once popular but needs to start all over again. Finding friends is never easy, especially if the only one interested is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who is a giant at 4 1/2 feet. <br /> <br /> Further complications is Joe, the tyrant. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting. He fights children with the death ring: a crackerjack ring that is said to kill you if hit. But not immediately No, the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in eighth grade. Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays it cool and vows that he eats worms all the time. Then he throws it in the face of Joe. Ewww! To win her over, Billy reluctantly wants him to eat 10 worms. Roasted, cooked, marinated in spicy sauce, crushed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is given an exotic name, such as "Radioactive Slime Delight," in which the children finally live their dream to heat a living organism in the microwave. <br /> <br /> If you've ever met me, you know that I have an uncontrollably hearty laugh. I felt like a creeper erupting with a toddler who has to moan that his "dick dick" hurts. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Like a Garrated Farrelly Brothers movie, he is both upset and adorable. <br /> <br /> The author / director Bob Dolman is also an accomplished storyteller. To increase the stakes, the worms must be used up by 19 clock. Besides, Billy has a dark secret: he has an extremely sensitive stomach. Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such precision he resorts to the insecurity of children and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. If you were to exaggerate this movie the way children do their dilemmas, you'll find that it's essentially about war. Freedom fighters and freedom-makers use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy warfare just to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn a thing or two about peacekeeping from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was comforted when two pursuing mothers behind me looked confused and agreed, "This was a great movie." Great, now I do not have to register in a legal database.
