I'm Italian, and when I recently watched this movie again, I was astonished at its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, today I can appreciate it with the minds and feelings of adults , Now I can understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), which at that time no longer existed. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood epics are good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' did not have an English version because it's not funny enough ... not for popcorn and cola audiences. Suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections. In Italy recently a very good DVD version was released: INTEGRAL with excellent colors. You can find it in some file shares, but it is only Italian and without subtitles. Too bad, the dialogue and the voices of this film are remarkable.
