I have always imagined this movie from the video cover. At some point it came to the purchase for a fiver in a sale and a boy for a movie. A simply stunning performance from all the cases and it's filmed so beautifully. Even from a distance, one can hardly hear what the dialogue is, as if one were really so far away and picking up parts of the story. It is really moving, often amusing and very good to watch. Not much dialogue, but filmed so that you feel so much. A 9/10 of me. Something you must have seen.
