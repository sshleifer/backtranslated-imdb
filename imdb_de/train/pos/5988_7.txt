This film from 1939 tried to use the much better movie "Angels with Dirty Faces" by Michael Curtiz. The only interesting thing about Ray Enright is how tamed these children were compared to what's going on today with teenagers in American inner cities. <br /> <br /> The film is only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they fit together well. The dead-end kids have bigger parts because the action is more focused on them than on the older ones. <br /> <br /> In a way, it's strange how the arson was used in the same way that some conscientious landlords did here in New York in later years. This was the quickest way to turn a property around without paying attention to the social issues it caused. In today's climate with so many guns, there is a new reality. The young children of the story seemed more like pranks than criminals. How are the times changing?
