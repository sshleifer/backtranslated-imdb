I received a tour of Cracker Bag last night before previewing Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided it, but I'm so glad they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early '80s, as seen through a child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were funny and like the rest of the movie so alive. Each shot brought with it a great sense of nostalgia, as it reminded me of my own childhood (since he is the same age as the director is likely to help a little) and the sound multiplied the feeling. I just hope that I can see Cracker Bag again someday.
