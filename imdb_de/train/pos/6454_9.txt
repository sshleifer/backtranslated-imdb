I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005 and of the 14 films I've seen there, I would rate this movie # 3. At first, I had an interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself, with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where it was filmed. I also grew up in an area in the rural north of the American forest, where many small towns were very similar to the backdrop of this film. It's nice to see more films that use rural areas as scenes like s√• som i sky. This was a very good movie, and I'm sure it's a very tough movie to work with its big ensemble, but director Kay Pollock has rejected the movie after nearly two decades away from directing. Helen Sjoholm was a fantastic actress on her movie debut as an actress and I would be happy to see more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist at the head of this rounded cast. I would highly recommend this movie and rate a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
