I love these "diaper baby" movies! You could not shoot a movie like this today and it's rich in movie history. It's stupid and the movie was made to make you laugh what he does. I will never know how they ever got these children to "act". I think they are valuable and the kids make me laugh, but the others who made this film also show the naivety of the early '30s. Bear in mind that the film industry was very young, the stock market collapsed, the global depression began, and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could watch movies for five cents is out of my mind, but so is the dinner for 25 cents. It was another time with a completely different way of thinking.
