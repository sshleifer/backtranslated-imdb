If you like the subtle (yes, I mean subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy, you can not help liking this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The unobserved (and uninformed) observer always saw Candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But if he got the chance, he could be really sharp and pretty subtle. It is too bad that he was played in so many roles that he only showed his broad side, because we will never see any more of the others. Oh yes, the movie. You can watch "Going Berserk" over and over again (I know, I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". It's just so good. The plot is a bit confused, but quite deep for such a farce. This will allow Candy and the ever-underrated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to jump off Candy ... and they'll bounce off hard. Definitely worth a look for anyone who likes SCTV or Candy's other work.
