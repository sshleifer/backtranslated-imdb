No movie for everyone, but this movie is one of my top 10. I'm a lover of black comedy. With a cast including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) in the lead roles, the lines can not be anything but dry. The supporting cast is almost dead. The small flaws in the movie include: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her face a washed-out look. There were some little cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor that did no purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screen was too short. All in all, the cast was just incredible with no egos destroying a good script. If you've seen the movie Underworld (a dark criminal movie) by Larry Bishop (writer, director), you'll enjoy this movie. His next outing (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
