I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger when this woman (Sarah) was initially scared as she slipped. I thought that was a terrible scene, because I would think, when you see that, the nerves in your body come to you. You get scared and your heart beats faster. I liked Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he'll be known as Rambo and Rocky.
