I appreciate every single frame of this beautiful movie. These are normal people, people we all know, who suffer a bit in their lives and need to carry some luggage with them. Like us all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker bring life to their depictions and are all excellent, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. They would swear that he really is a trucker who drinks so he does not have to feel anything. Baker as his angry sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in a scene, it seems like she's never had flowers before, and probably not. Very worthwhile
