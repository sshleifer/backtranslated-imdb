Rod Serling, of course, was a genius, and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the time he lived in and examples of television in this state of development. Currently, there are no such shows, but rather "Housewife" fans like Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pathetic stings of humor and funny banter that scatter our high-tech screens. Jack Elam rushed into the episode with such dramatic precision and usual craziness that I can not help believing that Rod Serling cut the long-running show for Elam, even though it was a by-product of the flow of the story. This episode ends, as usual, with a twist, but shock and humor are especially mingled with the "serlingesque" skill. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
