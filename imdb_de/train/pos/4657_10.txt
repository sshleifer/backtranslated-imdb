Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. An entertaining, unconventional story of the wonderful achievements of four of the best professionals ever to work in the industry. Peter Ustinov is as brilliant as ever and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time - is a real pleasure. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are also perfect. If you want a movie with perfect casting, this is the thing. What's so impressive is the way these people work against each other in such a natural and effortless way, resulting in a lot of laughs and fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography, and editing are also first-rate, and it's a great time capsule of London in the '60s. It's definitely on my list of all favorites.
