This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to outperform the performance he has given in this film. Duchovny was first class, as were Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour through historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars of all time, the Lincoln Continental of the 1960s. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He wants his wives not to swear or smoke and wear PHE clothes. Duchovny and Forbes are an artist couple from the city, while Early and Lewis are trailer parkers from rural outskirts. Even though the majority tone in the movie is dark, there are many funny scenes. Writing, directing and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everyone delivers, and you want more when the credits roll. One of my favorites of all time. "Hey ... shave this dog and teach him the hunt!"
