Mendez and Marichal have provided us with a serious, compelling and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis triggered by 108-year colonialism in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have ever met, and because our nation does not have to face its imperial responsibilities, the Puerto Ricans can wither and die. The spiritual crisis of the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created when families are undermined and the basic institutions that sustain each society. Corruption is widespread to the extent that people are not paying taxes (which has led to a budget crisis for that nation) and a sense of cynicism and mistrust permeates the island's culture. Fortunately, a donation allowed this painful yet a strong movie to be produced. <br /> <br /> A must. , ,
