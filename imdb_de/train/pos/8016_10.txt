Do not look at these movies as another children's movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a weird mix of a movie because it seems to contain a movie, but in the end it makes a lot of sense (unlike modern movies!). It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent action, good characters) - well, the Muppets are stars, a list of few celebrities * that would love movies. What's surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it's all making a fun family movie that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * The celebs of the movie are indeed top stars of the day, but there's only one true star in the movie and no one dares to outshine Miss Piggy !!!!
