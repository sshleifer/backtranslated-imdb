Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plainclothes detective who locates a group of villains, from visually original characters like Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These bad guys became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. developed their own version of the Tracy-style villains in caricatures like Daffy Duck). especially the wristwatch communicator), which received a considerable amount of video in this excellent movie. The music was wonderfully done by Danny Elfman and the original Madonna songs were interesting, but they were not the highlight of their careers. It's strange, because when you watch the movie and see the thrilling moments, the movie feels so much like Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound to his plays. <br /> <br /> I love the hard-boiled kid, Pacino is Big Boy Caprice (and this chin!), Madonna's attitude to villainy, and the cinematography and directing were impeccable. This movie was made very professional and features a lot of great actors who were known as big actors before the movie (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke) , The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost as if Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a previous life or something, because he really suited it. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie 8/10 for everything he brought to the cinema and was overlooked (for whatever reason). There were a lot of misconceptions about rating this movie on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were totally original and lively, as well as the style of the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting and everything in this movie. Buy it today. You will not regret it.
