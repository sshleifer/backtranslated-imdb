"Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite films by Sammo Hung. The fat dragon is on this trip richer than in "Condors", but he is no less sure as a director or actor. In fact, he is at the forefront of his form, delivering a devastating, brutal actioner that offers half a dozen amazing sequences and also tells a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities, but they serve as a curious complement to the action, ensuring that viewers do not press the fast-forward between the physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene a fun lightsaber duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammos Pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, weird tone. The fast and furious stick fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a prime example of stunning choreography and sharp, brilliant direction and one of the best ever. The violence of the film slowly escalates, until finally the climax of the showdown comes and we experience some of the most brutal clashes in a Sammo production. The director / actor's attack on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, threatening opponents is a sizzling, physically punishing joy. <br /> <br /> Great on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Great score.
