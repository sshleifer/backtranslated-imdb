This movie is a bit unusual as it has a very narrow plot and the movie itself is shot at a very slow and leisurely pace. Although this makes the film significantly different than the average Grant movie, but still very worth seeing and entertaining. It's like someone says, "Let's just follow Cary and see how he bothers with all the little issues that arise when rehabilitating a house." Considering what a funny actor he is in the movie and the great support he receives from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has pretty modest claims, it makes the most of the material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
