The critics did not like this movie. It bombed in the States and therefore received only a limited number in the UK. What a pity, because it rather represents British than American humor and should have been shown first in the UK. Nicole Kidman looks gorgeous and is an absolutely compelling Russian. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes reminding the viewer of the classic of the 1960s (though it's a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> Sure, it's changing from comedy to black comedy, thriller to adventure, but it's memorable, moving, and a breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster. <br /> <br /> open-minded!
