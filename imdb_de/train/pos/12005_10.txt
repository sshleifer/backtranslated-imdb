This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. As an LDS, I highly recommend this movie as you can better understand the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not filmed with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and life-changing film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by all. I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that we all had a change of heart. In this film, people can really understand how hard life was for the Prophet and how much distress he faced. After watching this movie, there was no dry eye in the room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I saw it. I can only recommend this movie to anyone.
