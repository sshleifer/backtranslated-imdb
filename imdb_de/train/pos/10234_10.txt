<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. If you look at the movie, you might feel that the fight scenes are mediocre, but that does not matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great movie has both !! Lam always strives to differentiate himself from his contemporaries and gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan). However, these are not the carefree comedic incarnations you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys fight with brutal results to the death. What makes the movie even better is that anyone could die anytime, there is no holding back. Too bad that they do not make such films more often.
