This is one of Dev Anand's films that gave great, but different films to Hindi film industries such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is brief (if you ask me what the story is), Plot is simple - a brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies singing from Hare Rama Rabbit Krishna. The film, however, shows some of the significant events that the world experienced in the 1970s. Hippie culture, its subjugation to drugs, freedom, escaping, family and entering into something new like the Eastern religion (which was new to whites). They were handled perfectly. Zeenat did her best and Dev as always was remarkable. Songs are best used in this movie (as opposed to the abuse of songs). They were not spoiled. A perfect example is "Decho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo". Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but that's not the essence of the movie. Overall, Devji, who believes in different films, has successfully shown what he wanted to show here. A must for hippie culture and the beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
