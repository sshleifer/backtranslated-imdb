Remember the beginnings of Pay Per View? I can almost remember the number you had to CALL in order to actually rent the movie on your TV. As a kid, we always wanted to rent Playboy, but that meant calling and hiring someone from PPV. And then you get nervous and you look at four hours of soft core. Well, the reason I'm talking about that is because this movie was also on ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was in the add. I've been on the road in recent years to get all the great movies I've seen as a kid and this was one of them. It is one that is difficult to turn off. All star performers try to make the perfect bank failure, but nothing works out right. There are many parodies that are good, and they must fall into this category. It has enough to do and laughs to keep it up. check it out if you dare!
