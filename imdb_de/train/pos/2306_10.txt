I had never heard of The Man in the Moon until last night on this HDTV channel. You see, my taste is like everyone else's, versatile. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Ing. Strangelove to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir by The Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, Repomann and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is wonderfully made, a gentle, happy and tragic movie, beautifully filmed, in which the actors really live in the moment instead of acting. This sweet story will be in our private library shortly. This beautiful story of life in a much finer time in rural Louisiana literally puts you in the pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It's hard to stay stoic in the final moments of the movie, especially when the young girl reaches the level of her elder sister's heart sears all pain and forgives everything. Instead of ruining the enjoyment or sobbing you with my boring prose, this suggestion will now end up with someone who loves movies that speak to us from the heart. <br /> <br /> If you do not buy another movie, please buy the man in the moon. You will enjoy this moving story over and over again. It is a joy and a jewel, a film that is too rare in this world of hardening hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that Man in the Moon shows are a pleasure to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
