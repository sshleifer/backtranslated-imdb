If the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much prettier and mischievous than their Western counterparts. The storylines of the three "Chinese Ghost" films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the details and colors are such that it is not a big problem. Humor, as always, is an integral part of the film, naturally accompanied by a lot of abuse. For those who have not yet met the "Chinese GhostStory" trilogy, this movie offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre. for those who have another fun in the Chinese spirit world.
