People are too hard for the movie. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "check" it. <br /> <br /> It all comes together when Hackman decides not to press the trigger, but his target is still down. Then the fun begins, as everyone "goes down" around him. <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and all the people who are in any way connected to his assassination, whose life ended abruptly and questionably and you appreciate what is implied in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great interpretation of what might have happened. Although the EXACT plot was not tracked (in hindsight, after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), what is implied is of interest. <br /> <br /> I would like to get a copy of it. Look again. The domino principle is correct in view of what is known today.
