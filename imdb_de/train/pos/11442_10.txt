<br /> <br /> As I am not a poet myself, I can not really convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The effortless movement of Goldsworthy as he transforms the natural beauty into his own work is intriguing. Watch as he holds reeds together in a net that hangs close-up on a tree for a few minutes while talking about his work, and then receives the reward when the camera reaches the great setting. Be amazed by the ease with which he works, and then realize the futility of a light breeze overturning the entire net. The genius of Goldsworthy seems to know no boundaries, as his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature, where his work, though complete in its own domain, is made into a whole.
