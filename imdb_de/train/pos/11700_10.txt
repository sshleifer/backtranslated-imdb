I have read most of the comments on this film. I've seen this movie (and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages. We all enjoyed it and it just made us think about what we already knew when reading and studying the Bible about the rapture and the end times. Nobody got scared or traumatized, as I read in some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I have seen many end-time films like "Tribulation," "Armagedon," and so on, and by far this film is one of the best at presenting biblical truths. It does not have many great special effects like today's movies, but I think it's a good witnessing tool. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed for free on this website www.pollpraise.com. Blessings for everyone.
