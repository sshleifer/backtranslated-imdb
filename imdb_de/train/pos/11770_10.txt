I was hoping that this would be a good fan of Timothy Dalton's James Bond, and although it was not his deserved "3rd Bond Outing", it was a laugh. Belushi did a good job in his part and Dalton squeezed it well but was probably underused. His part liked a lofty version of Jack Nicholson in a few good men. The other Brit was a bit shocking, but overall it was a laugh.
