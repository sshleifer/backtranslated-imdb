As a film, this is hardly a 4, but for movie fans of the 1940s, it is almost a must and a 9 as a variety! I was dressed by Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the colonel responsible for the event. What surprised me was the impressive performance of Doris Day. Outside of Calamity Jane, I have never seen a better song than here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, even if he does not have much time on the screen. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost certain that Humphrey Bogart was performing. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever hits a TV station in your area, be sure to capture the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!
