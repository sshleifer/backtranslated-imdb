Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles are in trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed parents, older friends. Jodie Foster, a kind of mother of the pack, tries to keep everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can not. Slowly everyone grows up and leaves. THIS precise point is, albeit consistently underlined, unfortunately manipulated. Do we really need a long sequence in which Scott Baio has overtaken a car full of rackets on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - even with Baio - in which Foster has a strange monogram about the "pain of illusion". Part of the dialogue is downright slippery, and I was not much interested in later editing in the film, which is awkwardly different from death to marriage. But these are nitpicks in a fundamentally very sensitive story about losing a close bond. And Jody's face in the end speaks volumes. If the spectators are suffocated in the end, the movie deserves it. It does not run after tears or asks for compassion. It shows us an example of friendship and the hope that we understand. *** from ****
