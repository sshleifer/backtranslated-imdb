Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) was just released from his wife because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just does not seem to make it, so he goes to his house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) recently divorced and lives in a bachelorette party. Smoking, playing games, chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise for him. Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in. First of all, it's a battle done in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar to pay on time, but soon Oscar will do for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to move on. They invite a few British birds to join them and find Felix so tender that she and Felix soon start crying and chatting about his family life, which turns Oscar aside. That's it, it explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote "They leave me small notes on my pillow, I've told you 158 times that I can not stand little notes on my pillow." We are all without cornflakes. F.U "It took me three hours to find out if F.U Felix was Hungarian!" Based on a piece by Neil Simon (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatrical feel. Set and the counterpart and look feel pretty playful (for better or for worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the films of Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea, playing the same picky / slob roles but with different names (to avoid licensing issues, I'm sure). <br /> <This movie is like chocolate-dipped strawberries. The chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, the strawberry is sour, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty green ones). These are almost polar opposites, but together the contrasts stand out and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
