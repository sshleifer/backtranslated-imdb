I finally bought a copy of "Show People" and added to my collection. I can not comment more than what the previous viewers said, and the characters, plot, and overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. It is worth seeing the cameo of so many silent M-G-M stars. I like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and gets hit by herself as she starred in the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips, as there is no title card to show what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it has something to do with the effect, "I do not think I like her!" Pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three-quarters of a century in film history. Enjoy!
