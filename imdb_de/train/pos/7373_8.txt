Before the regular comments, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE, that on IMDb a runtime of 94 minutes is listed and the DVD by Wellspring Media in the US runs 88 minutes. Every contribution is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends with very rough lives are on their way for an adventure. What they get involved with is exactly what happened when one of them accidentally shot a girl and they fled on foot into the countryside. Instead of just doing a big chase, the movie gets complicated by the stupid and very childish spike behaving inappropriately and clutching its boombox like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story just because of the character of Spike, but without a bit of frustration in the story, the movie would have been too easy. You'll notice that the more stable character, Heaton, is referred to by Spike as a "big man", as opposed to Spike's attitude and "child out of control" behavior. Honestly, I was also aggravated by Spike's ridiculous deeds, especially the spraying can sniff, but in a desperate situation it is obvious that someone of his mentality has opted for a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep things in check until things even get overboard. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a miracle, and after a while I stopped wondering why the hell he was going to do it I want to get Spike out of jail and due to Glenaan's great achievement Continue friendship. After all, there are many reasons for her running that would be a good idea for Heaton to simply let Spike go and try to save herself. I suspect Heaton felt like a protective elder brother to Spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things get too desperate. <br /> <br /> While some of the cinematographs are indeed artistic, they offer a bit more story to the story than just footage of men running through the wilderness. The beautiful landscapes, the rain and the wide gray sky convey a dark tone that enhances the feeling of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual and the use of the song "This Is Not A Love Song" by Public Image Ltd. and the title of the movie are pretty smart. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is understandable if you are not interested in THIS IS NO LOVE, because it focuses on two opposing personalities who escape another man who is determined to hunt them (played by one) cool, quiet David Bradley). It's not a big-budget action-packed conversation. For the rest of us, who loves to seek something minimal and dramatic, it's worth the time, and it offers some extremely tense moments where you can hold your breath. <br /> <br /> I really like films that have recently come from Scotland, with people like Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I'm also a little thankful for the subtitles on this DVD, as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tense, THIS IS NO LOVE. Very tragic and yet captivating storytelling. <br /> <br />
