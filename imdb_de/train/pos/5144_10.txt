This very strange movie is unsurpassed in the West at the time. With its stormy emotions and web of visions, dreams and amazing images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are more choreographed than dancing as actors. It contains the only dream sequence that I know to resemble a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
