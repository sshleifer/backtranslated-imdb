This ensemble piece about adults returning to the formal summer camp of their youth was a very quiet beginner and pioneer in cinemas in the fall of 1993. I would say that was a shame, but again there are some of the better movies quiet releases that do not get much hype or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who is painful) are well here) is the group of actors that have this Refining roles as people who have grown old with good, bad and funny memories of the past summer. This movie is about the gambit of most pleasurable emotions, and the movie never bangs on the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling, preferring that the viewer himself enters the memories. Being a movie viewer who pervades blunt, outrageous manipulation in movies, I appreciate the author / director Mike Binder's handsome seat in the theatrical film. You may come across it on TV, and I would definitely take a look.
