I have seen this movie and although I somehow knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked it. I would recommend it to other people. There is quite a lot on Lifetime Movie Network. And I think since it's close to Halloween, they could play it more. So be on guard if you are interested. I think Alicia Silverstone played her role very well. I really like her as an actress and a person. She looks so nice and down to earth. Kevin Dillon, he was doing so for me. I'm not trying to beat him or anything, but I think his brother Matt has been able to better show off this bad serial killer. Kevin just seems too cute to me. But I think he did a good job.
