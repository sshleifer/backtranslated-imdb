What another critic called a lack of character development, I call understatement. The film was not overwhelmed with exaggerated explanation or unnecessary background story. Yes, there were many unspeakable stories that we only got a glimpse of, but this was primarily a one-day snapshot of an event that catalyzed the change in all of the characters' lives. Henry Thomas's performance was a truly wonderful study of the power of acting, which aims at reaction rather than action. Good rent.
