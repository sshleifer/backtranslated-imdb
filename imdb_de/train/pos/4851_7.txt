Ghost Train is a beautiful and entertaining movie that is typical of the better British comedy coolers of the 1930's and 40's. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they used to be, but this can be overcome if considered historical or curios, atmospheric, effective and exciting. Great fun for a dark (and stormy) night. Lighten up, remove the critic's hat and enjoy it.
