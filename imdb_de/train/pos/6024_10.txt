I saw ZP when it first hit the market and found it a big disappointment. The script seemed enforced and domed and fake in the 60s. It's politics too direct and ridiculous. And let's be honest, I was still under a love spell called BLOWUP, and I still have not shaken it completely. Now the "love" is twisted with all sorts of nostalgia and well. , , Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time is progressing and the time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher for me. I visit this movie about every ten years and it gets better with age. And ZP is its own "experience" and is really connected to BLOWUP only by its creator, the late, great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was fortunate enough to be absolutely flawless Properly projected in its correct size (immense), the print was restored by an Italian cultural authority that knows a fine piece of art when they see it and knows how important it is to get something beautiful in good condition. To this day, I remember the audience gasp when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a visual shock of a thousand volts, which Antonioni had purposely created to bring us to a new consciousness. And indeed, from this point follows a very different kind of "place". <br /> <br /> What makes me amazing is how this film becomes its own. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time I saw it - the early 80's - I had begun to feel affection for the movie as a whole and especially with Daria and Mark. While these acted like a sly-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet) before the two of them, they now hooked me - especially The Girl - in their persistent slo-motion ality. She took her time. , , Life. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her. <br /> <br /> After the excitement of the theater, Reality's daylight quickly began to erase my newly found "pleasure". The towering, shoulder-hugging, big-haired 80s whispered, "But that's a hippie fantasy - let it go." <br /> <br /> The power of Antonioni's vision had already worked the FIRST in me, as I said. I once answered "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and kept my "love" secret, possessive and jealous , <br /> <br /> But that's what good art lives in you and if you wish, it has its way and "loves" you back: secretive, jealous and possessive. And you get "changed". <br /> <br /> Was thrilled that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a giant screen so that you can really be taken into the constructed environment. But hey, sometimes even looking at the lover in a newspaper photo is no better than no look. <br /> <br /> Today the reality hit ZP has mysteriously withdrawn and been replaced by the weepy antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> It is still too "difficult", too "disturbing", to "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe that's how, with all the good art, it lives. Everything dies around it. <br /> <br /> peace.
