"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets. Wins a place among the great films of its genre and even the cinema world in general, along with other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". This means that it is more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Can this possibly just be a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know it by heart since my early teens (when I was 12 years old). <br /> <br /> It's a family movie that you can appreciate. It's emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. It's one of those films that puts a smile on those who appreciate these kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie has no qualities. It has a well-thought-out story, enjoyable characters, an excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, breathtaking landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Speaking of views, it's not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... all in all a wonder of nature - a true panorama. <br /> <br /> The main characters are nice, well-developed and well-portrayed by their actors. Robert Hays is great as the kind-hearted father Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is as good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventionally the youngest and sweetest brother Jamie (his looks really remind me of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our four-legged friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the faithful, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, stupid, impatient, timid, awkward, witty and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). The coincidence simply can not stand still. Sassy is the epitome of the cat's image: elegant, independent, very self-confident and self-confident, with a typical cat attitude, but with a certain cat charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are by nature great "actors": Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underrated movie, but a classic in itself. The sequel is much worse. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the top 250.
