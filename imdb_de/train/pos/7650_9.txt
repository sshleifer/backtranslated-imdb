Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it's twice as emotional. The story revolves around this one Utah family, and it's the connections between the people in the family that hit the movie. The main character (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, at no point does he make you believe that he is acting on all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me. When the two were in scenes, they cut off their lines and did a fantastic job. Great cast, great movie.
