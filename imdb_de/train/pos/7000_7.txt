When I saw the title for the first time, I already deduced the theme of the film - it was obviously not related to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearean and it was about pounds of meat - taking or giving. Will Smith is a good actor, so serial killers were on the way. It could only be a man who gave them to them, so somehow it had to be guilty. I spoiled it for myself by looking at it and knowing the story before I saw it. The beauty of construction is the way parts of the main character's background are dripped to slowly enlighten the audience who he is and who he is. Why he does what he does. <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult topic simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad. This is not an encouraging requirement if you are hoping for a roller coaster ride - you know it will be uncomfortable. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; It attacks the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire indication that the writing is very detailed and thoughtfully thought through, several meanings and a deeply reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that not only did he give his heart to the girl he loved emotionally and metaphorically, but also physically give it to her as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is foiled by falling in love - which is a complication for a second act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's very slow, but I'm not sure it would have been better to have a smaller timeframe. I did not feel the tension and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe I just ruined that for myself. Despite all this, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably receive.
