The trailer for this film did not do the film justice. And although the film did not know what he really wanted to convey, the first half of the film was a light, romantic comedy, and the second half had a more serious, romantic drama, but the overall impression was much better than I thought being. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it an exciting thriller he never really turned out to be. Kidman, one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie turned out to be a lighter, more sensitive, if a bit bizarre, movie that deserves better. Three out of four stars. 9.5.02.
