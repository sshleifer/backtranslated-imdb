THE TODESKING is not one of my favorite films by Jorg Buttgereit - but still an interesting movie about suicide and its causes and implications. Those looking for a gore festival or NEKROMANTIK-style or SCHRAMM-style exploitation are likely to be disappointed. THE TODESKING is definitely a movie in the "Art House" style, so those who need linear, explainable stories do not have to apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that it's one "Episode" is on each day of the week, which revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide, between scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... <br /> <br /> There are some very well-made and thought provoking scenes. Including the man who spoke with his wife about the "problems" and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of its "power" to me because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS-like band on stage ...). But seriously - this is sometimes nice (the scene that shows different angles of this huge bridge is especially effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene and the names that are shown are from people who actually commit suicide sometimes they are confusing, sometimes stupid (the SHE WOLF OF THE SS rip-off is quite amusing), sometimes shocking (I found the scene where the guy with the girl in the park jumped off the bridge ...) talking about his wife, especially effective) is more of an "experience" than a conversation, as is the case for many of these art films. Still, I found that DER TODESKING was not as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and that it would probably be relatively equally good with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal 'enjoyment level'. Definitely worth a look for any Buttgereit or "art" movie. If you dig up that kind of movie - look at SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the BEST art house / horror movie I've ever seen. 7/10 for THE TODESKING
