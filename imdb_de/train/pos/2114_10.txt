Two martial shop workers in a leather goods shop turn out to be secret sweethearts, under aliases. In this simple idea and in the everyday environment Lubitsch produces a rich carpet of wit, drama, dignity and irony that never fades. Stewart and Sullavan are great as an average couple with real feelings and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own dealings and jokes. Although it is unjustly obscured by Stewart's big 39/40 films (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith), this is easy to achieve and we enjoy a whole range of theatrical subtleties not seen in the other films.
