Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves respect for trying, but he is not one of the big Shakespearers like Olivier and Welles. and he continues to suffer from Kenneth Branagh. This always brilliant Irishman steals the show clean. Olivier recognized this potential in his staging and occupied Iago with someone he knew could put him in the limelight. I have not nearly recognized the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see also the views of Venice.
