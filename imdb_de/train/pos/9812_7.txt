"The big goodbye" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure. In this case, Captain Picard poses as a private investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create a kind of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG, DS 9, and Voyager. After entering the holodeck something goes awry and the characters have to deal with the program in other circumstances, except about playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the possibilities of Star Trek and to enable a kind of genre mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s crime novels, and their on-screen depiction is referred to as Film Noir, which often has the stereotypical anti-hero at its head (see, for example, Chandler's Marlowe Stories or Polanski's classic Chinatown) , Star Trek never focuses on the story (it's usually a simple scenario of how to do it), but it allows the actors to look at their characters differently. These holodeck "games" are often used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this perspective, the stories are never solid (but did Star Trek ever have a technical-scientific aspect, I mean, apart from some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "The big goodbye" features a laid-back Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who barely looked better in a Star Trek episode (at least in the early episodes), and Data also has some great scenes (though I do can hardly believe that the lamp is pulled.) A plug from the wall would have really surprised him, because he had researched at this time and his customs. Wesley continues to turn peaceful trekkies into potential killers (why did not they get him to the holodeck and get rid of the gangsters?), But all this is fun ...
