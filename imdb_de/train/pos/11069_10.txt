"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, expecting another snatch / lock stick; I might expect some time shifts, but not too hard for "me and the boys" to go for a few beers. No cups of tea, no extra coke from the counter, no "keep it running" calls when sipping in the fridge - watch the movie! No laughter except for those who can make you out of the considerable violence (and if your boat floats with it, so be it), but sharp direction, excellent dialogue and great performances by The Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
