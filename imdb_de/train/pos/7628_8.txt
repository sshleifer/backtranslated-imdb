This movie is one of those "WOW!" Movies. Not because it's the best movie ever, but because it surprised me. It was not just a TV movie, but Elvis as well. I can certainly say as many impersonators as there was only one Elvis, but I can also say with certainty that Kurt Russel was almost the right one. It was one of the biggest imitations I have ever seen. He made me believe that it really was him. I learned a lot about Elvis' life when I saw this movie. And did not start the TV part that let you down - it's really a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
