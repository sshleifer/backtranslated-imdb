Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> "The Lion King 1: Hakuna Matata" is a disrespectful reissue of a classic story. What classic story do you ask? Of course, the Lion King! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing Disney never misses, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that this is the case is not a good movie. These are essentially the events of 'The Lion King', as told by Timon and Pumbaa. And that's why you need to know the story of 'The Lion King' by heart to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> On one level, I've been watching this and thinking "Oh my god, that's so lame ..." and on another level I had a ball. Much humor is predictable - I mean, if Pumbaa putting together two beds, one big for himself and one little for Timon, we all know that Timon will take the big in the first nanosecond. But that does not stop it being funny, which, IMO, is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. It's not what happens, it's like. <br /> <br /> And a warning: There are also some fart jokes. Did you really expect anything else in a movie that focuses on Pumbaa? But as fart jokes go, these are especially good and should satisfy even the very special connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The recurring vocal talent is great. I'm kind of surprised that some actors were willing to return, with most of them having only two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is great too. From "Digga Tunnah" at the beginning to "That's all I need", an adaptation of "Warthog Rhapsody" (a song cut from "The Lion King" that seems to have been much improved in this incarnation) The music behind me Nothing to complain about. <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are great characters, and you can also say that "Hakuna Matata" is simply an excuse to see them in various funny and different compromising situations. Then that's just it. It's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound scary? <br /> <br /> Anyway, 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'The Lion King' too often. Especially if you are thinking, "Do not be stupid, there is no Lion King" too many times!
