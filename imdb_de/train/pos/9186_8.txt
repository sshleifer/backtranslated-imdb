Adrien Wilde, photographer of the disturbed men's magazine (played by Michael Callan with great intensity), has terrible nightmares, in which he brutally murders his models. When the enchanting ladies really appear dead, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Author / director William Byron Hillman tells the gripping story at a steady pace, building up a reasonable amount of suspense and bringing some cruelly potent moments of cruel misogynistic violence (a woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake over her head) to be safer Climax), refreshingly emphasizes the lovingly drawn and appealing characters, performs everything in a plausible everyday world and fills it all with a nice dozen yummy female nudity. The good acting from an excellent cast helps a lot: Joanna Pettet as a sunny, charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adriens macho double amputee brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien worried psychiatrist dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adriens Feisty The gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as courageous homicide sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as die-hard police chief and Misty Rowe as cute, bubbly model Bambi. In the mature cinematography of R. Michael Stringer breathtaking panoramic aerial photographs are occasionally used. Jack Gogas ominous rattling result also succeeds. In fun little games Robert Tessier dive as grumpy bartender, Sally Kirkland as a naughty whore, Kathy Shower as a wild wrestler B.J. in the ring and Frances Bay in one of her usual old women's roles. A solid and pleasing picture.
