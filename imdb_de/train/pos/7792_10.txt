In the sea of ​​crap that Hollywood (and others) still expose, this is one of those diamonds in the rough. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and gives you the feeling that you have not wasted an hour and a half of your life. Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never really been a fan or had seen her before, but when I came back and saw this early performance of hers, she convinced me that she was extremely talented, was skeptical, that would even interest me. I thought, "Oh boy, a dumb chic or a feminist indie bastard ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant topics, I just say if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes down-to-earth, slice-of-life movies are the best, and that's great.
