This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable images, good acting and touching topics. It would be very easy to describe it as too sentimental, but that's the feeling this movie tries to achieve. I was totally involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There were a few cheesy shots, but this is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can make is that there were not many details. However, this film was not developed to explain any element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumph, controversy, failures, etc. It was designed for a quick look at some of the highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
