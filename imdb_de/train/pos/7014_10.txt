Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just saw Seven Pounds Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very in tune with the manifold human emotions. This movie was skilfully and beautifully made. Rarely in Hollywood today to find such an intense humanity. I would compare it to "pay it forward" and "crash" until the show of light and dark appears so raw. Stay with you for a long time and give you much to think about. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this. Not usually a "bad end," but rather a seeker of the truth that encompasses emotions, raw life, and more than the superficiality that abounds everywhere. That's why a little pain does not bother me in the end. It is true that there is not always a happy ending. Sometimes it's just not the happy end that you think should be. Many people were able to lead a happy life, even though the love and life of a human were lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
