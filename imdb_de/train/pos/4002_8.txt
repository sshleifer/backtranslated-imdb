At the beginning of the film, we look at May and Toots as they prepare to travel to London to visit their grown-up children. You can see that Toots is not in good health, but he goes along. When he suddenly dies, the world of May gets out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a screenplay by Hanif Kureshi, explores how this mother figure deals with her new status in life and her awakening to a world she did not even know that she existed until now. <br /> <br /> Mays life as a suburban woman was probably boring. Obviously her sex life was next to nothing. We learn that she had a short extra marriage, then nothing. When May loses her husband, she can not return home. Instead, she stays behind and takes care of her grandson in her daughter's house. In this environment, May begins to crave the young and fat Darren, the occasional lover of her daughter. <br /> <br /> Darren awakens in May a passion she has never known before. May reacts by changing in front of our eyes. May, who is stupid at the beginning of the movie, suddenly begins to dress up and becomes an interesting and attractive woman. She collapses headlong with this young man, who satisfies her with a passion she has never felt before. <br /> <br /> After knowing some similar cases in this story, it was no surprise to me to observe May's reaction. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends frustrating for May, who realizes How big is her sex with Darren. The younger man, we find out, is only in this matter to satisfy himself and extort money from May. Finally, daughter Helen discovers what Mum did behind her back when she discovers her mother's erotic images. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. With Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who contributes so much to the role of May. Amazing is also Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also crucial to the story, as her mother has to stand against the back of her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as Bruce, the older man in the class of Helen, and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The movie is worthwhile for those who will see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
