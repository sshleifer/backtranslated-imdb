This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but this is a movie made to understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, and so on. Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are used with a variety of talented actors and an understanding of the sport. The story was believable and I love the message. William Dear and the boys have put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films are about true stories or events and often do not work well. But this film reaches a 10 on the perfection scale, even though a few minor errors have occurred here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
