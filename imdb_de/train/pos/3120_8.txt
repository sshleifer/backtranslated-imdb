Paul Greengrass has definitely saved the best Bourne in the end! I've heard that many people complained about how he filmed this movie, and some even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding? Come on, it was not that bad. I think it helps the action scenes to be more realistic, which I would prefer a highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I did not notice that at all. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Damon really got used to the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in that case, it's a really good thing. In this episode he becomes Jason Bourne. Damon also has a great side cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast as it gave the secret CIA organization more depth. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is filled with great auto-chases and nonstop action, they've managed to pretty much keep up the character development in their with all that's going on. This movie goes far beyond the other two Bourne films and is definitely one of the best films of the summer season 2007!
