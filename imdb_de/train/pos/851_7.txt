Pierce Brosnan has drunk his last martini and returns in an outrageous self-parody, as the aging, obnoxious, fiery assassin Julian Noble, who has a penchant for girls, bullfighting and sticky clothing. While working in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a Denver-faced businessman who's in a hotel bar in the city to make his twilight years. Despite their completely different personality and Julian's rude and insensitive remarks, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Shepard, directed by Richard Shepard, who was mainly portrayed by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, revealed that he did not write the film for Pierce Brosnan, but I can do it without hardly imagine him. He is a true comedy talent and can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene in which they meet in a shiny hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) is truly a bravado. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully scanned, the two actors largely improvise, but they succeed! It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEET's improvisation and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre clich√©s and their own typography of actors (notably James Bond by Brosnan). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story gets thin after a while. After an hour, the film runs out of air. Still, and I can not say for sure, I really liked that. It just feels very fresh and original, with imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not very busy, but this movie offers something new. In this regard, he manages almost effortlessly to mix all conventional genres into an entertaining parody. Very amusing. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
