Having been a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for some time and owning some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying and a bit more than I expected. I am an artist myself (I work in clay) and it is essential to find inspiration in our environment to do good art. This is something that Andy Goldsworthy masters. The director follows him for more than a year and captures the spontaneous energy, skill and dedication to connecting the artists with nature with a dramatic inspiring flair. The music to the film is hugging and intoxicating. If you are an artist in need of inspiration, or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, SEE THIS FILM. I'm glad to know that Andy is out there somewhere. Create, dance, wrestle with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
