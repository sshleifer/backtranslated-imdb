I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and have seen many of his films and none of them stopped making me laugh. Not even how to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This movie is essentially about a man who is good at annoying people. However, he has an innate ethic that prevents him from doing things that may make him famous. But in the end he does it, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is characterized by humor, romance, good acting and a bit of lapdance. It's one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.
