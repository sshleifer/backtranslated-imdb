It put together a few characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to rescue a human baby and bring it back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friend. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is done (only through 20th Century Fox). The trailer for the movie was one of the best I've ever seen, but the movie does not meet the trailer's expectations. The problem lies in the fact that the creators of the film have not decided who the target audience of the film is. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the movie is mainly aimed at children. The parents will be glad that 90 min. Their children's attention is focused on something other than theirs. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good, but that's just a beautiful movie. Kids will love this movie, adults just love it.
