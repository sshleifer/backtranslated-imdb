I love Monte Carlo and I really enjoyed this movie. I found everyone very good. I did not know Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very personable, witty and attractive. Sean Young was very good, because the confused rejected girl with a golden heart. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has one day as a bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard showed a very sweet performance as a nice, vulnerable, ignored housewife. Gorgeous ensemble cast. A lot of talent, clever screenplays, lots going on and beautiful locations. Just a nice pickup for a dull day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not on the horizon.
