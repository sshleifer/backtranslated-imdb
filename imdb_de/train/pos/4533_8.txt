The first time I saw Buster Keaton's first feature film, I have to admit that I liked him a lot and just wished I'd found it years ago. The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that 1954's three-era nitrate pressure was rediscovered and salvaged in time for the burnout, and many frames that seem to be hopelessly stuck together have been severed. So it's rocky looking at places, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been OK as the 3 short films, but as an intolerance attitude, it's resourceful and humorous from the start: in the Stone Age with Badace the Wallace Beery on an elephant and Goodie Buster on a pet brontosaurus; In Roman times Buster rides a car with wheel locks and is suitable for sledding. In this technological age of speed Need and Greed need his car at the first hump nicely to pieces. Both he and Beery are by age after the girl, a never-ending quarrel. Favorite piece: As the caveman, he is knocked over a ledge backwards, but still kisses the camera - one or two amazing seconds! <br /> <br /> Great stuff that confirms my love for silent movie comedy.
