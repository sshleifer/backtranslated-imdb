I saw this movie after seeing Practical Magic, and the older movie was far superior. I liked the way lighting, make-up and costumes changed when Gillian changed in history. Jimmy Stewart's mannerisms did not do much for me in this film, but I suppose they served to highlight the reserve of Gillian's character. I was also impressed by Nicky and Gillian's mannerisms - it was as if the director wanted him to be effeminate and Gillian wants to be male. The gestures that Nicky makes when he shows Redlich have particularly impressed me. I never considered sorcerers to be feminine, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
