I love Jack's jokes like "The stereotype is ..." or "Above the top clich√© guy, black, greasy skin, kind of scary ...". He is just funny! Daniel starts to catch up with him! Good that Jack is not in the team anymore (in a way) or otherwise it would have been sarcasm mania !!!! The actors are great, I'm starting to capture facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's all theoretically possible and exciting ... whoops! I'll go back !!! I'm sorry, I'm starting to pick up on Carter's features as well, and all of this is driving my parents BENEFITS !!!!!!! Well, in the end, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially when they pack the episodes with all the humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!! !
