THE ODD COUPLE (3+ of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I always feel like Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the ultimate "odd couple". Her unbelievable work on the TV series from the early to mid-1970s was a high point for television at that time ... exceeding the stage and screen versions of the story. How can you do anything wrong with a pair of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau? Matthau is in an excellent shape as an Oscar, the slob. Lemmon takes some getting used to as Felix, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance before. The script is good ... definitely Neil Simon's best. (I'll note here that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most overrated dramatists of American theater.) The plot is simple: Felix, a decent freak and newly separated from his wife, pulls in at Oscar the Slob who needs help to save money on child support payments. Their cohabitation will also be like a marriage culminating in some amusing tiffs and gimmicks. Have fun and great Einliner.
