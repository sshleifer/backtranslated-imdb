I am a man who is not dedicated to women's films, but this is a really successful special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a great job while DeNiro is his usual great self. Everything is done so well: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story about real people and real love, this is a winner.
