This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually, the look of other animated films made me reluctant to see them. Not ice age. I wanted to see it soon when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby that has been put into the past 20,000 years. The visuals were great. Just beautiful. It's one thing to create a compelling attraction, it's another thing to create visually exciting material, and Ice Age is great with its stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future.
