Saving Grace is a feel-good movie whose heart is in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes that her late husband has burdened her with many debts. She could lose her beautiful house and sees no other solution to her misery than to grow marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live, and the villagers are all wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one thing with this picture, and it is the way marijuana affects the user. It is obvious that none of the actors or authors of this movie actually smoked the stuff. The way the villagers behave after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. Exactly in these scenes joke is replaced by English slapstick, and that's a shame, if the movie is still very pleasing.
