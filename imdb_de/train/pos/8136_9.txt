This movie is a great documentary. It follows the rap group NWH, which is made up of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, through their unique path to gangster rap highs, lows and back to heights. Through anger with women, egos, cops, and whites, this group is at the forefront of the gangster rapeseed world, as this film heads to documentary filmmaking. I know Allbodies favorite footage is "This is Spinal Tap," for a very good reason. However, I think this movie is just better when it's in the right mood. The laughter never stops, even for someone who does not engage in rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white guy who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else, no matter how much I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, wrote songs and played in them, showed great potential and it is a pity I have not seen him since Fear of a Black Hat. However, I have seen him once more than you, and that is, I recommend the fear of a black hat for a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Do not forget: "Do not shoot 'em white! .... out of their eyes? No, do not shoot, you'll see the whites." <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
