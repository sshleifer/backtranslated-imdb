This is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty fascinating dramatic story that also includes romance. The story is told slowly, but that works only too well for the construction. The characters are nice and nicely portrayed by the actors. Normally, I'm not too big a fan of Asian acting style, but the acting in this movie was just fine. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film's approach and style are different from other genre films in the West. In a sense, this film is already more advanced in its approach than Western films shot in the same era. <br /> <br /> I just wish the movie had a slightly better visual style. For a film that is considered a kind of Kunsthaus film, this movie certainly lacks some good-looking sequences. This was obviously a pretty cheap movie and was pretty generic. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this movie from really different and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But alright, this movie is all about his well constructed story and characters. In this respect, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
