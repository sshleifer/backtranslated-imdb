Let me first say that this show was at the top when John Ritter was there. After his death, the show went back a bit, but the producers did not give up the show and added James Garner and David Spade from 2003 to 2005 the regular cast. <br /> <br /> The show center around the Hennessy family Paul (John Ritter, may he rest in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and her son Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I had to scream with laughter (and I'm proud to admit that), but now that he's gone, I only occasionally laugh with a hearty laugh. I am very glad that I fell into the trance of this show after Ritter's early death, because it made the Eps with Ritter so much better. <br /> <br /> Knight's character is just as well played and well rounded that you can I help him, but I love him. He always has the girls on dating, but he really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy who hates friend entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great and she too is a sympathetic character. After her death, her character not only gives her kids so much influence and power, but I believe that Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers because she and Ritter were friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person in the show would be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: beautiful, slow, dull and yet a smart person. She is funny with her innocent "blond" humor and how cocky she is. Amy Davidson can get annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only flaw of the show is that the show Kerry never really has something to look forward to. She's always on the lookout for Bridget, and her character feels like she's been thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the only Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, he's mainly comic material. After the death of Ritter, the show delivers some storylines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are anything but a laugh, with the occasional side story for C.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father as background information. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this show a great review because it's a great show that has a tragic event that cripples it. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - Spy
