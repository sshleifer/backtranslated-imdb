As you watch this movie, you begin to realize what a drastically under-exploited property the late Dudley Moore was. There should be a dozen films like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was already a first-rate talent before moving to Hollywood, both as a comedian and as a musician. Mostly he is remembered for his pairing with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of these was "Bedazzled". <br /> <br /> He was always overshadowed by Cook, whose jealousy and meanness dissolved their partnership, allowing Moore to realize his true potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script fits in perfectly with his style with lots of funny, almost surreal conversations. There is something so British about him that I am really surprised that he found American taste so appealing. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian in the same fashion, tended to draw a void. It is Moore's almost childlike vulnerability that is so lovable. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play direct roles against him but still have excellent one-liners. Above all, John Guilgud has a sarcastic-Serbian authority, which is a true treasure. He invariably steals every scene he plays in, earning his Oscar quite well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played another comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up movie titled 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never reaches the same sublime levels it achieves, but it's still pretty good. Guilgud only gets a cameo at the beginning and as a ghost. It is darker And there are some interesting soul searches. It will disappoint when you first see 'Arthur'. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in cuddly Dudley after these two outings. He eventually returned to Britain, dejected and seemingly dying. <br /> <br /> But "Arthur" is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he should have done. <br /> <br /> You are sadly missing, Dudley.
