Wow, I can not believe I've been waiting for this movie for so long. I just never came to see it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football (football). I'm one of those American idiots who has no idea. I had never seen David Beckham before. I decided to ignore the excitement of this movie when it was released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> To be honest, ignoring this little piece of movie heaven was a mistake. What a funny movie. It's full of color and cockiness. I had a stupid grin on my face throughout the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and amiable that you can not help but choose her. No wonder why the American television show E.R. she took with her. I have a new appreciation for the Indian culture. These people know how to enjoy themselves. The wedding scenes are beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was to decode some of the English colloquialisms and dialogues through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I am sure that the global audience has difficulty understanding the ever-changing slang in American films. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. It has a great sport like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that gives women more power. I saw it with my wife and my sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
