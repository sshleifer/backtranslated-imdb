This is my first comment on the IMDb website. The reason I write is because we talk about ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER! "Ne goryuy!" They will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love with the Georgian choral singing tradition (if you are not yet a fan!) And you may accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it :) What I want In this film, actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The film shows Vahtang Kikabidze (who is great), but you will remember every single face in the movie. You will find that you are quoting the lines that have become so common to so many Russian-speaking people. A movie to life. Simple and deep, you will want to see it again and again.
