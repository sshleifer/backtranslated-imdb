SPOILER ALERT! This film, Zero Day, gives an insight into the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for everyone and everything connected with their school. <br /> <br /> You are going on a series of self-designed "missions", all leading to the huge mission that is zero day. Zero Days content will not be reported until the end of the movie. The viewer knows that he is serious and filled with hate, but he is never sure until the end. Now we all know if the movie is based on the Columbine massacre, the end is pretty obvious. And the end is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their classmates in the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of films about this attack and this movie by far is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and insight into the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and frankly, gives the viewer something of an understanding and closure of the terrible event. Being Only 7 The events took place, I never knew the seriousness of the shootings until my English lessons were assigned an essay or story about a crucial moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone should pick the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because, of course, the twin towers were tragic and very defining, but I did not think it was the right choice for me, because there really was no way there was only in 3rd grade and had no idea what that all meant. But the shootings left and work. I remember the interviews, the view of the school's skies and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a captivating, down to earth movie and a terrific masterpiece and I would recommend it to anyone.
