It is so rare to find a movie that delivers an action that can not be found on every move. Surprises throughout the area. <br /> <br /> A few things I could not fully understand is that you have the main female character playing "the good girl, hard worker," and in the end, an antisocial risk carrier ends up being. That was not enough to dislike me, but it gave me a break. <br /> <br /> The other thing I could not get was the old man who was taken away by the police at the end of the movie. I never knew who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what they could be. <br /> <br /> The movie was always exciting and fun and always advised me. Definitely worth seeing.
