As a pretty profound fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I saw one that really made me jump (or fidget). <br /> <br /> will definitely put this on DVD when it comes out ... much better than the ring. What I do not understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was awful. If that's how you think it is like this ... I know what I liked and it takes a lot to make me actually be scared, so I have to say it's worth it to look at it. <br /> <br /> You could be disappointed in history if you need everything in a neat and orderly manner. Because the plot goes back a bit to make the story (I think if it were shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing.) <br /> <br /> I'm really glad about this movie had very little bloody mess ... maybe the rest of you will be studio writers and whatever you realize that you do not have to spill the red stuff all over the sentence to scare people.
