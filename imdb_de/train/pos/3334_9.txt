I really liked this movie because I have a husband, just like the guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey, who hits Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is gone. She falls in love, but when spring comes, she gets the shock of her life as she stands one step lower on her pedestal than Ben has put on her. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession Ben has. He can not part with what he loves most, that makes him so funny and why so many women can connect with Lindsey in real life. Also, the people he plays baseball are as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie, and you will not slam if you rent it.
