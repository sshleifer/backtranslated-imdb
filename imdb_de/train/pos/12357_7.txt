I really liked this movie and saw it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Detmers nailed the show - she was hunting like a hungry cat and playing with her prey. Anger and lust strikes her, takes a "too young" lover and pushes hundreds of fine porcelain pieces of the mother of her terrorist fianc√© to the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful details. The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I especially liked the ancient Greek lessons and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> <br /> It had a sense of 'Story of O' - that is, when people indulge in means of unbridled sexual adventures. As she walks through the fantastic apartment she feels good - and why not, what is a "devil in the flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real treat!
