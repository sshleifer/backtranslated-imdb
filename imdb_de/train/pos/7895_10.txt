In the opening scenes of this film, a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights. This must have been very tough for 1936, but rather far away and had nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not appear as far as I could. However, Bette Davis ("Daisey Appleby"), "The Whales of August" (87), was very young and attractive and played one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey has never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and the so-called swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), The Spiral Staircase, 46. Daisey even suggested marrying Johnny in a reverse Ferris wheel and even got a blue eye. Davis and Brent were a great couple, one of them probably very rich and the other a very bad reporter. In addition to the stage, Davis and Brent had a really hot love affair, which is a good reason why there were sparks when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
