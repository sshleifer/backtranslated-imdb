This movie is huge to raise the spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I see him, I see and hear funny little things that I've missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) composed the songs and made Strange Fruit the best thing that has ever been achieved by today's music scene. Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly invented 60s to 70s band that was never good due to drug use and internal fighting. One wonders what could have happened while listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit are each inspired by The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Member of Fruit are pretty memorable. Stephen Rea plays Tony Costello, who is dead right from the start, as a star. He is asked by a festival organizer to reunite his band on a reunion tour, hoping to raise money. Costello happily approaches ex-roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a long-gone dream. Juliet picks up the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes) and mutilates Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot) and the extravagant, glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Another ex-roadie is the hippy-toker-jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never let the flame burn out. <br /> <br /> When Juliet searches for the last member of her colorful band, the elusive guitarist and songwriter Brian Lovell (played by the brooding Bruce Robinson), the reunited members quarrel as in ancient times and fight for their rusty talents , <br /> <br /> The band then has the chance to make a concert small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. After the young Hendrix-like Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) took the place of Lovell, the crew set off. The sparks fly as their memories flicker and threaten to burn their unfinished targets ... <br /> <br /> Be ready to laugh, sing, cheer, and cry as these memorable characters enter theirs Dig up the heart. ,
