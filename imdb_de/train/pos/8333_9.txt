IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that brings together the greatest and most deeply minded scientific minds of the twentieth century as Cupid's aides. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this carefree, but thoughtful film. They do not really know how to react, because great scientists sometimes do stupid things to promote the burgeoning love, but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of our time. The end result is a fun movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a bizarre, absent-minded mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly trained, science-obsessed worker. Together, they form an awesome journey through love and science, mind and heart.
