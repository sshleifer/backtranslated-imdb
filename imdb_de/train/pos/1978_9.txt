This production of Oliver is masterful in showing the evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly glowing, invisible character that permeates this darkness as it guides an innocent boy safely through the greatest dangers into his loved one's hands. Yes, though Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. A rod and a staff are there to comfort him. In the end he will be saved from the remnants of humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the nastiest of them all. Fagin is considering not regretting his path twice, but twice because he is unwilling to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is not appeased, but also untried. The best is Nancy. It lacks judgment and ignores Bill Sikes' violent nature from her deep desire for love. Unlike Fagin, however, she repents her sins at the cost of her own life by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they seem. In my opinion, this quality is worth art - unpredictability. I would give this movie a "10", but its soundtrack and the 1970s ambiance that was made for the TV distract. All in all a nice parable and a very fitting story for every audience.
