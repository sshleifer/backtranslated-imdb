I just saw Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What a great movie and an incredible young man. This film is a must for anyone who deals with the abuse and abandonment of child abuse as an adult. Denzel Washington shows a great performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex Alarm - Feels good and whiny. The most exciting moment is when he finally meets his mother, from whom he was taken away at the age of 2 months. And one of the bravest was when he opposed his abusive foster mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and just wished that I knew it years ago. Definitely a movie that can be added to my DVD collection.
