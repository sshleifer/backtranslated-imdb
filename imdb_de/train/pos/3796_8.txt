Jim McKay has made one of the best movies you can see year-round. The quiet simplicity of this film draws from the opening reception and never lets go of you. There is no wrong note in the entire movie. Not one. Everything works. The handheld camera never distracts and is always there where it should be. The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real. There is no single beat to which the public mind that we are looking for actresses who play a role only real girls trying to find himself. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is cinema in its most basic form, and although it is probably only seen by a handful of moviegoers, it deserves a much broader release. Special thanks go to Hugh Hefner for providing the filmmakers with the necessary grant money to make this important film to be able to produce. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing next.
