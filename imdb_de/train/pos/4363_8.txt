It's a little bit disturbing to have a character called Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But in this movie, Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under a different name. <br /> <br /> I will go against the majority of the other comments, claiming that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly because of the vivacious performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was witty, angry, vulnerable, caring and lively like the eldest of three daughters whose mother died at Lusitania and whose father was later killed in Iraq during the war I. In this house, Fiona has stood firm for years against her father's will, which allowed a Donald Trump guy named Charles Barclay to get the family home. But Fiona keeps a secret why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle flirting sister, who is married to an Englishman, but longs for the friend of her youngest sister (Gig Young). If you're a Stanwyck fan, this is a must.
