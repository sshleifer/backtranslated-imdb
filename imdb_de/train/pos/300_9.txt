With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout the cast and crew, "They all laughed" is a very family affair. If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A. Hepburn had a short but passionate affair in a previous painting, this has the air of almost a private movie that was made for the enjoyment of the participants and that entertaining one broader audience is only a supplementary consideration. If all this smells of complacent "joke" - masturbation, you'll be pleased to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich sails well this particular danger and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" This is also an altar on which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Do not make mistakes, this is her picture. Mr Gazzara is in all her scenes together. The plot - a detective agency that is too personally involved in the affairs of its clients - is of lesser importance, it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the film. Mr. Bogdanovich's triumph of "targets" lies in the way his camera seems to love his actors. There is a sparkle in each of his films that only special artists can elicit with an inanimate optical device. Miss Hepburn especially benefits from this love. For additional insights into his work, read the published collections of his essays on stars and directors, notably Who the Hell's in It ?, which has recently remained in British bookstores. The soundtrack to "They Laugh Everyone" varies from Louis Armstrong's New York City Hall Concert of 1947 to Sinatra to Country to Latin, as diverse as the city she described. Mr. B's picture "Golden Boy" was certainly exhausting, because that's the movie business, but it's just as safe to be restored one day, and when that day comes, "they're all laughed at," fine work acknowledged for the cinema, which it is.
