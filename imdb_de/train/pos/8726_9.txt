Well, that's how a family movie should be! There are few films in recent years that are aimed at families or children who are really worth seeing the audience. but that's one of them. My whole family left the movie, impressed, entertained, blinded and happy. We quote here and there even small anecdotes. The kids loved it and so we have (Hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from the beautiful and striking animation, the characters (as small as they may be) and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There are none of them that you can not empathize with. The personalities that bring these little creatures to life are well-spoken vocal talents, combined with the skill and art of some of Disney's best animators. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney himself. I think Mr. Disney would heartily approve of this new movie ... Flick, Dot and her band of little heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family leaving the theater want to see again .. and buy on video or dvd. I'm looking forward to seeing it again ... what I missed the first time. (Never before have I seen how my kids have identified and hugged characters so quickly and vividly ... my daughter still talks about the little "dot".) This movie is funny, heartwarming, smart and great fun for the kids whole family!
