"Such a long journey" is a well-developed film, a good shoot and a showcase for good performances. However, history is such a jumble of subterranean and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of "all-rounder" and "master of all." Even the western audience will probably find the esoteric of the rather obscure Parsee culture in 1.7 hours a little bit. Recommended for people with an interest in India.
