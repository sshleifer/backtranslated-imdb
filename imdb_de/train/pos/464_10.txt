I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves and became even more fascinated by her reach and talent in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this breathtaking portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and gathering to mother the tortured soul of the child of a man who obviously needs the mother. Her eyes are the mirror of his soul - and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are. <br /> <br /> Anyone who takes things literally will find Marleen Gorris's poetic and allegorical direction very frustrating. Romantics willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is that this allegorical poem is rewarded.
