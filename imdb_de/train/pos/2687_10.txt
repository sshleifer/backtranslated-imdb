In no other movie did I feel that way before ... and I do not feel bad. I do not want my money to come back, nor the time I've been waiting to watch this movie (9 months), and I do not want to spend two hours on a sunny summer's day watching this movie. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how hard my brain tears, I just do not seem to have a word in each of the seven languages ​​the movie was in. I have no idea what was going on all the time, and when I went through half the movie, I needed a breather. No movie has ever done that to me before. Never in my life did I want so much cauliflower, milk and baguettes. Many Thanks. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * clears throat * No words. No thoughts I do not know. I really do not know it. - Cait
