After reading the other mild reviews and comments, I felt I had to come for this film. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films tend to have little to do with each other, and expected this movie to look like one of them. The one you like is probably wrong. <br /> <br /> What this movie is is a thoughtful and unadulterated look at the religious faith. The only other film he would have, in terms of his religious message, would be Tolkin's The Rapture. <br /> <br /> I am amazed that someone could say that the story is confused or supernatural. It's a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and salvation - though you would never guess it until the very end. It's also the only movie I can think of whose resolution literally depends on a pun. <br /> <br /> As a (happy) fallen Catholic, I know what the movie is all about, and I find a sort of fondness in its last innocence about the relationship between God and man. However, if you are not familiar with the kind of theology the film is based on, it will be over your head. <br /> <br /> As a movie - unlike a story - "Cold Heaven" is not groundbreaking. While "The Rapture" is burdened with pictorial meaning and cinematic imagery, Cold Heaven plays down its own cinematic qualities. There are no noticeable settings, no edgy effects, no attempts to adapt the content to the form. It is a manual shooting, but subject. It also has no dialogue or acting to bring it into a class of high drama. It's a simple story that just unfolds. It may seem strange. but in the end the secret is revealed. It looks ambiguous; But with a single line the ambiguity disappears in one go Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this context, "Cold Heaven" has exactly the same thing that drives a movie like "The Sting". "or" The Sixth Sense "or" Final Descent "or Polanski's" A Pure Formality. "All these are films with a trick up their sleeve, they can frustrate you along the way, but they have a point - an obvious point - but The fun, at least in part, is being recorded. <br /> <br /> Even though It seems to be more than a shaggy dog ​​story with a punch line, it's worth paying attention to how it guides you and it misleads you. Try it - especially if you are or were a Catholic.
