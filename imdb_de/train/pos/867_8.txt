As in Amelie, recent French films seem to adopt a stereotypical relationship between men and women based on a woman who finds her only true love. In this case, despair leads to a convict that leads to its development into a prototype of the mob. A clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a bit quick, but not unreasonable. The soundtrack, which seems increasingly to be the case with European films, is great and fits in perfectly with the variations of the film. Nothing seems to be forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror films. There's a sense of Wes Craven in Chicago.
