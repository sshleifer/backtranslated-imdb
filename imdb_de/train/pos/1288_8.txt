Preston Waters has a bad summer. Apart from his upcoming birthday, nothing else looks promising. First, he has to share his own room with his brothers, who run a business. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. At a birthday party he gets only $ 6, while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. If one of his birthday cards comes early, he will only receive a check for $ 11. <br /> <br /> When he goes to the bank, he learns that he needs at least $ 200 to open an account. When leaving the bank, a tyrant steals the check. When he goes after the child, he is almost run over by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer) (his bike is definitely going to be ruined). Quigley's just came off the bench because he gave the owner $ 1,000,000 tomorrow. Quigley starts writing a check for the damage, but he only manages to write his name before a police car orbits the area. Out of fear, he hands the check to Preston and instructs him to hand it over to his father. However, that evening, Preston tells his father he does not want a new bike, he wants his own room, better his own house. His father restricts him to his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston believes that things can not get any worse. He realizes that he has forgotten the check because he is still in his shirt pocket. It is empty. <br /> <br /> With the computer and after careful consideration, he makes it out for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to cash it in at the bank, he is taken to the owner, who thinks he is the person he should give the $ 1,000,000. He is not like the real person named Juice comes a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now the three Preston have to track down. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston enjoys buying all sorts of things, including his own home, and even dates with a disguised banker who's really an FBI agent (trying to track down the three bad guys). He turns that person's name into Mr. Macintosh, for whom he works, and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But eventually everything will catch up (the money runs out, the bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> All in all a pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you enjoyed it in another stake out, you will love it here. He does all sorts of crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed boss of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful, friendly chauffeur in this movie.
