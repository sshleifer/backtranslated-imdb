This is a great movie everyone should see. It plays like a Dean Koontz book. Bill Paxton's performance has been great, as if he really believes in what he says and does. I do not know why viewers need to read some sort of religious murder advocacy into the movie. It is fiction. The end is surprising, but fictional. So what? I think that makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM. Throughout the film, viewers are constantly shocked by the illness of Paxton's character, the impact on children, and the way the children deal with this vile behavior. And in the end, it turns out to be true. God has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clear-sighted, as other viewers suspect. Sure, he gets information he could not have known otherwise, but the movie goes on to show how God "protects" Adam through the comfortable video quality problem and lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not advocate a Christian murder, it just takes the viewer on a very unexpected ride.
