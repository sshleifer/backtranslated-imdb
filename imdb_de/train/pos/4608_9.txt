Jackie Chan is considered by many movie and martial arts fans to be one of the biggest action stars ever shot on screen, and Police Story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late, great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon contained the so-called benchmark of Lee's size in the 70s, one can say the same about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. Forget the Rush Hour trilogy or All of his efforts in the US - the one film that characterizes Chan's excellence, not to mention his status as a high-end, punch-hard kung fu talisman, and his film career was , Police Story - the first in a series of successful police films playing on the mainland of today's Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I've seen many of his efforts - including the US-based Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo - and frankly, many of them pale in comparison to Police Story as insignificant. In these movies, we saw a less "muted" version of Jackie, of which the opportunity to use his fighting skills to the maximum was not to mention, not to mention that the combat sequences were not as good as the Drunken Masters in such efforts, To call police history. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this film are extraordinary and best seen in any action movie. The shopping mall scene is literally unique and must be seen to believe: the flying glass splinter Chan dangling only with his walking stick in front of the bus, while a madman drives desperately through the streets of the city, and Chan successfully used all kinds inanimate objects and props as weapons to fight the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Considering that he is known to hurt and break every bone in his body and endanger himself, Jackie's insistence on showing his versatility as a stuntman shows himself not to one, some evidence of his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially since he has the bruises for it. He has proven that he is not a one-trick pony when it comes to designing and developing different and subtle-looking moves. <br /> <br /> There is not much to discuss in the story, but about It lacks narrative, it makes up for its end-to-end action and combat sequences. As far as the dialogue is concerned, that's not really a big aspect of the film. That's why most fans of Jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action than in history. <br /> <br /> Unlike The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI or some form of computer tricks. What you see is what you get - and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie-Chan epic, full of action and pulsing stunts. <br /> Police Story is an excellent movie and I would like it Definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice of Jackie Chan but is not sure which one to see first.
