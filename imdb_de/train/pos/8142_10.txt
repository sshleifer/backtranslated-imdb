Chances are, you think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time around. But if you happen to see it a second, third and fourth and fifth time (I'm now in the hundreds), you'll spit a line here and there and pull yourself together! My friends and I were actually scared of Black Hat parties to get more from our friends, "as they say in the riots".
