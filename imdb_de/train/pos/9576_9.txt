One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. This is an action melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes the action brought tears to my eyes, the next moment it brought shocking revelations like a bone-heavy punch into the stomach. Disappointing performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK cop and a Cambodian murderer chasing each other down as they gradually lose their humanity is a powerful story. "Dog Bite Dog" is a pure HK bloodshed without heroism.
