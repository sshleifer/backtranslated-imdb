This movie is great. As often heard, it is very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike other people, I am clearly not of the opinion that Austria as a pro-fascist society is depressing, negative or dismantled. On the contrary: While there are indeed some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are very bad people, you can watch Ulrich Seidl's movie Love, Beauty and Humor at the same time. And that is exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to portray the life of the "ordinary people" intensively and realistically; their hustle and bustle, their desires, their downsides: Seidl obviously does not try to prove that the lives of working-class workers are garbage! In my opinion, the viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that virtually no one is alive, as "clean" and "normal" as we would like others to believe. And that every life has its dark and often oppressive sides. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese, who dances his old girl in the oriental way, as he calls it. I think anyone who finds this scene ugly lacks beauty and should wonder what it is, that is Protofashist: the characters in HUNDSTAGE or spectators who are dismissed from the corpse of an over 70-year-old woman and dance with all her charms for her lover.
