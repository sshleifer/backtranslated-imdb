Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for all who like Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The protagonist of the film is definitely the bastard son of these two foreign fathers. The other characters are known transformations of similar action movie stereotypes. Where this film originally comes from is the mix of traditional Hong Kong film style with the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately, this does not apply to the films he made in Hollywood.
