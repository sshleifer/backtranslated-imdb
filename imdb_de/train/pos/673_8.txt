About the great gap we call understanding, we do not yet know much about what was explained by the early tribal elders. In any case, there is much about the dangers of too much knowledge. Conversely, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn, the 'end times'. In this film called "The Last Wave," a natives are murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they are silent, disturbing the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defender to defend the accused. Although Burton was struck by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned of modern signs given him by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton defends the violation as a tribal law and is therefore not subject to standard justice. The film is full of mysterious, dark, unsuspecting images of apocalyptic catastrophes and warns of a future tsunami and sinking of the island. Black drama and deep rituals give this film a scary appeal and are therefore not for the faint of heart. In fact, the simplest haunting phenomena can last for years in the nightmares of innocent moviegoers. Good silent drama. ****
