Do not let the naysayers influence you. This is a wonderful scary movie. This was a final project for the writer / director JT Petty. He did a great job of getting me on the edge of the seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a well-worn horror movie this is Nirvana! The film is about an elderly man living in an isolated log cabin in the woods. One day, as he searches for his cat in the woods, he experiences the murder of a child, right? He is annoyed about the rest of the movie. The most unusual thing about this film is that there is no dialogue until the last scenes. I found that fascinating. The author manages to grasp your senses and relentlessly attracts them. Try this movie, you will not be disappointed.
