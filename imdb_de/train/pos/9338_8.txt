The idea for this TV series may well come from the immense success that Ally McBeal enjoys worldwide in Germany. However, Edel & Starck differs from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work wonderfully together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by the well-known German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, do you understand ???), played by the charming Rebecca Immanuel, quickly exchanges romantic Repartees and spies constantly in sitcom-like criminal cases in and around Berlin. In addition, they are supported by a great cast of co-stars, most notably their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, a rare gem with great comic potential. Even the dodgy wheeler dealer Otto and the noble childhood friend of Felix, Frank, work very well, not to forget Sandra's best friend and roommate Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All in all a pleasure to see you on Monday night: No wonder the series and its stars have received several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
