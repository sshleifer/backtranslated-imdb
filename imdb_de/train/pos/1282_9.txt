I saw this a few times on the Sundance Channel a couple of years ago and got a nice jolt in the system. A semi-surreal, but hard-edged version of modern media culture (or lack of media) that focuses on some seriously crazy residents living far beyond Hollywood's fringe. It was an amusing early performance by Mark Ruffalo and some memorable footage from the DP who made the films of the Polish Brothers. There was a wild, uncompromising sense of humor and a funny, original feeling that definitely set him apart. This movie had cult classics, and I'm surprised it has not appeared on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
