Barriers seem to be one of the series lost in time fog. After the transmission in the early 80s and a repetition, it has since dropped without a trace. This is a terrible shame. <br /> <br /> I originally saw this when it was broadcast on Sunday afternoon in the southern TV region. Although I do not remember much about the program, I remembered a few things. Most notable were the unforgettable titles. The sad flute music accompanied the escape attempt across an Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and this scene has given me a lasting love for the "fintail" Mercedes models when they used a Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at first, the solution to the mystery of the series lay in these titles. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy over a young music student trying to figure out what really happened when he found out he had been adopted. Many twists and turns, but Barriers was a surprisingly "adult" childrens drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama that was overdue for a DVD release and I hope I get the chance to know it again in the future. <br /> <br /> A nice reminder of my childhood
