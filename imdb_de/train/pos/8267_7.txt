Brown of Harvard is a tough movie. We expect much more of our films these days. It therefore helps to remember that the audience in the 1920s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is as charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even fame. All the relationships in the film feel very static, except for the homoerotic connection between Billy and Jack Pickford, the nerd of the city. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It's a great education about how society has changed in the 20th century.
