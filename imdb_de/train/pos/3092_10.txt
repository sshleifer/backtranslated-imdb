You probably already know it all, but 5 additional episodes that have never been aired before can be viewed on ABC.com. I've seen a lot of television over the years, and this may be my favorite show I've ever seen. It is a crime that this beautifully written show has been canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Omg, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and natural in these roles. Even the kids are great. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I wonder why it was canceled. I can not believe that Ms. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. It was in the perfect time window in this market. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all will be released on DVD someday. Thank you for reading.
