I will not lie, this is a great movie. I saw it in my local theater about 4 months ago. I saw it a second time and was a bit bored in the slow scenes. Sid (the sloth) is not particularly flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending. It's worth taking children under the age of 10, but teens would probably find it a bit boring. Also, the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. Like I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I would rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8.10
