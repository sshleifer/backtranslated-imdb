I recently saw this movie because Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain has been successful. I thought I would see the movies I missed. I had no expectations of the movie and was stunned that I had missed this movie altogether. It's an enthralling story of father and son, and it's also an underdog story. I even shed a tear at the conclusion of this wonderful story. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give him a 9 out of 10 is that he slows down in the middle, but returns heavily in the end. The acting was great, the story was great and the cinematography was a captivating sight given the film. GO SEE THIS FILM! Rent it, buy it, watch it, love it! I know that I did it!
