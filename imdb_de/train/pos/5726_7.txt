"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he is not new, so he does what every intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets the logic and focuses on providing fun to the onlookers. He uses well-known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. The nonlinear narrative is not a game, but an interesting opportunity to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (the same way a comedy makes people laugh), this movie was a blast. I saw it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see people watching this theater. It probably does not play that well in your living room.
