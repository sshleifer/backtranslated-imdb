I remember how I saw it on TV. I could not believe that TVNZ took care of it! I had to own it! Much of the humor will be lost to non-NZ'ers, but give it a try! <br /> <br /> Matt and Chris have done bigger and better (?) things since completing the Back of the Y series. Randy Campbell, NZ's biggest daredevil stuntman, was often featured in the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he has still given up all his stunts because he is too drunk. <br /> <br /> Also the 'house band' Deja Voodoo has released two albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the "Back of the Y" team and singles like "I would give you one of my beers (but I only have 6)" and "you were not even born in the 80s" continue their humor <br /> <br /> The South By Southwest Film Festival also features the feature-length film "The Devil Made Me Do It," which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All up, if you do not find these people funny, then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
