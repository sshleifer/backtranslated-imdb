In addition to planes, trains and automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the funniest movie by John Candy. When hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the Manchurian candidate) and turned into a horny guy who does not know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes (both deal with male anatomy). The love scene with food has to be seen, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
