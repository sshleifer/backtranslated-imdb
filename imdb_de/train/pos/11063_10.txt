I was really impressed with Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what became clear from this film. Adrienne was an amazingly talented director, an original and unique artist. With absurd humor and a warmhearted optimistic and humanistic tendency, she managed to show the misery of everyday life. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Reg Rodgers, who looks like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the film "The Bastard Song" by Adrienne can be considered an optimistic eulogy: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering pain, <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you get bring, <br /> <br /> You'll get confused by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let the heartless get you done, <br /> <br /> Do not greet the heartless at your door , <br /> <br /> Do not live among the Heartless "
