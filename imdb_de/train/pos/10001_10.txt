Brilliant hyperfunction of Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in the clothes store are second to none. The grain on the face is a classic, just about everything in Blazing Saddles. Attorney attitudes are also excellent. After being accused of being a woolen coat, his boss sold, and rude, Pepto Bolt's lawyer shrugs indifferently, "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is also fantastic here, as a crazy millionaire who wants to destroy the ghetto. His character is more vicious than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where homeless people invade a demolition site are classics of all time. Watch out for the legs scene and the two big fighting backhoes (one bleeds). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is common).
