I think that the idea of ​​conspiracy is perfect for first exploring the emotional experiences of those involved and, secondly, as someone else wrote in a commentary, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and Lesianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... to start with the second aspect ... to make it short, it was not visible at all ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. As I said, it had a lot more potential ... I think that this kind of relationship carries much more tension ... Much more tension ... and the potential tension did not come through ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack could have been more than the few songs on the background and theme (which was nice, but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... I could have the lack of a better soundtrack. <br /> <br /> the actors ... I think they were somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in the main moments ... <br /> <br /> total 7 / 10 .... mainly for the story
