Do you remember H.G. Wells's "The Invisible Man"? Well, here's another movie, just more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who enters the world of invisibility and harnesses it for military purposes. The serum was initially the light part and the person did not return. Most of the first attempts ended unstably. Until one night when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was first and almost died, and when he came to it, it was a close one. When Caine did that, he decided to use it for fun. When he was tired of not being seen, the team tried to bring him back to the world of flesh. However, the visibility formula does not work as it should, and Caine would dive into insanity. So he becomes a crazy, invisible killer. It's best to just leave the city instead of taking the lives of people in your area. I would be less interested in those who did you wrong. Great movie, have fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
