I liked this movie because it did more with less. It could have been made more interesting if they had limited it even more to the studio (though some of the plot elements would have been more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The man who plays the DJ has done a good job of being shown by someone who was hunted and persecuted by his memories. I also found the dialogue with the callers pretty funny. <br /> <br /> While parts of the film can be seen as one mile away, other parts do not expect them to look the way they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was, for the most part, a rather minimal ghost story that focused more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done, as everything is revealed. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter movie, it was just the right time for me to tell the story. Even more and it would have started to pull.
