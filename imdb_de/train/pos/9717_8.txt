Honestly, losing friends and strangers is one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It is not one of those "gross" comedies that is heavily dependent on fart joke and toilet humor, but moves at a comfortable pace and you are easily bound to the unfolding story. Simon Pegg nails it with his witty portrayal of a fish-from-water character into the coffin and quickly disengages from the tripod he once belonged to in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting to the top of the Hollywood food chain is a difficult affair, as we can clearly see with Pegg. His first jab in the lead role was David Floder's comedy Run Fatboy Run, which received criticism and audience lukewarm reviews. His second attempt was this film, which received quite positive reviews from the majority, but was a flop in the box office. I still have not lost faith in him and I will still be there if he wants to take the third shot to glory. Other characters were well staffed from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst has done well in this film, as the love angle to Pegg's figure is still the spark that I saw in the interview with the vampire, is still lost. She has to find it quickly or she could suffer the consequences if she gets lost forever in the land of the "Rome Coms".
