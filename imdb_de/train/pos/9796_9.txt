In 1993, after the success of Batman's first season: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the hit show team to produce a feature-length feature film originally planned for direct-to-video, but faced a theatrical release became status. It became known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we released three more feature films from the WB guys (Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker), and now Mystery of the Batwoman comes to the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is fundamental and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female Vigilante modeled after Batman has begun to perform operations of Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot as a penguin , Now Batman must try to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the border. <br /> <br /> The animation is the slimmer, futuristic style used for Batman: The fifth and sixth season of the Animated Series (AKA) The new Batman adventures. It's pretty well done and just as slim as the animation of the Joker's return. There is also some use of CGI, but it is minor, compared to the abundance in Sub-Zero. The music was ok. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League rating, though the dots in the score when the old animated Batman theme appears, will send nostalgia waves through the rodent-hearted hearts of older fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy does a great job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back. These include Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl, her cameo reference to the love affair between her and Bruce mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were great too - especially as Rupert Thorne, the old Mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Overall Although MOTB has not yet fully achieved the standard of Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB continues to put the torch for the animated Batman movies on. And if you have the DVD and you're a hardcore fanatic, you'll love the five-minute short Chase Me.
