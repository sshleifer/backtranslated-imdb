There is so much value in this movie that it's hard to know where to begin with praise. Let me first express my admiration for a perfect representation of Reese Witherspoon. That their achievement stands out in the excellent cast is indeed a praise. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon shows the finest in filmmaking.
