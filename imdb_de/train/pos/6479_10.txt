This is first and foremost a fantastic series. It is very well done and very interesting. I had learned a lot before World War II, before I saw this series. One of the best things this has to offer is all the interviews with former people, when the war was relatively fresh in their heads, comparatively speaking. It's nothing against the men you see interviewed in today's programs, it's just that most of these men were not really involved in the top ranks of the action. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know about World War II, but really think that only the hard-core (like me) want to buy it or see it more than once. My only criticism of this whole series is that some facts are not quite as accurate as we know it today. Especially with the information about the Soviet Union in some places exaggerated or simply inaccurate. This information is now different, which we now know because of the fall of the USSR. All in all, a fascinating view of the Second World War and a must for any serious historian from the Second World War.
