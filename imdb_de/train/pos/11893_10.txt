The following two seasons of this original series were not exactly lackluster. The devastating transformation of the last seasons contributed to their short lifespan of three seasons. If the plug was pulled after the first season, he might have won a cult. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the first season was really funny! Funny, smart with excellent writing, it was promising. The excellent brew of the first season had the right ingredients - characters / actor, storyline and so on. Also, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was the original. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" in search of the exclusive day by day, day by day. <br /> <br /> Many things do not make sense to me. Like this show and another favorite of mine - Gross Pointe never did it. If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, would you please anyone out there ?!
