Tiempo de valientes is a very funny action comedy. After his great fist film El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron has done another great work. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and they have great performances here. The movie is very funny and funny and it gives great moments time.And I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
