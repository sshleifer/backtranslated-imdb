This movie is great. If you like to watch B-class movies, that's the case. This is a classic 1980s college slasher movie in which a song is played throughout the soundtrack. A terrible movie, but it's worth renting to make fun of it or see old men jumping out of their closets with knives. Funny, if you ask me.
