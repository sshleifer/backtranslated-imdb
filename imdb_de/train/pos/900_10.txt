This is one of the best Bollywood movies I have seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more films or films to keep the South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have behaved very well, their couple also draws a lot of people into the movies. This is a must-have movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This movie is also by the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This film is the best at the moment ... The scenery of the film was beautiful, which is also a big attraction. You have to see this movie ... recommended to everyone !!
