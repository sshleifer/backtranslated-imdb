For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha male ever portrayed on the big screen. He is a decent boy who leaves his parents' homestead and moves to Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to work in the petrochemical industry. The boom began in 1980, and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta is doing well that we are interested in the audience for his character, who, if you come straight to him, play a role of sexist pig He meets and marries Debra Winger of the same background, but she has some ideas that women should not be shadows of their husbands. And when she beats him at Gilley's mechanical bull, it's the right thing for him. Scott Glenn, a former convict, works at Gilley's and this movie was his breakout role. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a mere look and pulls Winger in. Travolta grapples with Madolyn Smith Osborne, who is slumbering at Gilley's. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was truly a gigantic commercial for the self proclaimed largest honky tonk in the world. Gilley's is no longer in the suburban community of Pasadena, Texas, but the memories continue to live. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country / western songs that were heard in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason why I can imagine why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I especially liked Johnny Lee's search for love. If he was written specifically for this movie, it's a shame that he was not nominated for the best song. <br /> <br /> I really liked the character of Debra Winger in this movie. She loses no trace of femininity, but defies Travolta and makes it stylish. And this report is dedicated to the unknown woman who will one day become the first Bull Rider of the Professional Bull Riders.
