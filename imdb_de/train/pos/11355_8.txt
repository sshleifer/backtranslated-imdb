I was surprised how fascinating this movie was. The performances were extremely good, especially by Rea as a compassionate no-nonsense detective. Despite a low budget, no big effects, or eye-catching camera work, Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood movies. Tell. The. Story. <br /> <br /> True stories end with a whimper rather than a bang, and that's the case here, but other than that, it's a highly recommended detective thread.
