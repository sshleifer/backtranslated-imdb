After seeing this movie strictly based on reviewers' reviews, I was extremely pleasantly surprised. Although it is a low budget, it has the mark of a clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I thought that her sense of isolation would be enhanced by an outside shot of her face and then moved backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And behold! The next scene was just the last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff by the water. There are other examples of how a clever director can bring his movie to a very entertaining thriller. Skilled spectators will surely spot them, but they should be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> George Macready is his usual creepy self who barely maintains his temper while he demonstrates the ability to undisturbed violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a no-nonsense girl who is not defeated without a fight. But Lady May Witty, oh boy, she even made me doubt my own eyes and believed that she could get away with her evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the rough and hard to miss.
