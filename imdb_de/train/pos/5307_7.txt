"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore, who is a big star in the public, in the media and in the local art scene. His pictures show the dirty reality of everyday life as well as dirty underwear or human excrement. It is a typical theme of John Waters' independent comedies from Baltimore, which show the comic sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative counter-reactions, exploring the background of middle-class society in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong from "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and long-time actress Mink Stole of Water. Although the pace of the plot sometimes becomes a big mistake and can not compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's ingenious "Serial Mom", it still has some good laughs and memorable scenes like a former junkie girl who loves it became a vegetarian when he sniffed peas from a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, about media hype, middle-class sex anxiety, and the strange ways to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
