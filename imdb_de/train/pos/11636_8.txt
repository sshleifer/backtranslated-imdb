Beautifully filmed, well-functioning, tension-filled tension film. I was on the edge of the seat. I really liked the lead actress and found the villain very well done. You can not chew on a subject here, but if you just sit down in your seat, turn off your brain, watch the fantastic camera work, and enjoy the action, you'll have a great time. The plot is well worn, and ordinary moviegoers will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. In earlier times, they might not have focused so much on two characters, and there were tantalizing moments when I hoped they would give some other people some lines. But these people were probably right to focus the film so sharply. The action got me pretty early and never let go. It is not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. Since I'm not sure that makes a lot of sense. Just sit back and enjoy it.
