Note that I did not say it was better ... just more fun. The lack of social commentary and realism helps to keep things moving. <br /> <br /> I was kind of surprised that this was not a Troma movie since it has all the hallmarks of Troma, including acidic liquids and wisecracks from the movie villain after every murder, a ridiculous bathtub-rape scene (which is pretty hard to annoy because the rapist is a snowman) and stupid MPs. <br /> <br /> There's a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman who's noticed he has no legs or feet drives a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Even though it should be close to (or below) freezing, no one breathes and there is no sign of car exhaust when cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. The snow reminds you more of flocking or peanuts made of styrofoam than of snow. <br /> <br /> 4. Just a few hours after her brother was cruelly murdered, a young girl gets the shots for his friend. She persuades him to break into the sheriff's house to put it on. But first she tells him he has to make a nice fire and open wine in the fireplace. <br /> <br /> 5. After cutting off the head of a sleigh-aged teenager, Jake argued with the sheriff if Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. The sheriff claims that Tommy did not fight with Jake because Jake is "at least two meters taller than Tommy." At that moment someone is ringing in the background: "Not anymore!" <br /> <br /> 6. As the evil snowman finally starts to melt, the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made of a kind of fabric for a long time. This is much better than Tarzan fighting rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have had a clear face at this point. <br /> <br /> All in all a funny movie. There is not even that much blood.
