Although we do not like to admit it, we have to suppress all our fears about the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events in this film. You know, you get in your car and immediately think, "Geez, I hope today my accelerator pedal is not at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 miles per hour." All four door latches lock in the locked position, a main and emergency brake fail 'My ignition switch can not be turned off, and I have a full tank of gas, all at the same time.' Fortunately, our Thorazine will work for most of us before we actually decide that driving a car is not a good idea. Not so for the creators of the terrible white knuckle, seat edge (if only to prepare to leave the room), Action Juggernaut "Runaway Car". But they continue anyway and drive anyway! I am so happy that I realized that this movie is real and I did not just dream it. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least one of the fantastic sights you'll see on your journey to find the El Dorado of Very Bad Cinema. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
