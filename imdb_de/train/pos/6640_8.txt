This one-minute movie is probably the first ever shot. Other inventors had previously filmed acts - such as Edison's sneezing motion photography - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that brought the medium forward enormously. At that time, of course, her "cinematographer" must have confused her peers, including her subjects. In the first case, the brothers record employees who have left their factory, some of whom understandably have difficulty concealing their attention to the camera. The Lumieres are trying to make the movie more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" is not exactly the ingenuity of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the selection of a well-known workers' ritual of the brothers as a theme. Her choice is the first proof of her curiosity for all people in the world, a quality that makes viewing her experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
