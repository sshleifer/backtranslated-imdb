You have to admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He paused for Zeenat Aman, a successful model and also a former winner of the beauty contest, by playing her in a role that was tailor-made for her debut. Her bespectacled, stony look and her swaying hypnotic music made her an instant darling of viewers. This film is a feast for the eyes with scenic locations, ethnic people, these Buddha temples and the naughty, naughty Mumtaz, who looks pretty attractive in their ethnic dress and dance skills. Of course, Dev is adorable and this is one of his commercially successful accomplishments. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest alive with carefully written scripts, arrangements, and intoxicating music. Like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand has dealt with the issue of adolescents adopting the habit of drug addiction, and the theory that they stem from troubled families and a disturbed childhood is quite plausible. A good entertainer, this film retains its freshness to this day!
