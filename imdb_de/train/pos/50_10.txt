My kids just stopped off this movie recently, and as things went on, my interest was aroused. I had to opt for the bowling league, so I had them recorded on the DVR for me so I could see the rest later. Well, I've just finished seeing it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after the bucket's weeping. It was an excellent movie, though I could almost feel the pain and agony of these girls. I would never have guessed the reason in a million years why Alissia had turned from this beautiful girl to an antisocial gothic. This was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I had the same pain that Alissia felt. I would not have searched for this movie, but I am sure glad that I saw him. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love a good drama or tear wanker.
