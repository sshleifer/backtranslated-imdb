I completely agree with what has been said so far. I remember that this documentary was one of the most amazing and informative I have ever seen. As already mentioned, I remember that I started watching and thought it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the story of the colony incredible, but I remember that the music was so much about its appeal. If I recall correctly, it was American whistles (similar to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I also searched for a copy. This should be necessary for everyone, but especially for schools. It should be re-published.
