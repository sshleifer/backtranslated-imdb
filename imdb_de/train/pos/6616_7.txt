This is a movie I've chosen because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often find that if a movie is not about a famous actor or an actress, but rather a story or a style, the movie can be seen as a work of art rather than as a showcase of the actors' ability to differentiate their styles. <br /> <br /> This movie is more about style than history. While I found the story interesting (a thriller that borrowed the story and atmosphere from movies like Blade Runner and many anime movies), sometimes it was a bit hard to follow, and it did not seem to me that everything could have come together. It was definitely a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese anime. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually, this film is a visual treat and in this sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like animations for adults or want to watch a movie that is different from most other movies right now. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the experience of the movie, but was a bit disappointed because it could have been better
