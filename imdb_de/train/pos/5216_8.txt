Erroll works for the Department of Public Safety and his job is to check out sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats the sex offenders. I'm not blaming him, but his boss is ready to retire, so Allison comes along. Erroll is now training her for his job and it's like a job shadowing. Allison is naive at first, but she does not know how dangerous she really is, and Erroll is all to blame. He begins to go too far with his obsession with finding a missing girl when it's not about a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent movie about a madman who crosses the borders and works outside his "scope." Erroll did a good job, but for the safety of Allison. It also has a good puzzle, and when I found out, there was more to it.
