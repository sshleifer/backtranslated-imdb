Jon Voight plays a guy named Joe. Joe is shaken by a haunting childhood. Because of his traumatic baptism, he has strong fear and hatred of religion. He quits his job as a dishwasher and becomes a hustler for wealthy people. He meets a woman named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two come remarkably close and soon can not live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso Joe has not told, and it could destroy the hope that they will survive the city together. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a heartbreaking and shocking portrait of lonely men who have nothing to lose. Their story is devastating, but ultimately important to the people. It's one of those movies where the characters are like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this movie is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see how the pedestrians in this movie treat them like filth, especially when we were one of those people. The film does not try to make you stumble. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle. It is not a pleasant and carefree lifestyle as portrayed in many Hollywood movies like MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, hard and ugly life, and it is sad that people have degraded themselves like Joe's character in this movie. What excites me most about this film was the fact that it came out in 1969 and has proven its worth. Today's audience will still be very important in this film, and will still love and appreciate it, just as critics and audiences made it everywhere in 1969 - a much honest, realistic, and effective way. Anyone who had sex before will know how humorous, awkward and scary it can be, and this movie is not afraid of all that. The gender in this movie may not be as vivid as it once was. X-Movies like MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO IN PARIS, and FRITZ THE CAT all seem amazingly tame, compared to the shocking things that people get today with an R rating. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem pretty strong, but they are certainly not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and people should be aware of that when watching this movie. The language used in the film, especially the word "fag", is used effectively and is not in vain. The violence is still very shocking, but it is once again necessary to portray the world of a hustler. I'm really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not outdated and still as influenced as 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope that he will continue to find an audience, because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not be forgotten so quickly. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both staggering and amazing to look at. They have never played such roles before and are completely different than usual. They will forget who plays them in minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful Score <br /> <br /> -Not old-fashioned or fussy, as many movies of this decade look like today <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and fast editing <br / > <br /> CONS: <br /> <br /> -For the mature spectators <br /> <br /> -The opening scenes are well done, but could only be a little bit stronger.
