I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was sometimes a little bit absent, but I liked how the story moved dramatically and seriously throughout the movie. This is the only movie I saw playing Verdone (the other was "Un sacco bello"), and I can see why the Italians find him tired, but he thinks he played his role as a loving father /> My downside to this movie was that I knew it was in Italy - somewhere in the middle or south, I suppose, but I felt there was no place. This film could be played in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think that it is important for movies to have a place where the audience has something to talk about. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies then I think you will enjoy this. It is not Fellini or Rossellini - it is not realism or neorealism. It's a funny story with serious moments that can really happen to any of us.
