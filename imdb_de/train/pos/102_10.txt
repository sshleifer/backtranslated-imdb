It was the first time I heard of this movie about 20 years ago, when I was a kid in elementary school (!). One day, I casually flipped through the encyclopedias in the classroom and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I do not remember), there were several stills for different movies, from mainstream to experimental, and one of them on the page was a still image for OffOn. It really fascinated me, as it stood out the most on the page (it was a still picture from the film of the scene with the eye on which other elements lay on top of each other). <br /> <br /> About 18 years later In the public library where I live, the entire 4-DVD set "Treasures of American Film Archives" of the National Film Preservation Foundation was available. So when I read the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I finally got to see the movie! After watching, it was not as if I expected it (it was more of an organic-looking movie, not that that was a bad thing, but I expected it to have an electronic aesthetic), but IMHO was still one considering the techniques used by Scott Bartlett to make the film, including manually cutting off the film itself and using video equipment for some of the movie scenes (filmed by a video monitor), which worried him more, lo-res look. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were groundbreaking in 1972. That's why he's still one of my favorite short films / experimental films a creative inspiration for me too ...
