Very light spoiler <br /> <br /> This film is (although it is only on TV) absolutely outstanding. I did not really pay attention to the differences in look or accent, so I can not really comment on that. The acting was so good that I had to pinch myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, that's NOT REALLY PASSED". As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talking, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they actually had that meeting. John's obvious comments and burns were just right with his character (especially in the restaurant!), As well as his depression, while Paul was very laid back and laid back. Both actors have done an excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. For every Beatles fan, it's a nasty experience. And prepare for some surprises!
