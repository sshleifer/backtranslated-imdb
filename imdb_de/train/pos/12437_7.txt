As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I have seen this film on DVD without much hope; I had even expected myself to turn to the remote in disgust for fifteen minutes. But instead, I really enjoyed this production, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and directors managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of a (bad) movie version of the books we all know so well. Instead, they focused on a phase in Modesty's life that is only referred to in the novels for production values ​​(and I'm not a student of cinematography!): Yes, the film was shot on a tight financial and time budget and may show that ... but does it harm the viewer? In that case, I do not think so. Instead, we get to know one of the greatest literary heroines in the world and get a taste of their abilities. <br /> <br /> In terms of casting: Because we are the only people in a foreign area who are really important, Modesty and (maybe)) are Professor Praise. For me they were absolutely believable. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine, brought Modesty's attitude and coolness to the screen. Her technique (used as a martial art), but above all, embodied the integrity that is at the heart of the Modesty Blaise canon. OK, so we all know that this movie was produced to meet the claim of Miramax on the Modesty Blaise character, it was made quickly and cheaply, BUT ... I can not wait to see the next production of this series from these producers as long as they keep the core values ​​and characterizations of the original stories!
