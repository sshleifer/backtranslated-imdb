Although I saw this movie years ago, its influence has never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His fear of not being able to stop death is palpable. Everyone in the cast is astonishing from Sutherland, who tries to accommodate him and give the police the opportunity to coordinate their efforts for the troubled citizen x. Every day, when we're bombarded with stories about mass murderers, I think of this movie and the hard work people do trying to find the killers.
