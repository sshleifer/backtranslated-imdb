I remember being scared of the movie blood when I was younger and getting less and less until I was enough, since I am sure that many other viewers have become it, so that the one in the Last years produced curse of bloody films entertained did not scare me or let me squirm. "The Dentist" has reversed that. <br /> <br /> The setup seems to be simple: A mentally unstable dentist causes chaos on the insides of the mouths and possibly also the body. A clever twist, however, is that the dentist is the protagonist of the movie. Instead of being a one-dimensional villain with no clear motivation, his development is the most complete of all characters, and he is very human and believable. The onlooker feels compassionate for him and his victims, and instead of hoping that justice will come to him, I hoped he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life. <br /> What a Horror movie really "makes" is the violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can imagine. First, the film has a ton of tension, the modern Gore films rather missing. In a scene () the dentist is emotionally disturbed and has to see a small patient for the first time. If he reaches into the child's mouth, you hope that the encounter for the dentist and the child ends without injury. I will not spoil what happens. Second, when the bladder comes, it hits all the worst, tortuous nerves. Again, I will not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> As a movie you've never heard of, it has flaws. Most important, it is only for horror fans. As another reviewer has mentioned, when it takes place over a period of only a few days, we have no background to the characters. And the tension comes off a bit in the end. The fact that we even want to know a background about the characters is proof of how good they are, and the bulk of the film is solid enough to fill any of the small tension holes. <br /> <br /> It's strange, after years of getting used to the movie, to suddenly cover my eyes when looking at blood. "The Dentist" made me anxious and totally uncomfortable, and for that it deserves my full approval.
