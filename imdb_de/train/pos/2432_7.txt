I remember Casper comics, but no cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable. I do not know, but in my advanced age, I look at this very short animated Casper from yesterday. After that, I was shocked to read the user comments here. Did people miss the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts who like to go out every night and scare the C - P of all. "He sees no future in it," says the narrator here. Instead, he goes one evening into the rural part of the city, unintentionally scares some animals and finds no friends. It makes him cry until a little fox roars and befriends him. The two become friends, but soon the fox runs for his life with a running fox hunt. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have all mentioned what's going on, so I'll go into that too. The fox is killed by hounds (not shown) and Casper is in tears for losing "the only friend I ever had". But nobody mentions the happy end of this story. "Ferdie", the fox, becomes a ghost like Casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments "they lived happily ever after." Both characters look overjoyed. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about that? This is a beautiful story with a happy ending.
