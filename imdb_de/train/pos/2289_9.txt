I am a pretty pedestrian person with a simple taste. However, I occasionally try to raise the bar for my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the movie. I liked it so much that I got my own band so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally flashy movie. I saw it as a big question to the spectator: what is the depth of duty that one can assume that one can accept should accept? Of course this is an important question for me as a military member. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
