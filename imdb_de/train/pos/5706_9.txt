Had this movie been shot just a few years later, I would have cut the score by one or two points because the sound quality was rather poor. Sometimes the movie seemed to be a silent movie during the intermediate scenes (normal ambient noise is missing). But given the year 1931 and a French film, this is quite forgivable. Especially since this is also the case in later French films - at this time the sound problems should have been completely solved (as in L'Atalante from 1934) This is a cute little film about a missing lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search there are many little playful songs that you can not help but like. A beautiful charming movie All in all.
