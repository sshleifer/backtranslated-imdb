The attraction of antique films like this is that you see a real picture of life more than 100 years ago. Here many leave a factory, all are now dead, and none of them knows how big the invention they made before. I was shocked that a reviewer who calls this film boring today is being read as home video, and at least one other person mistakenly identified it as the first movie ever made (it was the first movie to be shot at 16 Frames per second instead of with the film was rotated) then normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see is that a lot of people are filming out of a building and passing home from the cinematograph on the way home, but this is a curiosity for dozens of reasons, not least one of the few This was the first film by the Lumi√©re brothers, which probably had a greater impact on the development of cinema than any other individuals or groups of people in history.
