This is a funny movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star signing a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit Restaurants. The contract contains all possible demeaning clauses, eg. For example, force Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not very convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yes!) Is tasked by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly to the contract. This is a funny movie in which Burt proves he is not too proud. I like this!
