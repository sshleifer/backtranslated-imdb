Let me first say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less prudent to acknowledge this fact, but it is noteworthy to ponder the kind of utter aversion that this little harmless film produces by some people. For me, like most of them, before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was really baffled, moved, inspired. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most memorable emotions and emotions you can imagine. It's impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the inspirational feelings I have with it. <br /> <br /> The film works as a combination of two fragile souls who are getting to know each other. It's very intelligent and inspiring, not so much as a conversation is necessarily linked to the next or the meaning of the themes of Jesse and Celine, but rather the small nuances, the perfectly articulated answers that trigger each other. It captures an honest, romantic and yet fleeting human emotion that begins to bloom in the magnificently sublime Viennese milieu. It convinces us that their fleeting relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt they will not meet again. <br /> <br /> The simple comments of RockytheBear and the users below are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> See it and it can change your lifestyle.
