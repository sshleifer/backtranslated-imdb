This video is so funny, it makes everything else of Eddie Murphy very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just shows how good that really is). To be honest, I do not think I've ever laughed about anything, including Naked Gun and the bargearse that's rarely seen. This show is amazing, though it must be said that it is certainly filled with a word beginning with F and four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with M), but it did not bother me. See it, the funniest thing I've ever seen, and probably the funniest thing you've ever seen.
