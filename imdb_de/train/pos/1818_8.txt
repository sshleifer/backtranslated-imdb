I saw this movie when I was about eight, and I liked it, but it was not until I saw it again at the age of 13 that I really understood it the way it is. A cartoon about a criminal dog with a real gold heart "adopted" a little girl to use for her talent to talk to animals. The dog-star Charlie B. Barkin is murdered by his formal business partner Carface (who, by the way, is absolutely diabolical). His soul then goes to a place other than heaven, only to find a golden clock that is truly his lifetime. Charlie, the devious but lovable Kad he steals and rewinds, sends him back to Earth. Back on Earth, Charlie seeks revenge on the evil Carface. So he meets the young Anne-Marie, the lonely little orphan who can talk to animals that wants to cheat Charlie for her talent, to return to his enemy Carface. But the rogue Charlie actually cares about the young Anne-Marie and his plans, and he has to decide to do the right thing after Anne-Marie has figured out what her "best friend" Charlie really deserves for her money and money better dog casino. Now he has to rescue her from the dreaded Carface. I love this movie at the age of 22. The idea and the plot are really and original different from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog once plays the role of the villain. Carface was even better than the sequel to All Dogs to Heaven. In this picture, he seemed quite skeptical of his role as a villain.
