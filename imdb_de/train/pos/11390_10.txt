The story and the music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as well as Levant, Guetary, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good lead actress. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Nevertheless, the plot moves well with the famous (and rightly so) ballet. Oh, the colors, the iridescent reds, blue, green and yellow. Not to mention the beige ones. ; ) I admire the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (costumes in black and white) and the always brilliant ballet. See it in any case, and enjoy it, because although it's not the best, it's MARVELOUS. But do not forget to forget about this other Gene Kelly Musical with the 20-year-old girl, who was catapulted into retirement soon afterwards.
