Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the longest-established craps game in New York, and he needs $ 1,000 to secure a new location. Convinced of his contradictions, he relies on Sky Masterson, the town's tallest scooter, that he can not court missionary Sarah Brown. "Guys and Dolls (1955)" is such a great musical because it skilfully blends the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, the pedestrian masses move in rhythm, stopping and starting as if they are reacting to the scenes behind the scenes. Even the walking movements themselves are stylized and angular midway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering play of Art Deco colors and movements, a fantasy world so completely out of touch with reality that even the underground gambling business and criminal brawls are absolutely ingenious. <br /> <br /> When I wrote this review, I just received the news that Jean Simmons died at the age of 80 years. This was the first time I had seen her in a movie for the first time, but she was dazzled I from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually suppressed Sarah comes out of her bowl after an alcohol frenzy in Havana and lets go with a delightfully playful interpretation of "If I Were A Bell". Although both Simmons and Brando were not singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to emphasize their vocals, claiming, "They may not sound so good, but you are the least." Despite Goldwyn's respectfulness, the couple is good at carrying whole musical numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same childlike liveliness that Audrey Hepburn could have brought into that role, and Brando radiates such self-assurance and charisma that it does not matter that his singing voice is not quite there.
