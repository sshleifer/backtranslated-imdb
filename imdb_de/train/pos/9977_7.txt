SPOILERS BY: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it's definitely a pretty adrenalin-pumping ride. I definitely thought that it was worth at least a rating of 7. <br /> <br /> Maybe I liked it because I did not see the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this one, it will be the strongest fans. People who have not seen the original version and therefore have little to compare. This was not a masterpiece, but I was pretty busy with it and wanted to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that I liked. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was great and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really had to be outstanding, and so was he. This was a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it was made for television. I had no idea that this was the case when I saw it. It definitely seemed to be a big movie, and I never thought that this was not a big-screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very exciting. I'm not into action movies, but I've been involved in this. Plus, it was much more than an action movie that had drama, mystery, a love story, and quirky people, no matter which direction you were heading. (I did not even recognize Priestly.) And it touched me. This was not a great movie, but it can be viewed. <br /> <br /> And then there is the end. It's a big hit and if someone was involved in the story up to this point, it's very difficult not to get fixed in the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The consequence was that Kowalkski survived and although I am very skeptical, HOW that would be possible, it is a movie and realism is not an ingredient that always plays a role in mixing a movie. <br /> <br /> So I have to say, I found the ending incredibly unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative way, which I usually dislike, but for some reason can almost be forgiven in this movie. Granted, many things were just props for the plot (were the rogues perhaps more stereotypical?). But the creators were right, even if they did a lot wrong. However, I can admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original would hate this version, because although I did not see the original, I saw many original films that I loved with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually a sequel.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of such high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a street version of "Legends Of The Fall" and "Thelma And Louese"? I certainly felt the touch of both films (both of which I'm a fan). But I do not think that was a great movie. It was better than average for me, but not at all great. But it was a gripping, adrenaline-charged, touching movie with superb casting of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
