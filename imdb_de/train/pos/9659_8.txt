'Presque Rien' is a beautiful portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. It's both a stereotype and a sermon. It's a wonderfully naturalistic movie, excellently played, shot with a feel for the coastal city where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If anything, it's almost too realistic, since conventional action has little to offer, just scenes from one's life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tensions is less important than in such a subtly drawn world. "Presque Rien" may not be the most exciting movie ever made; But his simple humanism is good for him compared to the preconceived solemn or bigoted views that often hinder the treatment of this subject.
