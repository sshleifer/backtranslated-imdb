I have just seen a press screening of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that I see all my favorite actors in a movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was nice to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together. I think her chemistry in front of the camera is a direct result of their time together outside the camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly so) Bret Ratner's piece ... Without betraying too much, I simply say that there's a surprise that will leave you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good together and you actually had the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Both the Chris Cooper segment and the Ethan Hawke segment were full of surprises that are realistic and similar to those I made with the big apple. Overall, the movie is a great place to meet for a date ... especially if you love the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to wait for the next in the Cities of Love.
