The good earth is a great movie !!! Everyone has to see it ... It shakes and is very heartwarming. It's about increasing value building on perseverance, humility and love for the family ... History can be linked to our lives today, especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way we respond to such a problem is very important. If a person is not strong enough to face such problems, they can remain defenseless and useless. I am very pleased with how the characters justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions have captivated the audience. The movie may have been shot in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want to stop. That really makes it great! There should be a reissue for this very nice movie.
