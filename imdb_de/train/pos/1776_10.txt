I hated the first episode of this 1999 protesting hippies so much that I avoided the rest. However, when it appeared on "The Paramount Comedy Channel," I fully saw it and found it, to my surprise, absolutely weird (Motto: Never Judge a Comedy Series in the First Week)! <br /> <br /> "Hippies" plays the role of Simon Pegg in 1969 as "Ray Purbbs", the publisher of an "Oz" -like U-magazine called "Mouth". His friends are the feminist Jill, the relaxed Alex and the half-witted Hugo. In the late 1960s, young people were incredibly optimistic that they could change the world by printing magazines that nobody read. Instead of mocking the naivety of the hippies, 'Hippies' is loving. Arthur Mathews 'scripts cheekily parody some of the icons of that era - "Hair," "Woodstock," "The Graduate," even the infamous "Oz" obscenity test of the early' 70s. Excellent services from the cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' strangely reminded me of the Richard O'Sullivan character of 'Man About The House'. It's a shame that there never was a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed "hippies", try it. Once you have left the gloomy opener behind, you will be looking forward to something!
