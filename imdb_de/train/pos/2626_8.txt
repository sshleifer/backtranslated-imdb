"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's funniest non-theatrical release. I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it for many years. I remember the first time I saw that I had no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by this interesting and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not bad at all, there were some issues: the lack of a good script and poor characterizations that affected the otherwise good movie. Anyway, it's nice to see The personalities of Timon and Pumbaa are blossoming back to the way we (or certainly me) loved them in this movie; In "Simba's Pride" they were really annoying and I did not like the series "Timon and Pumbaa" either. <br /> <br /> This film could have been quite a stupid movie, but luckily the filmmakers did not accept that, and turned instead to make this film extremely funny at times. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy alone. The result is pretty good. There are two new songs that are catchy, and two new characters, Timon's Mom (voiced by recognizable margin Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, who are fun. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is touchingly portrayed. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which could easily have been done (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there anything that distracts this image from the 10 votes of me? Yes there is. Although fortunately they do not have much impact, I will mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first movie are used in this movie. It was strange to integrate the old scenes with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During the climax, some jokes become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. Storywise, this is Timon's story, and although the filmmakers try to integrate his story with Simba, the script sometimes feels a bit rushed. <br /> <br /> But these details do not affect this otherwise amusing movie. It's the only really acceptable sequel to Disney that should be included in every movie collection.
