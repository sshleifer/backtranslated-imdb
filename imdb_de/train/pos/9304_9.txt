This movie is great. Easy. It's rare that you find a comedy with levels, and this is a damn good example. When I saw this movie for the first time when the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked, "Did you just understand that?" For these doubters look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! Look at the different characters, each jostling for position, and if you do not see anything else, you see the connection between the healing of Vick and the path through the movie. It's all in Vicks head! The opening line about Vicks world. The final scene with the camera in Vicks head and inside a whole universe! Totally quotable, wonderful comic gangster, beautiful, beautiful, gorgeous!
