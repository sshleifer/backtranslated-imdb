A critical and financial flop at the first release, the critics have turned around and said that this film is one of the best of the director. A La Ronde-like feel for the film develops quickly as the guys from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter, and Blaine Novak) continue to fall in love with some of the most bizarre and beautiful women seen in the film (Audrey Hepburn) and fall in love, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was edited or rewritten on the day of filming, giving the film a breezy feel. Ben Gazzara is excellent as a chief investigator following Audrey Hepburn after dropping singer Colleen Camp and seeing taxi driver Patti Hansen next door. John Ritter awkwardly follows Dorothy Stratten and instantly falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has a few girls he hunts (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great performances from a Supurb Cast. Outstanding are Audrey Hepburn (she has no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead role) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer Christy Miller. It's a pleasure to see her fire her lines in a Rat-a-Tat-Tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
