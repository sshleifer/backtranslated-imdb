After reading some of the other comments here, I expected something really terrible, but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not so good. I think some people remember with more affection than they deserved, but apart from the chases and Daisy Duke's legs, the scripts were weak and badly traded. The Duke guys were too smart and hip for hillbilly pants, the shrunken boss Hog was too cocky to be angry, and Rosco was hyperactive at every moment of the moment. It's amazing that the series actually lasted so long because she had no action during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you look at this movie on its own, not as a direct comparison to the TV series you remember, that's not bad at all. The real star, of course, is General Lee. The chases and stunts are superb and that's what D.O.H. everything is about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and together with Seann William Scott as cousin Bo, they make this film in a funny way like Dumb-And-Dumber, who has never reached the TV series. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a total banger than Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved boss Hog and an M.C. Gainey makes a credibly kinky Rosco P. Coltrane as he should have always been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like slapstick humor and crazy car stunts, you would not do that movie anyway, because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun car action movie with some good laughs that are not too stressful for the brain, then head to this enjoyable open minded game.
