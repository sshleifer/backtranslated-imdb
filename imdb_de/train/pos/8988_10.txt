To say that Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use therapy is mild. In Dig! Having won the Grand Jury Prize in Sundance, we watch him and his band for over seven years, while ex-boyfriends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols fall to similar size (anyway, a mobile phone ad). <br /> <br /> What increases dig! above his contemporaries is the immense, almost biblical comic tragedy that is being delivered: a depressingly honest essay on art versus commerce and compromise. Although Newcombe is an "avid, bloody genius" and has proven to be the only talented, if restless, musician. He is far more talented than his rival Dandy's Courtney Taylor, who tells the story. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper and Taylor's Peter Fonda. <br /> <br /> Even sadder, Taylor seems to recognize this, as shown by his tired, self-loathing voice: he knows his band has won the fight - but at what cost? In truth, they were sold out, making indie-lite records, keeping their teeth clean and probably double-brushing their hair at bedtime - earning record deals and a big touring coach. And throw all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in the dirt, is constantly knocked down, beats other band members on the stage, kicks the head in the head - and is last seen in Dig! to have been eaten away by the police and to have lost the right to see his child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about the subculture of rock were staged by women: Penelope Spheeris's 'The Decline Of Western Civilization' and this one? an instant classic at the moment it was released.
