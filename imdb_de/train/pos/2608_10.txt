The last season of Roseanne was a roller coaster ride from Crazy. This last episode does exactly what a previous comment says and tells us that, as far as we could have thought, we know the characters we do not know. Roseanne returns to season one and tells us that the show was her portrayal of her life. She says in this last episode that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married opposing wives in real life, and Dan died when she brought him to life. As events happened in her life, she changed them in her writing. Do not we all wish we could do that? Do not we all have a moment in which we wish we could just use an eraser and change ourselves at will. That's what she did with the entire episode. And for another comment, I would say that I do not feel betrayed, the family was really in my head, it just changed the way events took place in their lives. An A + end of an A + show !!!!
