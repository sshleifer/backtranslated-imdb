Dominion Tank Police is an exercise in conflicting filmmaking. The action across the four parts combines mindless action, slapstick humor, touching humanity, and philosophical questions that make you think. It's hard to believe there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode. A must-see movie for those who like anime.
