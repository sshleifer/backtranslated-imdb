I had seen red-haired lady when it appeared, and did not remember that it was valuable. The truth is that the screenplay, despite its base in a true story, is stupid and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporters of the '30s and' 40s lays the foundation for the delicate, intelligent work of the ever-underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who as always is the best of the picture. What an actor! He has never won an Oscar, but he is in good company with Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
