I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid, and it's the only time in my life that I can remember putting my hands in front of my eyes and face on a particular scene. I remembered once again with a disappointment with my university friends and promptly bought it with much reluctance on video. I can add it (to my surprise, I only found it in the US when it was made in England!), When I saw it Again, my reaction was, and to my surprise, almost the same, with terrible horror and fear and never my heart beat so much. This, in my opinion, is the SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem to be tame in comparison and a bit of pony and trap, forgive the pun. But what is amazing is the power of this movie. When I saw this with about twenty colleagues, I have never heard so many screams, even men! Even the sight of the video brings me the fear of God in front of this one scene and I have the feeling that I will never go back in the dark alone !!!!
