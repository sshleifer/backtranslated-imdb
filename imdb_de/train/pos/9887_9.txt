"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely talked about. The film exists only in a low quality VHS format. It's a shame that this movie did not get a DVD release. "Erendira" is breathtaking and beautiful with its magical-realistic images. "Erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 years of loneliness". Erendira constantly dreams and accidentally burns her grandma's house. Her evil granny, played by Irene Papas, forces her to prostitution to pay for the damage. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the theme sounds harsh, the film does not exploit sexuality. It's a mature artistic way. The movie also has some amazing costumes. Some of the surrealistic aspects of the film that stand out the most are origami birds that turn into real birds, and a golden orange with a diamond in the middle. Erendira is an amazing movie that even creates humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD release. As you would say in Espanol: "It muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
