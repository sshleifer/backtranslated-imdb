Thanks to Warner Archive, I can see this mammoth variety again, throwing everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub is present, though.) This movie gives everyone who was under Warner's contract time on screen. If some of the artists seem to be unknown to some, that's because they were big in the quiet days and most of the popularity of the talkies fade away. There are also some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era. You will be most impressed by Winnie Lightner, who plays two numbers. There is also the French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-row Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which was restored for this version. It's really beautiful and there are Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there's the massive "Lady Luck" finale, which lasts almost fifteen minutes. This is really an epic of the early talkie era. Any old movie fan will love that.
