You have to see it to believe it! The directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield did a really great job. It's a 10 out of 10, so I can not believe other users of this web rated it as bad, unless they just wanted a normal movie with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentary is a great way to wake us up to save our beautiful planet. After all, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," which consists mainly of long monologues, painful, and "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have suggested. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to miss the earth.
