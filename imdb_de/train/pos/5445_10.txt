I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and thought it was very funny. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that it was written by the generally reliable John Hughes shows that you can expect at least some funny dialogues. (Incidentally, I also think that Weird Science is pretty good, which was also written by Hughes at lightning speed.) <br /> <br /> The film looks very bright and uses all the primary colors - red, yellow etc - what it is makes it look unique. The cast is pretty good, too. The prudish Bunny Packard and the devilishly obsessed Delores Salk are a peculiarity. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly a bit dated, but I personally prefer it to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
