I saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Great writing and directing, excellent and credible actor-to-player interaction and great comic timing. This film touches topics that are universal family and separation. As a result, I see that the European, Asian and American audiences all find similarities between this film and its own life. <br /> <br /> If all that is not enough, this has the potential to be that best underground date movie of the year ... someone will distribute it in the US! <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you, Maria Flom! It's really a great movie.
