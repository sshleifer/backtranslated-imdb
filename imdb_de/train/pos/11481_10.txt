The school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrible attack on their high school. As they begin the deadly countdown to their latest act of revenge, they begin a video diary to explain their feelings and record their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar movie called "Elephant". Why am I bringing this up? To compare the two films of course. I have to say, although I liked "Elephant", this movie is much better. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, it's a different story, in the spirit of "Cloverfield," "Blair Witch Project," and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the movie even better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what convinced me was the movie's willingness to show the "other side of the story". You get to know these two shooters as opposed to "Elephant". I actually looked after one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. In this movie, you actually feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing, because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real people with logic and reasons for their actions. You can understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film is emotionally exciting and very insistent and much better than "Elephant".
