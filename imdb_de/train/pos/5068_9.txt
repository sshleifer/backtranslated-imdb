This movie is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in Canada in the 1930s. I thought it was as exciting and hearty as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It engages late in Gray Owls life and follows it through its most turbulent and influential time. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who advocates the plight of the overcrowded Beaver. He also predicts the decline in natural landscapes and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to hear. <br /> <br /> The casting of Pierce Brosnan looks rather strange, but it is not unheard of. Anyone who wants to argue this point must first see the movie to understand it. Brosnan does a wonderful job, as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress, whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful landscapes or environmental reasons. It is a movie for families, but children under 10 (depending on their maturity) have difficulty following the plot.
