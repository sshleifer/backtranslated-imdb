Edmund Burke said that "all evil is good for me, nothing to do." Hollywood often gives us rubbish because not enough families see high quality movies. This film was an uplifting story about the loss and restoration of the faith. It had no violence, no fornication and did not deserve PG rating. The western landscape was well turned and some of the views were just breathtaking. Actors were a bit young for their role but otherwise believable and talented. The music score was too loud and in some places the dialogue drowned out completely. I'm rarely surprised anymore by film ends, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes the good guys win and they win by honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message and would recommend it to the whole family.
