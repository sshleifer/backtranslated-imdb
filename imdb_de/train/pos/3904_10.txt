In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen. I immediately became a fan of Eddie after seeing Dress to Kill, but I have to say that this is his best work. I would say, however, if you ever got the chance to see him live in any case. It is worth it! <br /> <br /> Mostly after seeing a stand-up routine a few times, the jokes start to grow old. But I have to say, I've seen this show so many times that I've literally memorized the whole thing (which, yes, I know, is kind of sad), but any joke makes me laugh anyway. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never grow old for me. I own it and always watch it when I need a good laugh.
