If I did not know better, it almost seems to be staged, but it was not like that. It was perfectly decorated, and how they got all the material is incredible! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well put together in this documentary, and the classic footage they received has made this unfortunate classic. But the story in the movies should be a must for any American or any person affected by the tragedy of 9/11.
