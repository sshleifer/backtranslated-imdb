The Tattooed Stranger was one of the rare B-Movies that BBC2 presented over Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this case, a man walking with his dog in Central Park comes to an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman. She was shot and the police tried to identify her with a tattoo as the main message. After the killer has been identified, he is discovered and shot at the end of the shootout. <br /> <br /> Most of the film was filmed on location in and around New York so we can see some areas of the city. We do not usually see, especially the back alleys. <br /> <br /> Mostly unknown people are in the cast and John Miles receives the top billing. <br /> <br /> The Tattooed Stranger is worth it. Excellent, but rather indistinct. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
