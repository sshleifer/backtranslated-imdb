Very rarely do you come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer's director has not only taken on the challenge of leading his own work, but is also giving a funny performance as a wicked roommate. The script takes an interesting look at the plight of the struggling writer and mixes so much comedy into the writer's desolate world that you can not help but devote himself to the character of Ernie. Very funny stuff. Despite the low budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. He does not play around when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what he expects next. This guy can make people laugh and think; this is something special.
