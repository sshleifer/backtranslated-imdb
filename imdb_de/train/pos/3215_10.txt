That was excellent. Touching, action packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars. This film is the story of an outdated soldier who learns that life is more than just a soldier and defending people who learn that there is time to fight. I cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good paperwork for an action movie, and the plot was appropriate and pretty solid. The end was not curvy, but it was still excellent. If you like fleeing New York or looking for the underdog, this movie is for you. It was not an inappropriate amount of violence and violence, it was not difficult to observe in this regard. Something for everyone.
