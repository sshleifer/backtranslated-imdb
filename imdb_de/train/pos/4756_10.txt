This is one of the most enchanting episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some funny dialogues and funny characters to break the suspense of some scary moments. There's the usual blonde vamp "dancer" (what about Serling's fondness for this kind of character so she keeps coming up in various episodes?) And other different characters, but it's Jack Elam's "old man" who's the one Show completely steals. I think this is the funny, carefree version of "The Monsters Are in Maple Street" - or maybe a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of "The Thing". In another note: I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually did other things - he looked familiar - but it seems like "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two TV credits in his name.
