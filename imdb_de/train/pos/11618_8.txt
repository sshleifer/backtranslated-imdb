Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The dream team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great storyline. A great turn. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's biggest movies, apart from "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". That could be the best. The plot is one of the best things in the movie and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a struggling hotel manager, returns to LA with a late Red Eye. She does not know that she was followed by Jackson Ripner, Alias ​​Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They drink a few drinks and sit together on the plane. Later, he reveals to her that he is an assassin sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security inherited from Lisa's hotel. And what does that have to do with Lisa? Well, she would have to move his room to the top suite so they could bomb him if Ripner did not murder her father (Brian Cox). The twist and bringing of the story really adds the extra to Zing and the supporting characters and side jokes really add to that. Overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth a visit. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
