, , But it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. I really want to own the movie because I saw it for the first time because I'm a bus driver and drove that model bus at the time I saw this movie. I only remember (during his murder trial about 15 years later) that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only remember that he was the driver and the bus was shot up and driven wild. I've searched everywhere for this movie since I saw it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I usually do not watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV program and looking at the beginning (though out of focus), I stuck with everything.
