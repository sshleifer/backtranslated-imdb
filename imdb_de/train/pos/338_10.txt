I saw this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival and met the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are lively and open-minded New Yorkers. In Amsterdam, the movie was titled Keep the River on Your Right, which made the sensational aspect of cannibalism a little less prominent. Equally important was the loving and gay relationship that Tobias Schneebaum had with anthropologist members of his group. His reunification at the age of almost 80 years and the inevitable departure were very moving. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
