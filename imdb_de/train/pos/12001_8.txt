I do not know what movie some of these people saw, but they must have seen a different "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" than the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both well done and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth it. It is clear from the beginning that the film was created with great care. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is good for Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are presented with taste and awe. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend to watch this movie.
