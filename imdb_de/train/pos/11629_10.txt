Red Eye is an exciting film by Wes Craven, the inventor of Freddy Kreuger. Wes Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After attending her grandmother's funeral, she decides to take the red-eyed flight. While waiting, she meets this man named Jack Rippner (how is that for fffrreeaakkyy?) And they become friends, so to speak. Ironically, both sit side by side in this plane. Then the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for those weak hearts that do not like exciting horror movies, we can say that it's possible they pee in their pants. This is an excellent example of bone vibration production. Wes Craven was fine with this movie. He chose the right performers, like Rachel McAdams, a smart, sexy girl who knows what she's doing, and is careful when she plays in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the scary and frightening actor who can cool his bones in his amazing acting as a bad character in this movie, and his face can really widen his eyes. Wes Craven has done a great job and I hope he makes more films like this.
