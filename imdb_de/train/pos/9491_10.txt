Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of Condor, or JFK, but he's certainly no worse, and sometimes even better, than these classic genreists. The action takes place in the fictional Western state where the fictional president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president was killed by a single shooter. A man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - believes that there is still something to investigate, and the movie begins. This film is not about exact theories, but about the whole relationship structure between government and society in today's world. Such a movie could only be shot in the 70s, but it will never lose its topicality. Also, it's even a bit scary to know exactly how the oracles are. 10 out of 10.
