Documentations of this kind are often very opinionated. This film seems to take out all opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad to see under what conditions these poor people have to work. This movie shows great the ugly side of sweat shops. The movie Mardi Gras: Made in China was a great way to show the world how petty pearls for a celebration can affect the lives of so many people in another country film for an English class in which we spent our time with have talked about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eradicate them, and this movie has helped make the subject roll. It was a great, very informative movie, and I would recommend everyone to see it, it somehow opens your eyes.
