One day I stumbled upon this movie on television. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel that is not known for good movies. This was not less than good. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy who was inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends are building rockets. His father is not happy about his sons new hobby and would rather let him be a miner or go to college with a football scholarship like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. Maybe a bit too predictable, but that's fine, because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. It's an important part, but where this is obviously the inner action, the action focuses between the characters. The story is good. It has some clich√©s, but that's fine. It is based on actual events, so you can not just omit these stereotypes. The characters are really good. Where history goes downhill, the characters are released and manage to uplift the action and quality of the movie. You get to know these characters and get sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50s style are thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the movie very well. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper as John Hickam are good. For the rest of the cast they are good too. All in all, this makes a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm glad I got this movie. After seeing it, I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that, it would probably be more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie everyone can believe in. It's a kind of feel-good movie. Not that bad!
