Well, I'll be honest: It's not exactly a sholay. But you can not get a sholay every week. In fact, one could see in this film clear signatures of "Not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991). As with most "inspired" films, however, this film was well inspired, well crafted and well done. As usual, Nana Patekar exaggerates his hysterics, but everyone else is commendable. Especially about Dipti Naval: I have seen her after a long time, but she has lost none of her grace. In fact, she has done much better results than I last saw. Another Bollywood star who seems to get more beautiful as he gets older. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice watch.
