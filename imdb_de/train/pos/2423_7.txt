Once in a lifetime it means that once a Hoodlum, always a Hoodlum, and nobody in vain enters or leaves "The Life". Neighborhood deer in New York are selling drugs and committing scams because they can not make it in the legitimate world, perhaps because they have a record or are using drugs or because they are just lazy. This simple story with a few twists about mostly despicable characters manages to gain sympathy for the main actors of the audience because of their loyalty and compassion. The film was written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays 20/20 Mike (all nicknames). He is based on his play "Riff Raff". It feels like a game from start to finish, especially in the longest scene where the three main players compete against each other to decide who to trust. Often the dialogue comes very fast, much faster than on stage, and I think it's the film's biggest mistake. As flashbacks throughout the film are mixed poems from the street, a kind of Iambik pentameter rap that is violent and evokes the world this film reveals. Poetry makes it difficult to reject these men, those scoundrels who kill each other, cheat and cheat, as unworthy of our attention or under our contempt. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not just how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons we all do. One is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last suffers from conscience, while the audience is surprised or even laughed at the irony of the executioners, who demand that he should hang in the gallows and tell jokes in the middle of his death.
