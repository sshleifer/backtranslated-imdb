Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who spontaneously travel to Thailand and end up in jail after being drugged in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to become a serious and moving film, like "Return to Paradise," but instead, the film decided to focus less on the girls' situation and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are performing well, and the movie is much more about the interaction between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, questioning and testing their friendship, and ultimately, the friendship To sacrifice . This film decides not to delve too deeply into the politics or even the rigors of prison life (which gets a little glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues. <br /> <br /> and some parts that just do not seem believable or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. And outside the prison walls we hardly have a sense of life. Bill Pullman plays the supposedly sloppy lawyer who actually has a heart of gold. In short, this should have been a much darker movie than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I liked it. The drama was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the story had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
