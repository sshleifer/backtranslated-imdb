Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has been left in the incompetent hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, he simply criticizes everything that he does not like personally, d. H. Movies with country music are panning because "I do not like country music!" and kids movies get a standard "Do not watch it now, wait for it to appear on DVD and lend it to your kids!" Roeper may be an idiot, but in another area. The weekly guests 'sit' better for Ebert, but who wants to pick a daisy in the middle of a cow's wing? All in all, it's the only show in town and that alone makes it worth seeing. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you can too! It is your mind and your thoughts that we long for. Do whatever is necessary to free the usurper from his self-declared throne.
