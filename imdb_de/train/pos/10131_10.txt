In the very first episode of Friends, which aired on September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Get A Roommate", a song is played while Rachel sits in the window at the end of the show. Need someone knows the artist or the song's title It seems like it's a great song ... I'd like to get a copy of it Thanks for the help I'm looking for the album / CD it's on so I can buy it . <br /> <br /> I have the shows to buy and enjoy this show over and over again, it just seemed believable ... Thank you so much for the many entertainment lessons you have done over the years to have.
