I saw it at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my friend. We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong pictures. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short time. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this film is about a young girl being visited by a demon who offers herself to support her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise in the end that hit me unprepared. This tends in the direction of the Gothic. I would very much like to see it as a full feature film. - Carrie
