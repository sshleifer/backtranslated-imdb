Wow, Praise IMDb and Google, for over 15 years I've been trying to remember the name of this awesome movie. Slaughter up, man! Hells, yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a storyline and actors and Yadda Yadda Yadda because you all know what's going on. That's why you're here anyway. What I will do, however, is the beautiful memory of this 80s D-Movie Slasher Joint of the 80s these horror movies. Would he be interested in seeing his children watching with him? At this young age, I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this movie stayed with me. I have not seen it since then, but until today I remember the most ridiculous kills in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Gets electrocuted. Or the guy is drowned in a pool for enlightenment. Come on! My personal favorite but ... the exploding stomach of spoiled beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie in which one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, about 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? Then his belly explodes? What!? And this great line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic crap all the way. I mean, I look back now almost 20 years later and laugh about it. But when I was 7 years old, I was afraid of death. That fool's hat (or was it a mask?), Which the murderer ransacked, drove me crazy! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a crappy movie. But for reasons of nostalgia and humor reasons, this film receives from me 9 out of 10 points. Stay up late every night, and hope to see it on the same Late Late Late movie show, or look for a VHS copy and dust off your VCR.
