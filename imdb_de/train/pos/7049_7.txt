In this satire of commercialization and "ease" of the war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, an assassin who was sent to "Turaqistan" to eliminate Omar Sharif, who runs some oil deals that cause trouble for the former US Vice President. In addition, Hauser must juggle with his fake position as a fair maker, wedding for the pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and the curious liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei) technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The spectacle (at least the Main characters) was good, as expected. Some of John Cusack's dialogues were obviously not written for him, as he often found it uncomfortable to say so. , , maybe it's unrealistic. Joan has shown a great and often funny performance. Marisa Tomei, although I've never been a big fan of her, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was pretty awful. They needed an attractive pop star from the Middle East (or Russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be). Unfortunately, they went with her to 0 for 3. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, writing at the points seemed a bit stiff and inappropriate, especially with John Cusack's dialogue. Not much, but some. The story has been a bit ridiculous at times, which is satanic to a certain point in order, but it has taken it to a whole new level. Fortunately, the Cusacks and Tomei maintain a relatively cool, calm demeanor, and that's a pleasant mix of the movie's craziness and the actors' prudence. Joshua Seftel, who had previously done a drought of real credit to his name, has done a good job with a fairly broad-based movie. He handled the small budget ($ 10 million) very well and expanded so much that it works a lot more. Seftel also managed to fuse the humor of the story. , , with the painful and hard-to-observe parts of the real war (including the slaughter of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, their exaggerated view of the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially the "Golden Palace Poker" ads on the US tanks. In some places it gets a bit too much, but in the end it still shows exactly what a young Mel Brooks style is. Overall, the movie is very well done for its budget and it is definitely worth a look. It is not considered one of the great satires of cinema, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
