Great little thriller. I had expected some kind of stupid horror movie, but I got a tight thriller that does not waste any of our time. Most of these films have to go into the stories of the hindsight, so that we either feel compassion for them or feel hatred when people are killed. Such stupidity here. Yes, you see some characters, but they really only interact with the principals. Like the husband in the motel whose room was canceled. We saw her so we could see how efficient the Lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel employee was. We see the little girl simply because later in the film, it will play a very small but important role when it all starts. The flying artists, because above all we have to drive the action forward. Above all, the evil needs them at the beginning of the flight. The rude guy in the airport was also important to the movie. The only two characters, who were only five liners of no use to the plot, were the two young men on the plane. It was smart because I thought they had something to do with Plot. From the first to the last scene, the female character, a young hotel manager named Lisa, is responsible. Even if Jackson shows his true colors, she does not panic. She thinks what she can do to stop time. Every other movie the smart leading women behave like idiots. But not these. It was a very short film, and I waited for the usual plotter equipment to be used as the movie seemed to finish quickly. Thankfully, none of them was used. The new hotel clerk did not type as usual and told her what to do. It was panic, run the phone from the hotel without saying anything, or ask the boss and tell her that she had a lot to drink and just dismiss her. War Craven should do more of these films. Also one last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he is Lisa's dad. He is completely unrecognizable.
