What a masterpiece. To take the conflict of the Cold War and transport it into the future. This movie is a satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The clever designation of the two superpowers as a bund and market. Cons as Commies and Market, The West! outstanding. The clever use of Gen-Joxs was ahead of its time. Only we really see the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot Joxs dealt with the subject in 1989. <br /> <br /> This film is about the companionship of the humble and how he can overcome the wishes of the government. These movies do not scream, DO YOU FOLLOW THAT YOU KILL ALL OF US. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
