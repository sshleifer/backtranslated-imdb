My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This great series was one of the first to be color-coded, and it had a big impact on convincing Americans that they needed to buy a color television that was about $ 800 in 1959, today more than $ 3,000. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was 11 when the show started, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If I see her now, 50 years later, I can think of a few things. First, many of the storylines refer to the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining from 1859. For 1859, weapons and clothing are largely unauthentic. (The haircuts are not included in the discussion.) That's basically a nitpick. <br /> <br /> And it would have been impossible for Ben to arrive in Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and a 100 square mile ranch for the next twenty years. Even before 1847, pioneers tried to solve the Sierra Nevada problem, and the gold rush began only two years later. Indians are not played by American actors. John Ford used Native American actors in the 1920s. The bonanza producers could have easily done so 30 years later. That's a big nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other time problems. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears and he is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also vary between 1859 and 1860 (before the Civil War) and what was more appropriate for a time frame of 1880. There are always problems with continuity. <br /> <br /> It's also a bit strange that there's so much murder in the first season. Over time, killing was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes take on a socially liberal bias, which, given the timetable, would be hard to believe, but the authors benefit from the recognition of seismic shifts The nation's stance began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the acting is good, and in recent years I have come to the conclusion that Adam's character was better drawn than that of others. I do not think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved. Season 1 also highlights the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. Many of the stories can be traced back to historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was a great family entertainment, and the show is doing well in every way.
