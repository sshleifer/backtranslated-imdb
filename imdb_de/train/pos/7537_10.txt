Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club offers real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments, and a different perspective than ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS consider best. Unlike other programs that provide social and religious commentary, those behind the 700 Club are helping people in need who feed hunger with Operation Blessing, helping doctors in those deprived communities, and giving hope to those who hope need. It's not hateful at all. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest searching for the remote and setting the channel of your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN headline news or programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way in which the ABC family inserts the disclaimer, that the views of the 700 club are not those of the ABC family.
