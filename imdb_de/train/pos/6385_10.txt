This movie was great! It was an excellent reproduction of an ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without vocals. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was another working level for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little edgy, but the beauty and opulence of the landscape more than made up for it. The music was largely instrumental, but that was perfect for the movie. This was definitely not a movie that needed the characters to immerse themselves in the song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
