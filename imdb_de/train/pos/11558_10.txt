"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far surpasses its reputation. People all know, they hum the title song, they complain of living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a demanding "Felix" ... but they do not sell the movie without knowing it. This is not just about a nice guy who lives with a sloppy guy. It is a portrait of two friends helping each other through the ordeal of divorce. It's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's a kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful, and just horrible situations. Some viewers actually found the movie uncomfortable, but I think its accuracy is its strength. In addition, the bulldog face of Matthau attracts me! My favorite comedy from a country mile.
