If there was a masterful adaptation than this, you do not need to look for it; In this near-perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece you will find everything and much more. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a movie that urged me to read the novel on which it is based, but I'll give it to Here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have missed very little in dialogue and action or in intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the immense curiosity and emotion this masterpiece has awakened in me. <br /> <br /> I do not have to divulge anything in the plot here. Let me just say this: If you are not sure whether you should see or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, I beg you not to doubt it! Any atom of power and magic that has made Jane Eyre a popular classic in English literature has been successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë did not bring herself, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate into the limelight with amazing intensity.
