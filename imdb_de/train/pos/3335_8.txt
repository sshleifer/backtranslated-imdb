The movie shocked me. Personally, I had herd mostly bad humming. Well, after having the DVD for months now, I've packed it into a sleepless night. Although the film drew the extra footage, the extra footage was used deliberately, the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from supplementing the game would have been less realistic if they had not left out any scenes. The best thing about the movie is the correspondence with the relationship. There were no ex's or characters who threatened the relationship. Usually, we see the girl meet with an amazing turn of fate, they meet, something we saw comes, breaks them apart, and they come together again in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow this form. We actually experienced the relationship and it's shortcomings. Although the characters had moments of anti-love, they did not have any dramatic pauses in which they were all fifteen years old and did a montage and then found themselves in love again. I did not feel that the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance. The story was unique and truthful in the way that I thought these people in the film were the most credible I've seen in a modern-day romance movie on. It's not "my beautiful wife", but it's a spirited and honest movie. I just say, I like it.
