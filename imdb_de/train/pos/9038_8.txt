I loved October Sky. I loved the music the most. It worked in two ways: In the first hour of the movie, the viewer has a timeframe. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits perfectly with the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I not only enjoyed the music, but also the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was particularly surprising to me. He did a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). and both times I had a great time.
