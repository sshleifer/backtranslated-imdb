Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can not remember a Pixar animation except for the two Toy Story movies that I laugh so much. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. The snippets make up this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant that gets into trouble. Hopper is an excellent characterization of the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as well as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also excellent support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on like this. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but we have solid entertainment. 10.9. Bethany Cox
