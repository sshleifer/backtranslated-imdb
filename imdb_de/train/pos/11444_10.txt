Watch this movie for the beautiful pictures of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and treat yourself to a completely new and relaxing experience. The music complements the footage perfectly, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak point. Keep in mind, however, why should you explain this in a movie if you can read Andy's reflections in detail in his books or attend one of his excellent talks? This medium is much better suited to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is used expertly in this respect.
