I went to The Straight Story with a sad / happy drama with good direction and good acting. I got these. What I did not expect was an allegory of the processes of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to make a simple story about a 300-mile ride on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human situation. <br /> <br /> If you did not notice it, watch it again and watch out for the age of the people Alvin gets to know, the terrain he drives through, the reactions that people give, the kind the discussions he leads (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside a graveyard). The last road he drives down is particularly insistent in this regard as he narrows and increases his anxiety and nervousness. The last mechanical failure could be regarded as death and the miraculous rebirth of his motor in relation to a life after death in which he achieved the desired reunion. I just hope that some of the people who call this branding a slow, sappy melodrama will take the time to look at it holistically.
