The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable. The band brings their modest college musical to the bright (but fickle) lights of Broadway filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) beats his point. So the others go their separate ways so that he does not feel responsible for them. Kermit herself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer who makes ends meet by serving food in her dad's diner (the old man has a line of particularly desperate non-sequencers!). We get the usual cameo appearances from various stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as Trickster), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE, 1979]), Gregory Hines , Liza Minnelli (when she herself had replaced her portrait in a posh restaurant with Kermit's sporty fake mustache, as a supposedly celebrated entrepreneur who introduced the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in perhaps the funniest scene the film as a Broadway producer, in front of the Kermit Streetwise and coquettish and wearing funny shadows and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical steps, but this time (unfortunately) less space is given to Gonzo; while Miss Piggy is something of a learned taste in my life, the scenes in which the latter spies, what she thinks of Kermit's romance with the waitress? and especially their violent reaction to it? are certainly funny. What is disappointing, however, is the climax show itself (after a rather redundant midsection, in which Kermit gets amnesia and eventually commercials on Madison Avenue), which instead of the expected tangy routines brings nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!
