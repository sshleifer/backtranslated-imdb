The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest in French is translated by French. Sometimes the characters changed in the middle of a scene between the two! When I tried to give the movie ONLY subtitles or just to sync, it made no difference! Strange, but still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story claims to be based on a Poe story, though I can not remember which one. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and at the end of the film - although he did not look much like him, he can not stay home all night. It seems to win a light bet - even if the house is very scary. However, it can not be that easy, as the rich guy says that all those who have previously bet have died - but this idiot STILL wants to do the job! At home he meets the beautiful Barbara Steele and falls in love with her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! How can that be?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil the tension. Convince yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film gets very good grades for a spooky atmosphere. The house, the black and white camera and the music make for a scary movie. As for the plot, it's interesting - especially because there are many twists and turns - so many that you're wondering who at the end of the movie is currently among the undead. > The only negative is that I regretted the poor serpent, who was unnecessarily killed. As crazy as it sounds, I was sorry, and it hardly seemed necessary to me. <br /> <br /> Also, parents may want to know that there's some nudity towards the end. A strikingly beautiful woman appears at the top without, but is hardly necessary for the plot.
