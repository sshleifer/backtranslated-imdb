An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders through the forest to witness a murder, but has he seen the murder or is he losing his mind? Is he just getting old? The movie is so great because the viewer has to get an idea of ​​what's going on. There is very little dialogue in this film, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. They knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The other part I liked was the photos of the forest in late autumn and winter. That was pretty, but the only thing I did not like was the look of the old man in his underwear. He could have tied the robe a bit tighter, but otherwise it was a pretty deep movie.
