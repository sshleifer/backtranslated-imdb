The first thing I thought after seeing "Mystery Men" was how this movie might be so unpopular. I found this movie so adorable and funny that it has the status of a bomb and contradicts logic. Well, I hope it will become a cult hit in the future, and you can count me among its fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving too much away, this comic-book movie is what "the Princess Bride" did for fairy tales and "who framed Roger Rabbit?" did for classic cartoons. This should give you a better idea of ​​the sound of the film than the marketing committee that unfortunately signed it (this is a case like "The Iron Giant," in which the studio had no idea what it was in his hands would have). Rent it the next time you feel like something unusual. You'll never hear the BeeGees in the same light again.
