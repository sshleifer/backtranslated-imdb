Jon Voight is brilliant at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, while reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that makes me see films. As a depiction of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in New York's gangs comes to mind, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman Ratso lends. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's play that the actor we most often identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the four or five best actors in the history of the film when he plays around the people around him so that he increases his achievements well beyond the normal level. <br /> <br /> Voights Buck is so naive that he would slip out of the movie except Ratso pulls him down. He pulls him down, but also teaches him a lot about survival and how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that no matter how a movie is, it has a very beautiful message no matter how much loser you are (Ratso clearly defines "loser") if you can find a way to be true to yourself. You are in possession of the mystery of life, and you can even share that insight with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help but compare Midnight Cowboy with Klute, a couple of years later, which in my opinion is more of a movie where you find yourself and turn into a movie about escape.
