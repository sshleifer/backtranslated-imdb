This short film, which inspired the soon-to-be-released feature - Spatula Madness - is a fun piece that fights against similar cartoons that several authors champion. The short film stars Edward the Spatula, who after being fired from his job joins the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows some fun content at the beginning, but is barely available for the rest of the feature. The 15-minute season of this film is recorded by a comic comedy and a small music number. Unfortunately, not much else is included. The planned plot does not really have time to show. However, it is certain that it is better than many high-budget Hollywood movies. This movie is worth it at least a couple of times. Take it for what it is and do not expect a deep story.
