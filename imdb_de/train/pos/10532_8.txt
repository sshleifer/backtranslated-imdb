Let the world disappear. Take it from my shoulder. Say the things you said earlier and make the world disappear. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a cucumber, one for embezzlement and the other for a kiss. None of them was guilty, but they did not land in front of charges and their house, which was about to demolish. The whole world, except her house, went away. <br /> <br /> It's kind of funny, but funny too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends simply enjoy each other's company and do whatever they want. But it's getting old quickly, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they start to improve their lives by hating memories. The sound effects were great. <br /> <br /> In the end it was really funny. This film was the product of a great imagination and was written and directed by Vincenzo Natali with the help of the two stars. It just has to be seen.
