Hmmmm, do you want a little romance with your secret? That's it. I think if the romance were given up, it would have made a better movie. But how could romance be given up if the story is from a Harlequin romance novel, whatever that is. Had the romance been abandoned, the story might have been a bit too weak. The puzzle here was not so bad, pretty interesting, but nothing at the level of international espionage of Mission Impossible. Well. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; I think her short skirts added sex appeal ... but this Rob Stewart guy probably could have been better cast, maybe with a more well-known TV actor. The direction was decent and the writing could have been improved - both could have been a bit edgier, a bit darker, more adventurous. The great thing was the use of genuine European locations. That could have changed a bit, being shot in Canada, but they were really in beautiful places like Budapest.

If this were a more dramatic movie shot for the big screen, perfect scenes for the postcard would really have to sit back and be just a nice part of the background. This, however, was just a TV movie, so they had to add some ummmph to the picture, and part of it came from the scenery. Overall, it was not really a bad movie. I'll tell you something, that was absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've ever seen! (and the only thing I know.)
