The autobiography on which this film is based is still one of the most exciting books I have ever read. It tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both of whom, in their seventies, earned reverence and respect as a teacher and dentist, and then lived with dignity for another thirty years. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as a rebellious "black" Bessie, the dentist. It not only expresses her anger, her fear and her wisdom; It lets you know exactly where they come from, using a word economy. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling that the older sister, the teacher, has completely died, but I'm afraid she never lets me believe she's over 100. No matter - the stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and pushy when she's overwhelmed and unsure in the first half of the movie as a Caucasian NY Times reporter. Again, this is just a little distraction. The stories are anything but attractive and though two or three are easily damaged in translation, most of them fare well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book to all the readers that I recommend as essential reading any books too. I can not watch this TV movie in this rare air, but it certainly captures enough of the flair to be very rewarding on its own.
