This was another great Tom Berenger movie. But some people are right, it was like another SGT BARNES character, but it was still great. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zane was a bit crazy at first, as was Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but in the end he was a bit more aggressive! Sniper was great and action freaks should see it. Let me remind you that there would not be as much action as an action-action strip. I also got this on DVD and it is excellent!
