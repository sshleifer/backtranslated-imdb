This is the best picture of baseball since Redford hit The Natural in our own way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Decorated with dreams - dripping in reality - the American Dream returns after 9.11, with a true story about Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian-born actress Rachel Griffiths plays a native West Texan better than many other Texans I know. and Dennis Quaid was perfection? Casting as a wannabe, Gonnabe and modest winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It is real. The chemistry on the screen works. If you like baseball heart warmers, you will love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in it. My popcorn became "a la mode". <br /> <br /> And hey: buy CD! The music rocks and carries the story splendidly! By syncing words and music, the story moves as it should, an area that most often disappoints me. <br /> <br /> Criticisms: I would have passed the baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach about character and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a beautiful decoration, but they never found their place in history to open and close. A little long worth every minute in the last analysis. 8/10. <br /> <br />
