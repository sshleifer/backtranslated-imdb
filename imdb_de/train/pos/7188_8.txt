This was repeated by BBC TV in the early 1980s, along with King of the Rocket Men. If I were charging a time capsule from that time, both series would definitely go in. <br /> <br /> Someone who sees it for the first time will think that it is stupid, but this is one of the best examples of the "series". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was a little nickname for him, it was Mr. Dustbin's head) and it was funny when he was shot. He says, "Your bullets can not hurt me," then he stumbles back, seemingly less happy. I also like the way he does without Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I looked at it again, because I had good memories of it, a few years ago, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect water, rockfalls, out-of-control carts. .. Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) the sword fighting game was not nearly as good as I remembered, and yes, it contains the inevitable "Flashback" episode! It gets 8 out of 10 points because it still suffers from slower speed, upholstery and the other tricks. If you are interested in this series, I recommend William Witney's book, "In a Door, Into a Fight, Out of a Door, Into a Chase," even though there is only a small entry about this series in it.
