For the longest time I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. Well, last summer I saw both of them together and decided that I was wrong. The first is a better Care Bears movie (as you might guess if you read my review). This is not a bad movie, it's just ... VERY SELF. <br /> <br /> As some people have already mentioned, this denies any knowledge of the first movie. I can not imagine another sequel so obviously contradicting the original (especially the sexes of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and watching, I was pretty confused and disturbed. I had the same feeling of seeing it as an adult! <br /> <br /> Continue to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good (IF you separate it from the first movie). I can not imagine another movie for little kids that has a DEMON because it's just a village. Now I do not want to suggest for a minute that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and Care Bears are good. I just think it's cool that in a movie there is SUPREM bad for kids! It's like this bizarre "Santa Clause vs. Satan" movie from Mexico that you hear about sometimes. Anyway, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Bears in return for his special powers. Very dark for a children's movie? And did I mention that Darkheart most often appears to the girl as a WOMAN 10 YEARS OLD? Freaky! Meanwhile, some other kids are in Care-a-Lot and take care of BABY CARE BEARS! Oh man! Demons and Baby Care Bears IN THE SAME FILM !!!!! Needless to say, in the end, everything will be sorted out (but not before Darkheart can catch the souls of the Care Bears in this trap, scary chandelier thing in a [surprisingly] deeply troubling scene). However, I have the question of whether this film has found the cult audience that it has earned so richly. I could look at it myself again.
