How sweet my little Frenchman was, tells a story that is alternately sad, frightening and life-affirming. It ends with a brutal finale that you knew would happen, even if you had hoped - maybe even believe - it would not. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is the film's biggest asset: it plays skillfully With your emotions and expectations, you drop a bomb. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a movie theory class at USC in the mid '90s. It is not easy to find, but definitely worth a search.
