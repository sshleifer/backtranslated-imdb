A comedy gem. Many laugh out loud, the shop and pub scenes have made me laugh uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue good to watch - I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly gentle and the movie (which may sound weird) reminds me of an Ealing comedy. It's a quirky little movie with lots of details. It certainly requires a number of visits. I've looked at it a couple of times (I've shown all my friends!) And see something new every time - a bit of dialogue, something visual that I had not found before. I could get pretty picky and find some flaws in the movie, but I do not go because it's all about a very entertaining, good movie that's really worth a watch and that anyone with a sense of humor has to enjoy. It's a movie that will make friends, and I hope there are many of them. Oh .... and it has a great soundtrack.
