Although this is not necessarily a so-called "classic" movie by today's standards, it is nevertheless worth seeing. The main reason for this is that after experiencing this movie you feel that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 1960s, no matter how good or bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this random movie in an English literary class on SUNY Geneseo, and although it seems to be just a pointless composition of icons from the 1960s, the film is by no means simply "thrown together". <br /> <br /> My point is that if you feel dissatisfied and confused, the film has done its job: It gives a desolate look into the future that makes you insecure and angry. It was perhaps the same feeling that the film sought to explore in youth, which he exemplified. As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not be able to tell a very good (or interesting) story and at the same time His characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, it does so well convey that kind of clich√©d, rebellious desire to come out of existence that both Mark and Daria have to share. Even anti-establishment students are as spotty as the government they rebelled against.
