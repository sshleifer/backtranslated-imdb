I have a six-month-old baby at home, and she keeps battling sleep. One morning, she had a particularly difficult time falling asleep when the Doodle Bops theme song hit TV. I put her on her hutch and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and actually laugh at the show. She kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also got a video of them, so sometimes, when my little one is nervous, I have something to calm down. Granted, late at night, when she wakes up with colic and the doodle bops are not nervous, they are not her cup of tea. The biggest surprise with the Doodle Bops is that my kid does not like TV. She would rather play with a toy or with our little toy poodle on the floor than watch TV. I do not know if she will like her in the future, but right now she's stuck.
