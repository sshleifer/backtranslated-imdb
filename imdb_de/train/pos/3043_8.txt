In this movie, you'll learn why Amitabh Bacchan is a one-man industry. In this movie, you'll also learn why Indian moviegoers are smart buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of his reign over Bollywood when his former godfather, Prakash Mehra, opted for a picture again. Prakash has a habit of picking topics and building stories by adding liberal cans to Bollywood sensibility and stereotypes. Zanzeer saw the Angry Young Man. Lawaris was a bastard and Namak Halal was a master of loyalty. <br /> <br /> But then the topic was limited to moving the script through the regulation of three hours of song, dance and drama. What's in the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi going to Mumbai and turning into a regulatory hero. Amitabh's vocals and Diction have shown that this film has earned a lot of money thanks to its flawless Haryanvi accent. For me, that alone is the biggest move in the movie. The rest is typical Bollywood screen writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of it. The shoe capriole in the party, the monologue about Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene, which has now become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added extra mile to the movie with its moody, picky character (remember how he asked Ranjeet about the poisoned cake event after "Shaaadaaaap"). His main task was Master, while Amitabh was his faithful servant mind ... and so Shashi had to carry his acting with the rest of the movie. It was a character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a capsule, remember, and as long as it stayed That way the people came and saw Amitabh, who was wearing a new hat, and went home happily. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the girl and the bad go to jail, the age old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all well, that ends well. <br /> <br /> So what makes this movie a classic? Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created another symbol in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the storyline. My grades are for Amitabh only.
