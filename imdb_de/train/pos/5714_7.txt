I was so excited to see this movie because I had always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing is that it's a Japanese movie they wanted to bring to America, but they actually filmed it Japan with the original crew! I think that made the movie ... more Japanese (which was probably the reason it was quite successful, unlike most horror movie flops from Japan to America), but also made it slightly inaccessible to American audiences. The difference that scared the Japanese culture and what American culture felt throughout the movie. It worked well when they wanted to capture the main character's nervous fear: a frightened fish in a big, bustling, unknown Tokyo pond. <br /> <br /> The plot was also pretty confusing. In a typically Japanese way, it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we are constantly moving forward and backwards until we see the end and the beginning of the whole story at the end of the film. This constant paging of time was very confusing for me. I also did not think that some things were explained so well, and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel, which seems to reveal more of the story). <br /> <br /> Overall, there's a lot to love for the American audience, lots of freaky images and macabre details that are a healthy jumping jump.
