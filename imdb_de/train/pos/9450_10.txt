Like Peckinpah with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman provided an effective film about Man's violent side in DELIVERANCE, a definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businesspeople who decide to go canoeing on the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before being dammed into "a big, dead lake". <br /> But The native mountain dwellers take a painfully obvious, grim look at these "city boys" who are streaming through their forests. And the following day, Beatty and Voight are charged and sexually assaulted by two malicious miners (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward) (the infamous "SQUEAL!" Sequence of the movie). What started out as a lark in the Appalachian Mountains has become a nightmare in which our four protagonists see the thin line between what we call civilization and what we consider barbarism. <br /> James Dickey has adapted the script from his own bestselling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for his "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also a throbbing tempest, with the four leading men in their roles and McKinney and Coward for two of the most frightening villains of all time. A must-see movie for those who want to take a risk.
