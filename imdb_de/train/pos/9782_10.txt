Peaches is really a wonderful movie. I'm writing this to refute a review by someone named 'Auscrit' who appeared on this page. First of all, the idea that either Monahan's first film "The Interview" is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement. Here's a movie that has been praised all over the world and is simply one of the best Australian movies ever made. It was absolutely worth it to get the best picture. Peaches is a courageous, courageous and courageous departure. For me it works on every level and I have seen it twice now. Monahan is a filmmaker who demonstrates great skill and incredible sensitivity. For "Auscrit" to make the comment that this is another TV movie etc. and that Hugo Weaving is not good, "just" does not get the movie. Or it does not want to get it in particular. Honestly, it's the kind of comment you'd expect from another filmmaker who's jealous or bitter, or both. Or someone from the industry, either sales, exhibition or bureaucracy. I found her average punter, just do not write such comments. I have noticed other comments on the site and references to the movie Sommersault. You have to ask yourself what people believe, look at them. Unfortunately, in Australia, at the time SS was released, the push was, if you did not like it, then something was wrong with you, not with the movie. This manipulation of the media is generally quite common. Reality is the only similarity between the two films that they are rights to passages. Unfortunately for me SS is a movie about nothing that could have been said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional movie about fear. Peaches are a masterpiece. Personally, I can not wait to see what Monahan will do next, as he is clearly ahead of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. Conclusion: If the film does not win at this year's AFI's and IF Awards, then it's a rigged game. At Auscrit you will find something constructive with your time
