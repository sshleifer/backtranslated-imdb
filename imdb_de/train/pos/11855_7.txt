Impressive. Somewhat surprising. Although it is faulty, it is far better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The brand new Arcturus spacecraft, with some 3,000 passengers, is in the last days of its sixteen-day journey to Jupiter. Without warning, the cerebral (central computer) of the ship issues a disaster alert and orders all to evacuate the ship. <br /> <br /> Soon there will be only a handful of people, including an astrogator of the ship (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the shipping company (Kenyon). <br /> <It turns out that the alarm was wrong and that the main cerebral is acting unpredictably. The remaining passengers and crew must flee the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off very well. The opening ad is a very nice gesture. There are obvious parallels to 2001: a space odyssey and the historic sinking of the Titanic. The movie sometimes slows down and has some speed issues, but is generally well done and well played.
