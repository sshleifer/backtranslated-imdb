I'm not sure if I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-rage people are talking about, maybe it's just that some people may have been chattering about things, maybe having trouble with the time changes, actors were too willing to visit places, which I would rather not go, etc.), but in my opinion there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I loved that bit of 'rule breaking'. Usually, when you leave the haunted house, the bad guys leave you alone and give you time to reformulate, make friends, and find the mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (Half-Spoiler Alarm) If you hide under the ceiling, you can only get through the small opening through which you look. Normally, the ghosts have somehow become more sinister because they have found out that they have simply been misunderstood, or that they have been freed or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production was exceptional. While the film was barely loaded with special effects, the supernatural parts were extremely short while short, extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie for those who consider Freddy and Jason to be the ultimate horror (nothing (they have their place against them), but great for those who took the convention for granted and none Have time distortions.
