Dana Andrews is one of those actors I've probably seen in a dozen films, but never really signed up for me. He is often incomprehensible, taciturn, plays the same roles and looks similar to the similarly undervalued Glenn Ford. He is an actor who really needs to make an effort to really appreciate him; but once you hit the right movie ... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's melancholy view of New York's abdomen is as dirty and dingy as any fifties noir, and Andrews is in his element as the overly tough policeman Mark Dixon, who just does not know how to play the game to move forward : He hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally kills the witness of a murder in which an illegal crap game was made by a gangster whom Dixon hates for personal reasons. He spends the rest of the film covering up his involvement and bringing the gangster his kind of "justice." On the way he is committed to the alienated wife of the killed man (Gene Tierney) and must also try to get her father off the hook for the murder. <br /> <br /> Breathtakingly photographed by Joseph LaShelle with hard and sparkling dialogues by Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy found in a minute or two of grace. This is another noir for eternity and could be my favorite movie so far - it's just as good as the more proclaimed Laura.
