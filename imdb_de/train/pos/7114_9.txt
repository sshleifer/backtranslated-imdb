In any case, among the top five of the best John Garfield films must be Pride of the Marines. It is the true story of the maritime privateer Al Schmid, who at the cost of his own sight wounded a horde of stormy Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is divided into three parts, Al Schmid lives at home, where he is just stiff and feels serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he went to war because there were millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see part of the action in an isolated machine gun nest and holding Japanese troops. His action prevented naval positions from being overrun, but a grenade does it in his eyesight. <br /> <br /> And the third part, of course, is its painful adaptation to civilian life and to reassure oneself that people are not just taking care of it. He was out of compassion, especially this girl he is Eleanor Parker saw. <br /> <br /> This movie was aired on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield being hosted by his daughter. One respondent said that Garfield is the most credible actor in the role of the working class if he has and possesses a union card. In this regard, he was lucky that he had landed in Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Despite being a gangster in the tradition of the studio, Garfield's background made him great because he came from the life of Al Schmid, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was perfect to play the role of a work hero like Al Schmid, who took responsibility for defending his country. No great exploits here, just a guy who would rather have been back in Philadelphia but done a job that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a great role for Garfield. It's a movie you should not miss. But I wonder what happened to the real Al Schmid.
