I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew for reviving Visayan's once moribund film. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a revival of this vernacular (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and life style details are reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: the stupid and stilted spectacle of the American antagonist. The other point I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity of the "historical" costume of the same character, and especially his bright red car, which I thought was a roadster of the 1930s. Without these small but blatant details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least 9 out of 10 in my rating - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film certainly wins Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which offered a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War. There are also some places where the cinematography goes back to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the plot begins to remember "Noli Me Tangere".
