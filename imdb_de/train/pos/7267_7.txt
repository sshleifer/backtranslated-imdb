Curly Sue is 6 years old, rich in hair and a life as a drifter. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive in the street by being small time contenders. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive parking garage while Curly is going to shout about legal proceedings and traction to the intended victim. It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately shocked at what she did. The scammers not only earn some money, they can also sleep in Gray's elegant apartment. Even then, Gray thinks she owes them more, so the three hang together for a spell. Gray only knows the lucrative legal business and nothing about life. Who could teach them better than Bill and Curly, these savvy experts on the realities of life? But all good things must come to an end, and there is no life for a lawyer and a few cheaters. Or is there This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but of course much edgier. Belushi offers a rare touching performance as his feelings of happiness are down, and Lynch is as bright as the snooty, yet gently touching lawyer. John Hughes, as author and director, once again shows his magical touch as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just watch as Curly and Bill Gray get out for a night of no money and see the humorous results. Do you long for a happy ending, long promised and finally delivered with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your tailor made movie.
