Sabrina, the teenage witch, was one of my favorite TV series of life: I saw episodes every day in a row when I came home from school. So far, I think I saw each episode at least once and the whole series three or four times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenager / witch with normal teenage problems we can all tackle. She is funny, smart, sociable, funny and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit very well with Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist and Hilda, the crazy, crazy, form a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. I have to agree that the college years are not as good as their high school years, but that does not mean that they were not always good. I think the end was fantastic, although it was not what I had hoped, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
