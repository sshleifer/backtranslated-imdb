This movie is the best movie to see cartoon feeling. The sets, costumes, and colors are as alive as if you were entering a comic book. This is the movie I'm thinking about when the mob is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the settings. Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can not help but regret Madonna as she tries and fails to win Tracy for herself. This film contains all the classic mob stereotypes - burying people in concrete, blowing cars up, tying the good guys and trying to blow up his girlfriends' house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in the literal sense of the word, even screaming camera angel comic book. It's so great to be able to return to an older movie and see that someone knew how to turn a comic into a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and the Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!!
