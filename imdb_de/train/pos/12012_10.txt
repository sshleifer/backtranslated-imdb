I saw it this morning at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial building in Salt Lake City. I assume that the level of enjoyment during this film will largely depend on the acceptance of Joseph's story. However, apart from that it was very well done, well handled and had a nice score. If you come to Salt Lake City, it's a must to see it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been to a nicer theater in terms of image quality, sound quality and ambience in my entire life ... I wonder if the church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Since I am LDS and Joseph is a prophet, I was touched in several places and brought to tears several times ... which was probably thought to have spread tissue BEFORE the movie started! Anyway, I was told that this movie is available in several LDS visitor centers around the world. If you have 70 minutes, look at this, because if you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
