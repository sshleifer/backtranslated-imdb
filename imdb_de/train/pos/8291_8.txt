"The Lady in Question (1999)" with Gene Wilder is a well-rehearsed mystery drama that reminds me of the old black and white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and "Cash" let me guess until the end. There were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but I had no idea which character it would be. Gene Wilder has a special charming joke about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections he is perfect for the part. The parts of the film in which actors were portrayed were very well done. I am sure that this is an additional challenge for the cast. I'm not surprised to see that he wrote a lot for the film. Even his singing was a pleasure. I like him more in this role than his earlier "gritty" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope A & E will continue this series. You should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wild Mysteries". <br /> <br /> The music was right at this time. I enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes. At first I was a bit unclear whether we see a flashback or whether the action took place during this time. And I do not agree that incorporation of obscenities is necessary for the flow of the script. That always distracts me. <br /> <br /> All in all, my wife and I enjoyed this second in a well-done startup, which we hope will be many others - just like one of our favorites: Raymond Burrs Perry Mason.
