In the 1940s, when films talked about things that were not yet allowed in "polite" society, they resorted to codes that allegedly floated over the heads of most viewers, while alerting those who know about what happened , No movie of the decade was likely to be alluded to like the strangely obscure Desert Fury set in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla, somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage Saloon and Casino is the amazing Mary Astor, who is outfitted in pants and with a cigarette holder; The city is home to her handful of daughter Lizabeth Scott, who is looking for $ 20 million in Technicolor. However, listen to the dialogue that points to an older lesbian and her young, restless companion (one can only wonder if A. Bezzerides's original script made this relationship explicit). Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as an incredibly jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as city sheriff, stir and sit back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall for Scott. However, it seems that not only did Hodiak have a past with Astor, but he also had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun heats these ingredients to a hard boil, with a lot of slaps and a filled exchange. Do not miss this greenhouse melodrama, replete with creepy exotic flowers if you like it. It is a remarkable movie.
