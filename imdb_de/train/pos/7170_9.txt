HOLES is not a normal Disney stuff - it's very, very funny, even for adults, who are usually part of the cute, focus group-designed "Family Entertainment" that Uncle Walt's Studio presents as a live action. Perhaps the secret of this film's success lies in its fidelity to the original book, which is a bit darker than the average child's toy. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a prison camp for boys, where all inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun to prove reunification. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure is ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an All-Boy detention center. Jon Voight is particularly evil and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful as always.
