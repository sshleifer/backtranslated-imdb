If a movie is magical, I do not need it to be fluent or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in other places, etc. etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not affect the overall positive impact of helping people in areas of life that are most incomprehensible and difficult to remedy. Both characters are smart. But Stanley can not understand enough to work because he can not read. He can not read because he had too much adventure in his childhood. Although Iris has had a good education, she has not had enough adventures and therefore can not understand how she is passing the turn that has cost her life. In their mistakes and strengths complement the characters. It may be a bit difficult to accept that an iris would work in a factory year after year, or that Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or in another, better paid job. And while these "mysteries" are explained throughout history, their unfolding seems a bit thoughtful. I assume that nobody took the time to rethink the script. Still, it's a good movie. Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!
