Hidden Frontier is a fan show in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returns from the Delta Quadrant. It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original for the show. The show takes place on the star base Deep Space 12 and on several spaceships, which offers the official shows no possibilities. The characters have the possibility of a rise in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship do not have. The show has a good computer animation of spaceships, but acting takes place before the green screen and gives the actors a green glow. Not all actors are equally good, but most are fine. The episodes are character-driven and the characters evolve over many episodes. It's a bit more like Babylon 5 than most official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes on taboos that even the official series did not use. All in all, I liked to see it.
