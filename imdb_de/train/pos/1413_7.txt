In 2006, AMPAS honored one of the most innovative documentary films showing wildlife at the coldest spot on earth. The film was March of the Penguins, which was narrated by Oscar winner Morgan Freeman. Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated racetrack for decades. They got stuck in live action movies and it's a hit all over the world. Disney then developed a subdivision called Disneynature and released his first feature film entitled Earth. This is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentary films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story of the great James Earl Jones offers nothing new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel in the last five years or is following the global warming crisis very closely. The earth touches the topic very deeply and takes the subject very liberal. <br /> <br /> It allows for an emotional connection to nature that I have not experienced before. It not only shows the beauty and mysterious parts of our beautiful planet, but also the grunting and disturbing aspects that often come with it. It is one thing to see "Mufasa" falling from a cliff into a rammer, or Bambi's mother being shot dead by a hunter in the middle of a forest. It's all good because at the end of the movie we know it's just a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all sorts of families from all walks of life who live and die in their natural habitats. These real things make a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although the graphic nature of the movie (which many people will not accept) is a bit heavy, the Earth is a touching experience. Here is an impressive film work by a great camera crew and an amazing score by George Fenton. While not a benchmark compared to the March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, it's good for you. At the end of the day, the appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness grows as many of us are unlikely to visit those places that we'll see in the movie. We live here, but it's as if we could never explore the planet for some reason. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
