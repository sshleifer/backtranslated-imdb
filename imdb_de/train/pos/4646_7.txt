I did not know what to make of this movie. I think that's what it was all about. I've never seen such a movie and I doubt I'll ever do that again. Glover puts together something that is unique to him. To appreciate this, one has to read some of his poems, maybe watch one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he's just so bizarre that I can not help it. Note: I have seen this movie before final editing. What I have seen and what others have seen is different. I'll know if I want to watch the movie again. I think I have to be really drug addicted ...
