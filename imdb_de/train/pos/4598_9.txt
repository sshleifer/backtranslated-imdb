This is one of Jackie's best films he has without the opera friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. He's got one of the best openings in any action movie, and so Jackie shows some high quality stunts that's the only point of criticism. In the middle, it gets a bit slow, but it's hectic for the last 25 minutes of the movie, and the credits show what a crazy fool Jackie Chan is just to make us movie lovers happy
