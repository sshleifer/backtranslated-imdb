When I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, I was in my middle teenage years and was a little reluctant to watch this movie as I considered myself adult and from the "Sesame Street / Muppets era". I honestly can not remember if I liked it or not. But somewhere in college, I saw that movie again, and it ended with my personal Best Films Ever collection. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of humor that would have gone far beyond what the Muppets expected. I mean, the Muppets have obviously always addressed adults and children because there is humor that is aimed at both generations. But come on ... Janice is overheard her telling someone "I take off for anyone, even if it is artistically" ... it is a joke of a father to a son when the son is in love with Kermit the frog, the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says, "I think we are now engaged," ... these and many other moments in Film got me rolling. Paste this very intelligent dialogue, the intelligent "wink" -Witz of New York / Broadway, the usual amount of celebrity Camsos and some really enjoyable songs which will not adjoin "cheesy" on children's level ... this film is a masterpiece! I do not throw out "10" regularly ... but it deserves it. Over 20 years later, this movie will be over, maybe even more. The Muppets were and will never be again, so funny and smart and just awesome as this movie was and is. --- Q
