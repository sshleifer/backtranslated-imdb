This is a strange film about an archaeologist who examines the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (really false-looking) mummy from a burial cave and brings her home to study. Well, pretty soon she starts acting funny and talking to this mummy. And shortly thereafter, her son is possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even strange events take place while the mind tries to destroy the woman's family. This is really REALLY boring, overall, and it will make you fall asleep the first time you try to look at it. But if you stick to it, you might make it to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the mystery of the mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to figure out what the motivation of the mind is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low budget (and the hairstyles of the 70s!), This will have a certain calming effect. The story is much clearer than the confused, boring one The way in which the film interprets the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow it does. Maybe this is a good movie in the heart, but executed in a rather embarrassing way. I dont know. What I know is that, despite his boredom, I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Spider Baby" will want to know that this movie uses some musical cues from this movie (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> A frightening and pretty well-done sequence in which obsolete boulders and rocks roll by themselves and eventually attack some people in a RV. Other scenes in the movie are just scary or quirky; But this one scene is really scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It's funny and worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.
