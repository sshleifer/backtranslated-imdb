THE BEAVER TRILOGY is without doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was fortunate enough to see it with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris at NY Video Festival a few years ago and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie MUST be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent's name on the internet and buying the movie from its website. He is an incredibly nice guy. Do not be confused: the cinematographer in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> After seeing the TRILOGY a few times, I have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version. It's like a try-out version for the Crispin Glover "Orkly Kid" section and is more interesting as a curiosity if you're a Penn fan rather than a good video. Penn is pretty funny, and you can see the virtues of a big star in this bubbling B & W video. <br /> <br /> This is probably also one of Crispin Glover's best roles, and I would like to see an updated documentary on the original Groovin 'Gary. If you watch this movie, you will never get Gary's nervous laughter out of your head again.
