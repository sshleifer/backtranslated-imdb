What is the probability that a "Mermaid" helium balloon will arrive from Yuba City, California (November 8, 1993) and land in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada (approximately 4000) 4 days later (November 12) Miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film not only helps children cope with losses, but also older people. I hope it will be fun !!! Rhonda
