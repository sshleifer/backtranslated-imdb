Although it is a tear jerker, it is definitely a feel-good movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith does the work as usual and does it well. I could go on, but pick ten out of the "10" ratings, and they said so, and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was very enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her in many future films. <br /> <br /> AND this movie shows that Will Smith has nothing to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
