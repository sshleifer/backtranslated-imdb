Sandra Bernhard's Without You I'm Nothing, the movie released in 1990, followed her off-Broadway production of 1988. What she and others in the movie call her "smash-hit one-woman show." "<br /> <br /> There have been several changes to monologues and one-lines, and the film version brings the story to the point and brings Sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage artist in New York your" superstar summer "to an illusory , almost desperate existence in her home in Los Angeles - her fictional manager in the film refers to bringing Sandra back to her roots, to ... upscale supper clubs like the Parisian Room "<br /> <br /> Here a point must be made. Sandra tries to direct her liberal worldview and her sometimes sharp criticism of American pop culture to an audience that does not fully see it. In L.A., she plays in front of a mostly black audience and tries to share her ideas when all these people seem to be "Shashonna," a stripper who looks like a Madonna. And even if Shashonna dances to drum beats similar to those of "Like a Virgin," there is not much to say to the viewer. The scene in the club is drier than a bone throughout the movie. A funny scene is a roundish man from the audience who helped Shashonna out of his pants. <br /> <br /> But when she goes down, Sandra does it with style and power, transferring everything from false self-esteem to punctuated vulnerability ... to the point where she's naked (literally ) asks for acceptance and yet somehow still floats in the pool of her own transparent fame. Her portrayals of interactions with people like Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (which we believe) Warren Beatty are fictional and funny. Sandra begins her show in her unpleasant moment as she plays a quiet but mysterious interpretation of Nina Simone's song "Four Women" in a mufti and other African robes, she sang lines like "My skin is black", "My hair is wooly "and" she "Call me Sweet Thing. "<br /> <br /> It revives the spirits of underworld art in a hilarious description of Andy Warhol's raging estate auction and celebrates it:" Leave it to Andy to put wisdom and sensibility into the world hours and hours of Work and work put into the Indian product ... that they were so lucky to pay off the whole Santa Fe thing that's just happening. "<br /> <br /> She talks about the overabundance of Hollywood and consoled a distraught friend, then admonished him and said," Lord, when it comes to Ishtar, I get up and go out of your life forever, because that is too rampant even for me! Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism Dressed up as a cosmos girl, Sandra tells her young wife the fantasy of becoming a secretary and marrying her boss, and concludes, relieved, "I'll never be a statistic, will not I. I'm under 35 and will marry! "Sandra praises the opening of sexuality in society:" If he touches you at night, does that feel good or does it feel real? I say it feels real ... MIGHTY real. "<br /> <br /> Finally she cries for progressive change American society by channeling the disco greats Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and" Eventually everyone will spark! "<br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of glittering, limp, but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and written by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams, and Laura Nyro, just to name a few At the same time, the idealized, imaginary incarnation of Sandra - her self-made reflection - floats through the city, a beautiful black model with flowing clothes and tight bustiers reading the kabala, studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music /> <br /> In "Without you, I'm nothing" Sandra Bernhard examines feelings and existences with which she had only played as a regular at Late Night With David Letterman to this day - her almost childlike enthusiasm f r the shock that was shown in the '80s, is cast aside in the face of a more subtle attraction, and their faith in materialism and the American celebrity is found to be refreshing. This approach to the comedy would forever change Sandra's direction and mark the more mature, more personal entertainer for coming things. <br /> <br /> If you like a subtle sense of humor that focuses on jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex and loneliness, despair and flat expression of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in jail. It can not be funny down the line. Maybe it's a bit disturbing or even maudlin for some. But keep in mind the emptiness of the world that Sandra paints for you, and you'll understand how witty and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But see you Without me I'm nothing to do with a friend "in the know" because it's definitely funnier. Before you know it, you will both trade with Sandra Barbs and confuse hell with everyone else.
