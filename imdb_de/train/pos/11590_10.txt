Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. At that time, I was more of a theatrical visitor. Now I like to learn movies and relax at home instead of going to the theater. I have also seen this short film "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I have been searching for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I finally got more information from your website. Thank you ........ I am surprised to learn that this short film was the opening of a Disney picture. I too could not remember the Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was an opening movie for Disney. I really wish they would eventually show this on TV. I wonder if Disey owns the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is a must for all generations !!!
