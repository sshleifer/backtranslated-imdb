I saw the movie on videotape a couple of days ago and although it was hard to swallow it all at once (because of its length and history), I liked the movie very much. I was impressed by the script first and then by the realization of this script. The movie takes you on a ride, but it's not an easy, happy ride; It goes through time and different political regimes and shows what influence they have on people's lives. What I loved was the inner logic that followed the movie. Logic, as well as logic in life, was sometimes illogical and confusing, but in the end, as I thought about it, all the events and phrases made sense. However, it makes no sense to try to recount the story in more than 50 years. I also really liked Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei and the way he played her, as some critics would see with restless devotion. What I did not like was that I think he later played characters reminiscent of Aleksei, in films like "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij Romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "The Offended and the Injured". ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, what a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made memorable movies like "Tango and Cash" and less like "Runaway Train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
