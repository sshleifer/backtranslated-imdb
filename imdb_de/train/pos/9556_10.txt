When our local TV station first launched, it filled out many old British programs. "Complete your daughters!" was duly broadcast, and I wavered as I opened the first few seconds of the movie - popping into a blank tape. The best I have ever done. <br /> <br /> The performers are wonderfully suited for their characters and bring them into a charming life with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will sting you, as does Hoyden and her family). , Double tophans abound, plot wheels within wheels mingle and match the characters, comic sight gags lurk in every scene, and daring comments are made on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> I showed the movie to some friends. Several years ago they called the play "a lost treasure" for both the cast and the story. To this day, I can think about the dialogue. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release, I'll be right up there.
