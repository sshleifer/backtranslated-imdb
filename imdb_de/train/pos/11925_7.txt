I saw this movie on cable one afternoon. I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan before, but sometimes I get into a good sports movie. What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community's mental health and care system, it was refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biologically Parents do not always take an active role, and transitions that can only be heartbreaking and heartwarming. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film and both bring credible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but at the end of the movie, I got a tear.
