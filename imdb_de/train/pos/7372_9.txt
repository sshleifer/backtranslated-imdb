"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the Chase genre, which many believe has a fundamental meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton falls in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see that. <br /> <br /> I really feel that this is presented with scenes like kickback and writing letters. Heaton shows a great closeness to Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he very carefully pays attention to spelling Spike's name on top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when watching external reviews is that when the movie is scheduled The reviewer does not seem to have fully understood the movie because they did not even mention the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some of the reviewers did not recognize it when using expressions like, "Who's Heaton, what does he do with a delay like Spike?" However, this person may have hit the nail on the head with her remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of A.D. D., although I do not believe that person recognized this because he seems to use the word "retard" as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the faint of heart. The film is exceptionally character-based, after the filming to the end there is not much, but the dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Stay away if you're not used to watching such deep, meaty movies.
