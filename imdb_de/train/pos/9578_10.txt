As others have mentioned, all the women who are naked in this movie are usually absolutely gorgeous. The plot shows very well the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around, they want to be persecuted, but when there are no "men" around, they become the persecutors of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy is fast becoming a man (at this age we should all be so happy!). Then he takes the courage to pursue his true love.
