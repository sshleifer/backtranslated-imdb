The turning point in "The Matador" begins about halfway through the movie as Danny, a straightforward Denver man, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City and enjoys a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door and knows it's Julian, the paid assassin. He refuses to answer. But does he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who shows no solvable qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action and are doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny in the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City, he spills the beans and tells his new friend what he really does for a living. Danny, who wants to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is going against a local outfit that seems to be ahead to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls victim to the charisma and charm that the wiser Julian triggers. Only later, on a cold winter night, does the killer appear at Danny's door and asks his friend to pay back a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. At this point, the mystery that connects them is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, who is acting against the guy, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just when you see him walking through the hotel lobby with his Speedo and boots, he gives the right impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this weird couple. Hope Davis only appears in a few scenes and makes us complain why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall makes an appearance as a link between Julian and his duties. Richard Shephard stylistically rules the work with his own material. The music is by Rolfe Kent and the sharp cinematography of David Tattersall underlines everything.
