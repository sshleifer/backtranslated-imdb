Originally, I hired this movie for my daughter because she is interested in football - and I was not disappointed that way (except for the action that intervened in the football scene). As a dad, I was probably a bit surprised when I introduced the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that these problems as parents for children are now completely available (as uncomfortable as I feel about the subject). In a way, this feeling was a leap into the movie's main premise - that eventually one has to trust the children to make their own decisions. This dilemma is introduced by a young, UK-born teenage girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of East Indian heritage, who dreams of playing professional football. The impending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage offers many opportunities to explore her hopes and fears for her future (in a nice way). <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations of her, as well as the content of most parents-parent relationships. <br /> <br /> In SUMMARY, the football scenes are GREAT (a lot to learn in Slowmo) and while I did not need the storyline - it took a bit of work to keep the movie going.
