The acting in this movie was outstanding. As an amateur rocketeer I have found very few mistakes. As a human, it touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you would think that they are the real characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, has left nothing out of her performance. The young actors who played the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired this eternal love / hate relationship between father and son, making it feel real. If you do not get a lump in your throat or shed a tear, when the first successful rocket goes off, or when father and son come to terms, have your pulse checked (you may be dead).
