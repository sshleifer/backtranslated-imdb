This is one of my favorites, along with the Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and the Agnes Moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes. <br /> <br /> It is an important recording from the middle of 1961 on the long Cold War in which the US was involved at the time. The run-down city scene, the sparse dialogue of the almost famished characters, their worn-out uniforms, and minimal action "says it all": the absurdity of an ongoing conflict that threatens to destroy human life and modern civilization, and all that sweet and is redeeming. <br /> <br /> It's a "fable" because it was made in a time when events had happened. Unlike the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962) it was actually a sensible representation of one of the major US cities that was ruined and filled with some miserable survivors. I also see it as a "fable" because it is not just a cautious story, but because it is the most liberating of all popular myths: it is a love story that is in an impossible situation involving two highly inappropriate lovers.
