It is great! In story mode you switch from punk to pro. You must achieve goals that include skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give him a name, and you can make him look stupid or realistic. You'll be with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets kicked by the skateboarding team (you can pick a team to play in) and then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of Story Mode) by Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and much more. You can create the destination pedestrians and write what they speak. If you get bored, you can reach the pre-built targets in prefabricated parks. The only thing I did not like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive the cars. 10.9.
