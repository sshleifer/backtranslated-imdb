Big S does not play with taboos or pushes for an agenda such as Mencia or Chapelle (though I both like). She gives the obvious in subtle, almost subliminal remarks. Your show will not change the world and is not meant to be. But along with the jolly Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show," this is a mean show with a craving for destruction! My page was completely destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famous friend Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with her. The best kind of comedy. Spoofing everything and everyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, as she sings to the fake birds to quickly comment on the society and age that constitute existential nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it in their recent Lippo suction or boob work).
