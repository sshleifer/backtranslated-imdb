Noni Hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance (which she has honored with an AFI award) equates at least three years later to her performance in FRAN. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's child, and Michael Caton (known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting is that Hazlehurst currently hosts the lifestyle program BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS, and Caton is the host of real estate programs, including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.) Australia's Best Female Actor in the Early '80s. Rating: 79/100.
