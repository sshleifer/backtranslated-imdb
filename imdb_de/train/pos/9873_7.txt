Lily Mars, a small-town girl living in Indiana, dreams of growing up on Broadway, and her aspirations are taken when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to visit his hometown. Lily tries everything so that Thornway notices her, but he is annoyed only by her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to stage his show, Lily (of course John unknown) follows and Thornway finally gives her a small role on his next show, just to please her family, but Thornway begins for this young woman fall girls and a romance blooms, which makes the show actress, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel is fed up with the John Lily romance that leads to friction on the show, she leaves and John decides to make Lily a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway has to tell Lily that she is returning to her small role in the play, which can also endanger romance. A very charming movie and a refreshing change, as Garland played the comic accent in her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, though she was meant to be funny, never threatened her career as a singer), I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he did that annoyed Lily, rather than being romantic. The movie became somewhat predictable and the scenes were not so well put together, but a very entertaining movie. Rating, 7.
