It was about making this movie, one of Kinooper's earliest and best international color releases, to make it more accessible to the masses. And that succeeded admirably. The general public would not sit still to make a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt when played by a typical 300-pound tenor and soprano with vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful leading actors (a young Loren, the pretty Della Marra and a devious Mrs. Maxwell) who make the story more believable and give those who are unfamiliar with the plot or the music a better chance to get into the World to come beautiful arias that could not be otherwise. All in all a charming introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember the way I saw it in middle school, and it certainly aroused my interest in the opera, a form I was unfamiliar with at the time. I still enjoy watching this movie and recommend it to anyone who appreciates the great music accompanied by above-average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was an outstanding man as Radames, and unfortunately the audience did not appear in any other film.
