I'm not sure how I missed this movie when it came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This movie is set in and around the 19th century red-light district of Okabasho. Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of Japan's Samurai Code. <br /> <br /> It is unique Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he could make this film, his adaptation of the script shows. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is well-known and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. The characters may turn around each other, but the caste system remains intact as each character returns to the world in which he belongs. The samurai warrior, who drives into the world of good-hearted and affectionate prostitutes, returns to his life as she sets herself on a world another road with a man who is part of her caste system. Many value the world of samurai above all others, but it is the lower caste dwellers who can support each other and love without restraint. The samurai in this film proves to be the weak, while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It's a story of women's survival in feudal Japan. At that time, men were considered survivors, the strong, while women were considered just mindless and weak possessions. This film shows the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they needed to survive and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching" to everyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not a fan. It's a nice, calm and soul-holding movie that should be appreciated for every movie collection.
