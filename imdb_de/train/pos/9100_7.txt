Spanish films are in, albeit not golden, definitely a silver age. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the emotions are strong or almost at life or death levels, they are still not really melodramatic. This could happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories that are linked together. One is about the backward girl who does not dare to cross the road to the next block. One is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another topic is the girl with drug problems whose lover she leaves. Yet another is about the Madame of a brothel that finds (almost) true love. Definitely worth seeing. In Spain, filmmakers take women seriously.
