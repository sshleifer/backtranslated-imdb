Above average film and acting, partly spoiled by his completely predictable plot. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit into the plot every time. A scent of the "Pleasantville" camp hangs around this strip. As a period piece it is more accurate than not. The depiction of the tragedy of corporate cities and the lack of mobility upwards is sketchy, but moves. Chris Cooper shows a first-class performance as Howard's coal miner.
