I can not remember that this movie got a movie release here. I only saw it when it came to cables. The film deals with the dehumanization of children into killing machines. In particular, a person, the way he replaces and (literally) is released into a world outside the world in which he feels unable to deal with who he really is and what he feels. For me many people expected that this would be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if that would be emotional cripple The scene in which he sits off the field shows this, even though the Decision for two slow repetitions distracts from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie like Bladerunner, Alien and Silent, Logan's Run or THX1138, unfortunately it's the next thing I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> He changes credibly in the film, he does not crack Arnie One's deposits, he does not turn into Snake Plissken and there is no definitive happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie did not go well. It did not follow the formula, and for an American target audience 18-25 years old this was unforgivable, as it was not what they expected. Fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
