I did not have any more films to borrow, and picked up Freebird. I fought my way through the first third of the movie and wondered if the rest was a waste. Luckily it got really warm and I liked the movie very much. In the second half of the movie I had to smile and laugh all the time. Fortunately, CGI pieces were included, but they were not exaggerated or prevalent. <br /> <br /> But I have to say - the actors all have strong European accent voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and need to order a copy for my own collection.
