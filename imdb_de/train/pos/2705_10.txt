This is a script that Ed Wood has been trying to do for over 10 years. Aris Iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a screenplay that saved Wood from the burning house at the expense of other, temporary valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a dialogue free of dialogue that some people describe as stupid. In fact, it's a pretty loud movie, without the indecent chatter of most flicks. In the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects provide a rich sound experience that works better than any other shotgun from the Hollywood mill, especially the stupid boat movie in which Billy Zane was last ("Attention!"), "Oh no . " ! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I'm going to take Zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunt in this film every day over empty dialogues. Billy Zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci shines as usual and the gods shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schr√∂der, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy's name on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set is exquisite, and Ron Perlman's bestial performance is just wonderful. Overall, it's a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and cinenephile. A must for anyone who really loves movies, as the world-class Iliopulos and its performers obviously do. A movie in which you wish you had done it yourself.
