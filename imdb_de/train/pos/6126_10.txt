I saw Jack Frost at Â£ 4: 00 in my local shop, and I thought it looked good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and I was right, it was good. For starters, this movie is a killer snowman. This is something to laugh about and the look was funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine and the lines that Jack Frost said I had to laugh: "I just made you smoke" and "The worlds that put the most of the snow cones" , The story at the beginning was pretty funny and too stupid. "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack rubbed his eyes with candle sticks." If you're looking for a B-movie comedy horror that's full of puns, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
