This film is a lyrical and romantic memory, told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy who lived in a rural Cuban town in the year of the Castro revolution. It's obviously a real, worthy work of love. <br /> <br /> The terms CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to falsely market this as an action film. DREAMING OF JULIA makes a lot more sense. It has more to do with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is just an inconvenience to people's daily lives and activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works that deal with this period in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice-over narrator undermines the story, but the film makes up for that with unqualified clips from Hollywood movies that visually say much more than the narrator could. <br /> <br /> The comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO are a fair game as the movie becomes melancholic in terms of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> Like the movie JULIE, the revolution never seems to come to an end.
