The freedom to have your own Sea Going Power Boat, the excitement of experiencing underwater adventures, is a rugged man, an adventurous and lovable (and so well-equipped!) Wizard in fine bikinis, all selling arguments for "SEA HUNT" (1958 -61). <br /> <br /> What was the reason for producing a kind of "gun for hire" series? Let's take a close look now. There must be some hints. <br /> <br /> If we just look back a little, we see the RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER! (1955). Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson played a quartet of very attractive adventurers working on the Caribbean rescue, including a Pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was moderately successful and was not necessarily memorable for its story regarding the look of those responsible in bathing suits. Fine, shapely women folk in some really sharp 2-piece swimsuits (woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a plus for the boys. and the presence of robust, athletic men posing their "best poses" appeals to the Gals as well. <br /> <br /> And there is one element that is a true heir to this old RKO feature. It's included on the soundtrack between the queues and themes of the music. It is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this insturmental or song (with lyrics) will not forget it so soon. The Carribbean beat is very lively and the brass section of the orchestra is very rich and instantly makes an impression and memory. The 45 RPM record of this song has made it into the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many Saturday evenings on NBC's "YOUR HIT PARADE". We can not remember how many weeks it has been. (Maybe someone can fill us in with this one article!) So we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey when we entered "the Tube". The public had dealt with UNDERWATER! All right, but would you choose a TV series? <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions had a reputation for releasing a type of product that was largely unregistered by the networks for multi-station connection treatment. But they had achieved some great success with Television Syndication. ** By that we mean to offer a series for stations for one TV station per market area. (Like the various Newspaper syndicates, they "sell" comic strips to various papers across the country and even the world.) So we were Mike Nelson in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges, Mr. Bridges been in action for about 15 years, and in some Boston Blackie films (with Chester Morris) had shown some memorable performances in mostly supportive and very different roles on THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951) Lloyd's characterization was very convincing, along with a fine, convincingly athletic physique. He has the look of a man who makes money with his physical abilities He has taken the Diver's Diver very well, whether he's aboard a ship or underwater. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did it Take on the role quickly, but unlike many misinformation out there, he was unfamiliar with SCUBA before landing this Mike Nelson concert. But the athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a fast learner, with so many close-ups under water that there was no doubt that Lloyd was the mask, the bubbler, and the fin-fins. <br /> <br /> Stories were almost always about helping a customer for a fee, much like a private detective. What if the customer was a pretty lady who looked good in a bathing suit, so much the better. <br /> <br /> Like many of the other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV productions, "SEA HUNT" was fined. Spectacular Opening Theme and Closing, along with some original music and queues. <br /> <br /> At some point I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the first syndicated television series, a success the ZIV series had previously known, such as "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the scene of this underwater legend, it was shown here in Chicago late into the night (after 10:30 pm) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I can just remember who the original sponsor was in this particular market. And there were even commercials shot by the star! How well can we remember and introduce Lloyd as Mike Nelson on his Power Boat? And when we were invited to return the next week and "..... another adventure of" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, the creators of Old Style Lager!", Meanwhile poked Mike addressed us and raised an old-style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your moving boat, we'll tell the Coast Guard!) Then the boat leaves the dock, accompanied by the Sea Hunt Theme and rolls the credits. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More than literally, Mike was hired and it all ended up as a terrible story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** ZIV's syndicated achievements included "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT". (and his clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** Of course SCUBA is an abbreviation for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
