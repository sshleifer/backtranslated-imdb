This is one of the scariest, scariest, and heartbreaking horror movies ever! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family move into a new home together with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Everything seems to be normal until Dr. Creed loses one of his patients who had him A terrible head injury. Then he is tormented by the ghost, who knows how Victor brings him to Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come to life. Louis did not know if all this was just a dream and is talking to Ellie, who was worried that her cat might be killed in a truck, and later tells Rachel Louis that it's really hard for her because of her sister Talking to Zelda who was really sick (as we see in a flashback how sick her sister is) That was really and this is one of the scariest scenes ever!) The next day, Louis receives a phone call from Jed, in which he says his cat was killed by a truck and Jed gets him to place where Victor the Ghost said he does not go! And the cat is buried, his wife and children go to their grandparents, and Louise is alone at home when she sees that the cat is back. Now it looks bad, so he goes to Jed and Jed tells him he's buried his dog too (as we've seen other flashbacks) later in the movie The Family Out Picnic is played Gage plays with dragons and Gage says I'll drop it, "the wind blows near the Rute Road, where a truck passes by, Gage approaches the road, Louis races to get him, the hottest scene in a horror movie with the jaw on the floor or Shivers will go down your back when you hear Louis screaming. Soon he misses him so much that Louis Gage is buried in the same spot where the cat is buried. <br /> <br / > The scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not that far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and the acting of all was great! 10 out of 10
