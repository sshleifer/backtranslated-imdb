If you plan to see this, be sure to check out the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to go back and then look at the scenes manipulated by censorship), it makes a HUGE difference. The film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced into prostitution by her own father since she was 14 years old. If her father suddenly dies, she can go out alone. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophy of life, she uses her sexuality to make men give her what she wants, leaving her in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if she has any sense of morality at all. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect in a black and white movie. Although no sexual acts are explicitly shown on the screen, it is obvious what is going on in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I think most modern viewers will at least enjoy it, especially with the films shocking. While I've been watching, I thought the tempo in the parts seemed a bit slow, but I think most of the movies show them the first time. Actually, I think that almost all the movies I made in the early '30s had a little bit of a tempo problem or just did not really "flicker" certain parts. This was probably just the craft of filmmaking not quite perfected. it would only take a few more years. Compare a film from 1939 and compare it to a movie from the early 1930s. I think you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again I am very happy that I could see the original cut. it really makes a big difference. Even John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this film before he became famous in an unusual role.
