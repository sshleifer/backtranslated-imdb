I read some horrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confusing, confused, terribly structured." Although some of these allegations are beneficial, this movie was not nearly as horrible as an average DVD programmer. In fact, it actually had aspirations. It has tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And with God there are some interesting things. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Barbeau is a miracle that you can see. She is wearing the film on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY finally collapses under the weight of his own ambition. There are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. And the plot gaps that have arisen through time travel are never really addressed: For example, if Hope knows that her mother is evil and she will eventually kill her brother, why does not she kill Ma in the first sequence of the film? It seems hell has condemned to travel to the future to do it. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I give HAPPY points for the attempt. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
