I did not expect to like this movie like me. I only got it because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look very good. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this is one of the most skillfully composed films of recent memory. It is a twenty-year-old woman who wants to know everything. It stores all collected information in a huge archive. She experiments with experiences in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown filming the movie, and we see their reactions to the story and each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented the film from being screened in the US while appealing the Customs indictment. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary film that shows us the world of filmmakers behind the scenes during the story, with the fourth wall broken. This movie is the most direct way to make a movie I've ever seen. The film works mostly as a time capsule of the 1960s, psychedelic processes, freedom struggles and sexual liberation. I think about it a lot more. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This movie is a buried treasure. Try it.
