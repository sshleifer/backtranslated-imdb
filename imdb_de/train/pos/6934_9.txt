Winchester '73 is a great story, and I like it. It is no ordinary everyday life - it uses a rifle to separate hands from different characters - as a mechanism to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a superb man of heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a girl struggling with the realities of her husband and the Wild West. It is important to pay attention to these politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this film without remorse. By today's standards it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and it's worth to see it. Enjoy!
