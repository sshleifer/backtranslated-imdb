The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. "The Grifters," a good movie, far superior, this movie truly remained true to the pulp fiction / film noir roots that made the story. I recommend this movie to all movie noir fans.
