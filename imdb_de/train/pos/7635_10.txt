I've seen this movie many times and I have to tell you, I enjoyed it every time. This is in my opinion Belushi's summit film. Belushi and Lovitz are so sympathetic and identifiable with the simple man that you can not help but get involved as soon as you start watching. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already big and others just started. It is billed as a feel-good film, and that's exactly what it is. This movie shows you that life is not always that bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things from a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate the things you have and you will also smile. In my opinion, you can not ask for much more from a movie, not to mention that it's a hilarious movie and you never lose interest. Very very underrated movie here people. <br /> <br /> Rating of me: 10 I'm out !!!
