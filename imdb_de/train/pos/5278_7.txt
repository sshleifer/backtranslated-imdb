What begins as a generational conflict in this film ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The film winds its way through Europe, the father and the young son are in a car over 3000 miles. The cramps force lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to collide. There really is no clear winner. In the end everything counts as experience, experience in several layers of life. For those who are interested in Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle perspective without pushing the agenda. The story of the young son grows up, his rebellious and rebellious nature becomes open to more forms of life.
