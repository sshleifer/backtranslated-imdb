I'm writing this 9 years after the last episode aired, and I'm still excited about the impact Wildside had on me. <br /> <br /> It has effectively come to where numerous other police drama has gone and been successful. But it went on and did not move away from the realism of the streets. Often, life events and characters up to a T were represented. I miss this series painfully, instead we have given the stupid "Underbelly" is overly dramatized and has produced a lot of American garbage. Wildside has remained true to the uniqueness of Sydney, and I am truly committed to this wonderful series. The acting was A-grade and it's a shame to see that few actors have developed their careers while others are forgotten. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of TV history, so I ask the ABC to release the full series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
