********* Ten out of ten stars ******** <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe it's a TV movie. Only the sentence "from television" makes me shudder. The production values ​​for television films are almost always well below the production values ​​for professional film studios. However, this version of the "Christmas story" should appear in theaters because it is so good. It's my personal favorite among all the "Christmas Carol" films because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are a few minor glitches on the screen where two of the ghosts visit Scrooge, but there is no film that does not contain at least a few bugs that excels as a Scrooge, it's a pleasure to see them. In fact, in this movie, I can not think of any idea that should not be applauded. The costumes, filming and winter scenery are fascinating. The music score is adorable and heart warming. In addition, there is a sound direction, flawless cinematography and faithful scripting. we have something here one day as a holiday classic. It really was not long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day it will be soon. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness, and giving. In a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol" with George C. Scott.
