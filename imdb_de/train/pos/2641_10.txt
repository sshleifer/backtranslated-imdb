Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film showed the lack of respect of the soldiers during this time. Historically, the end of the Vietnam War has given us all something to remember that we can remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this movie and he earned the credits he received by writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or not at all. This movie is a kind of film that should be shown on television every year, much like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of a man to his lost son is totally moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to meet him. Rocky
