If you have not enjoyed this movie, your dead are either hate or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An outstanding cast, all of whom have performed well. This movie proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor despite the critics. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then made some bad movies, then broke into 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then Click and now Reign Over Me. > Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The family closest to him is a mother-in-law and a father-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) has encountered him, he seems to change his life. I will not say more because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I strongly recommend this movie. One of the best films of the year 2007.
