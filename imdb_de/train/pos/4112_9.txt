The title is "onomatopoeic," the sound of a streetcar clanging on the rails. It is metaphorical for anyone who can not have the people who live in the dump. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passing tram, which represents the relatively inaccessible life of the middle class. The pathos of the little boy and his beloved, but sadly crazy father are very touching. This was Kurosawa's first film in color, and he uses beautifully shocking hues, colors that can only be seen in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the underlying force, but Kurosawa, as always, focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of a genius of cinema.
