Although Cher and Cage are the focus of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them - here will be Loretta and Ronny in 50 years - still in love. The whole cast does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Although I have seen this a long time ago, I am glad that it eventually catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From the music to the scenes at the opera to the arguments at the kitchen table - this is a very entertaining movie.
