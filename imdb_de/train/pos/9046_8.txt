I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) some time ago, and since then I've seen every one of his films arriving on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he's even a little bit like Owen) just seeping from the screen. I'm sure he'll one day crack an Oscar if he gets some meaty roles ... <br /> <br /> That's not meant to denigrate this movie. <br /> <br /> nice story, with very credible people (well, it's based on the author's early shenanigans with rockets), a great cast? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my watch list? with the right mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and the awesome soundtrack with so many rock 'n' roll oldies to get your feet beating: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Like him, I looked up at the night stars to see Sputnik as he scurried through the blackness. Like Homer, I experimented with rockets in my garden and even used the same chemicals as fuel. and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts ending in an explosive catastrophe! What a fun it was ... <br /> <br /> I did not reach his big (metaphorical and physical) heights. But that's what you find out when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it with the kids: they will all have a lot of good laughs.
