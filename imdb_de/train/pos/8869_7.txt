In this little movie we have some great characters, but a very flat plot. It's really nice to see because Singleton introduces the esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This lets the viewer forget the nonexistent realism for which this movie is supposedly meant. In fact, here we have all sorts of clich√©s and stereotypes placed on celluloid at a higher rate than soap. Not a deep movie (though it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
