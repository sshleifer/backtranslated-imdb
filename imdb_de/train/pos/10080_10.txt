In the rapid economic development of China in the 1990s, there is a revival of traditional Chinese culture, partly because of the rise of nationalism, which is associated with increasing wealth, and above all because of the sense of spiritual affiliation after the collapse of the Old Socialist ideology in the United States post-cultural revolutionary era. <br /> <br /> However, the resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, Confucianism, was not without catastrophes because the Chinese took over the entire tradition without removing the bad part. and the discrimination of girls in this film is a great example. In addition, not only the part that should be discarded was inherited, the good part that was to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing the face, was inherited in the revival is ignored and threatened with extinction. The director used this film to critique the problem of the resumption of tradition by contemporary China. This is the deeper meaning behind the film.
