I recently bought one of these fantastic shows, and even after watching three episodes, I'm still fascinated by the sleek styling of the animation and the slow but thought-provoking actions of storytelling. I'm still a fan ..... with a little bit of pain. <br /> <br /> Although this installation in the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish satirical way to tell about the wrong I have to say that the war is a bit too lenient dramatically, if he goes on to explain the life of the main characters and their unrelenting need to complain about everything that happens, and what they have to do to stop the OZ group from realizing their plans (especially the character named Wufei) ... I mean, he whines more than an American character in a soap opera.) Counselor, is not he? <br /> <br /> Apart from the exaggerated drama (I think that's mainly due to the dubbing of English dubbers), this series is still very exciting and will fascinate me once again. I mean, it can always be worse. It could be like the last episode, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about gentle-dramatic ... I'll talk about that later.
