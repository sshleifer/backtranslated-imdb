Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad you just have to laugh and acting, let's say it's not Mel Gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a policeman, is so damn bad that he'll be fine. I do not know how, but he himself makes this movie a 10. You have to see it when your horror / slash movies make it bloody and funny at the same time. Killer Movie
