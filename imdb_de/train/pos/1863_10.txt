ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young, emotionally disturbed US Navy sailor. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him recognize that his problems are due to his childhood. <br /> <br /> Get ready to shed one or two tears. The film could thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story that comes to a positive conclusion from something terrible that happens to everyone. ANTWONE FISHER is a strong movie, especially about forgiveness. Other important topics that make you think are child abuse, adoption and care. <br /> <br /> Oscar-winner Denzel Washington does an impressive job making his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I liked to see. These included the beginning (dreams of a little boy - check out the giant pancakes!) And the end (dreams became reality) that beautifully connected the story. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene took place when the doctor asked Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his family who had left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene took place when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their roles well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the responsibilities of the Management, Mr. Washington continues to show why he has won an Oscar and is successful in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Derek Luke has shown why he was so right for Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real and heartbreaking work. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played the role of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, resembled a sunbeam on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a despicable character, deserves special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress playing Fischer's mother showed a great performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
