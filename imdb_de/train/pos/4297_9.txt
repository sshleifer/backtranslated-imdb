Every now and then a filmmaker brings a unique group of people to life and lets them see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did that again. I always had the feeling that the BB Cill was the anthem of her age and he managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. From time to time we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life, and we often blow it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life as a result of this decision. The juxtaposition of small and big events that show us that the most trivial things we care about are really awesome. I've seen this movie several times and am always surprised how deeply the emotions go through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline play their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martin's portrayal of a movie manager is priceless. Thanks again, Mr Kasden
