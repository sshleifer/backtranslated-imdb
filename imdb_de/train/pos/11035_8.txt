Four prisoners share a single cell: the dominant transvestite Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus' idiot, a brave buddy, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who had fallen into corporate fraud and is now concentrating on the run. After a brick has fallen from the wall of the cell, the men discover the Hidden Diary written by a serial "Fountain Well" obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this diary the secret of her escape? Or is there something more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a bit tired of getting into this movie, because the only other experience I've had with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008) I The film is the worst, I have ever seen. Much of what was wrong with One Missed Call, however, could probably be traced back to Klavan's terrible screenplay, because (as I recall) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless he wanted to include the baby) , In any case, Maléfique was a great way to win back my respect. , , It's a French movie (obviously something I like) and it takes place in prison (this is my second favorite cudgel after hospitality). So that's two points for him before the movie even starts. Luckily, Valette had me after the end of the movie. Maléfique is a pretty deep, rather complex, quite compelling story of obsession and despair. , , the desire and the need to bring fantasies into reality. It's not a horrible movie in the traditional sense, but the strangeness of its power makes it damned scary. The time between climax and graduation was one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with pretty cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 8.5 / 10. A certain respect that Valette has received back. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has taken over the rights to an American remake (surprise). I'm not sure why, to be honest, as this does not look like something that would be a great moneymaker here in the States. But I was surprised once before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
