What a wonderful movie. The characters were not only alive, but lived and reflected the everyday life and the quarrel within a family. Each character brought a unique personality into the story, which could easily connect the audience with someone they know from their own family or their close circle of friends into the drama, the laughter and the tears as the plot of the movie develops to incorporate and be a part of it. The script is well suited for capturing the characters' common emotions, actions, and reactions to conflict, opinion, and determination. <br /> <br /> No epic, but it's a very nice movie that you can see with your loved ones. Many knowing nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
