This movie surprised me! Since I had never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to see this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in the John Woo style! Normally, I am very careful when this is claimed! There is only one John Woo and until today there was no director who comes close to his brilliance in action! The fact that "Moon Child" had a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with the flaming vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this movie, the tempo was considerably slower! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some nice action scenes in Hong Kong style! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to each other! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt are good actors and are very credible friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A few times the film seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to be skipped! Example: When a member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the film skips nine years and most friends are no longer together! Even without a good reason son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know that this is done to add a serious drama! Because of the actors, it is very effective, but sometimes it feels compelled! Aside from the mistakes in the plot, this movie has an ambiance and slickness that make it hard not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it is just like that! The overall experience you receive is heartwarming and sincere!
