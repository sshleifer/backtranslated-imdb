I saw this movie with a special screening of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's so interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the most important independent African filmmaker in the world. I'm not talking about black filmmakers, I'm talking about filmmakers rooted in culture. The idea of ​​whether anything at all demonstrates the diversity and variety of African themes is an African theme with its film 500 Years Later. But the idea does not fit into this form. Show the artistic diversity. The film is a purely African cast, but the theme is a human issue that most of us could address. I love the mild comedy. And the Kora by Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it's really an art house gem.
