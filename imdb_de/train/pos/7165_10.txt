I recorded that a long time ago but just watched it today. I was sick so I did not have any more stuff to look at! I am so glad that I saw it and that I could clear my memory and see it again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes at Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back to the past and at the end of the film we see what connections exist. Some people have said that this is a children's movie. I do not agree - it could be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There were moments when my spine tingled. The story is unlike any other movie, full of adventure. I just ordered the book from Amazon, I can not wait!
