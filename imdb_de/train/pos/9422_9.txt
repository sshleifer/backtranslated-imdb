When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films that I thought I'd see again. What a wonderful, droll commentary the movie has been after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the movie have to be considered favorites of life.
