Cinderella is one of Disney's biggest movies. One of those movies that I think you appreciate the older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I think the movie was the biggest of his films at the time of its release. The characters have been made larger than previous films, creating more depth to better appreciate the characters. Cinderella herself, in my opinion, is one of the greatest characters Disney has ever created. With her friendliness and her dry humor she is extremely sympathetic; However, it is the inspiration she gives that makes her unforgettable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, holding on to her dreams and never giving up. Even in the most adverse situations, her dreams persist and she can not be taken away by anyone. Your example should serve as an inspiration to all and encourage you to never let go of your dreams.
