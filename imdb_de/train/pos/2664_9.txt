Although The Shining is more than a quarter of a century old, I challenge everyone not to go crazy with Jack Nicholson's fall into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has succeeded in demolishing it. instead it was referenced again and again in pop culture. The twins, the bloodlift, RedRum, the crazy nonsense "writing" ... this, though not different, should be seen to understand all the allusions in daily life. At the same time the film is scary, exciting, beautiful and psychologically fascinating. It has the classic secret of Hitchcock and the horror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.
