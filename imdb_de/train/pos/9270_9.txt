Before reading this review, I must point out that this is in no way a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something, then hopefully you will see against politicians in general ... but if you are offended. .. I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb information for this movie). What a pity, because the movie is great. If it were not for "Grbavica", this film would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Rightly so (it was second place or second place, if you will). Why? Because it's a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women's issue. The point is that the government is trying to keep people in check. An analogy that is so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But the ban will not solve anything and / or make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great summary: "Comedy about a tragedy," that sums it up pretty well!
