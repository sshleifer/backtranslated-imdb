Not so many people like Bertrand blier's movies simply because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived under a deep despair with great personal hope, it may be difficult for you to enjoy the humor shown here. <br /> <br /> And also the film of Blier can not simply be classified as black comedy or cult etc. like that of Pulp Fiction etc. Because there is this delicacy that the North American audience often does not appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two 'hooligans' who dine with Jeanne Moreau at the beach restaurant, I felt they were more gentile than any gentleman could have been. <br /> <br /> This is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of a pointless symbol that the Camion suddenly produces on the Carrefour. <br /> <br /> So, Les Valseuses is a better name than going places. To dance a valse you have to be elegant, but places you can not go to.
