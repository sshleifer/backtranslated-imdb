In life we ​​first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way we will find space between them to fit into smaller stones, our little necessities. If you trade in reverse, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who could not organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first feature film Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, contradictory trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954 -): Everyone is anxious to remove the stones that persistently appear on their way or, worse, in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas looking for Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera), who also plays in "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia".
