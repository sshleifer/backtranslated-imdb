This film does not make any intrusive effort to hide its true genre - a Campy B movie. It will explain you the definition of Campy at the beginning. There should also have been the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this film in a way that makes you go, "Hmmmmm ... that's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, there is a scene in "16th Century Japan" that shows a couple of samurai running in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple, several tourists in slippers and shorts look into the distance. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent, bearable, oh my lord, but that makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and find others really terrible. I have to digress a bit because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she's fantastic. Her airtime in the movie was pretty short though. I've seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits, and he's better in the theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie if you have nothing to do on a weekday night.
