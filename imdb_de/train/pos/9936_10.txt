This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcaster decided to resend it a couple of summers ago when I finished my first medical semester. I was surprised to see the depth at which the organs were explained. Sure, some things are simplified, but most of it was right (though it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that all prospective medical students should see this. This is a very good way to learn, for example, some of the basic medical words. Now I'm in the 7th semester and I think I'll watch the show again as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
