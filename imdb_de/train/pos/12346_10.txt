This is a very beautiful and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Magnificent music score. I was in Japan twice last year and the film gave me that typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is excellent, as are the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese are very sensitive and friendly and it's all brought to the screen very well. The director plays brilliantly with light and colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you want to see more of the same director. It is a real feel-good film that I can only recommend to everyone.
