Foley's Noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film seems to fit "perfectly" together. Shot by shot, cut by cut, the film unfolds around a troubled boxer who discovers his own purpose (or lack thereof). The other comments may indicate a lack of interest in Pulpa, but I personally think that this is an excellently compiled movie piece!
