Those who know who knows the Kelly legend and hopes that this film could be an accurate reflection of his life might be disappointed with the creative license that was recorded with this film (eg, the character of Naomi Watt never exist in reality) Just think of it as a conversation, it holds up pretty well. Ledgers performance in the title role is pretty solid and takes the coat of the best Ned of the cinema (not heavy considering the previous Ned's are Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton Champion (Australian Rules Football)) Bob Chitty, a great footballer though a bad actor. Some filming in the area I live in, Bacchus Marsh outside of Melbourne and Clunes & Ballarat.
