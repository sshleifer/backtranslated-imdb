In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer that can replace actors and writers. Unfortunately, this kind of "character-driven" movie is far too rare nowadays. Duvall's performance and James Earl Jones are true to the high expectations of their audience. I wonder if this movie was made for television? It has a "close-up" of narrative personal quality. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding. The only thing stopping them from being a masterpiece of cinema is the lack of great cameraman, but beautiful pictures are not all. How can talents like Jones and Duvall continue to do such a good job at a time when actors are posing for digitization?
