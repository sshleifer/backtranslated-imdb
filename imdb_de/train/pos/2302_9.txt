The first outing of Reese Witherspoon on the big screen was unforgettable. She looks like a freshly scrubbed face "Tween", light and stringy, but undeniably Reese. <br /> <br /> I always liked her as an actress and had no idea that she started this young career with her career. I actually earned some respect for Reese to know who she was so early. I say that because whenever I've seen her performance, the characters so far, in every performance, she also seemed to have her own personality that lived with that character, quite nice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first movie experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody that Reese made with Kiefer Sutherland. Somehow I assumed it was her first time "at bat". Not so well done, Reese
