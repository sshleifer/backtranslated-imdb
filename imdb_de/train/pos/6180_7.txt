During the opening night of the Vanties, a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. As the show continues, the police are trying to match who killed and why before the final blind. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery. Unfortunately, nobody told me anything about the musical numbers that go on and on. While the numbers are certainly the type that Hollywood made on its glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much put the movie to a standstill despite attempts to weave action around it. That would not be so bad if the music was reasonably decent, but not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew they had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a big production number, the Vanities finale, and background music in the background. I do not think Spike Jones and His City Slickers have ever played it that often. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen playing well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scenes as an actor who falls in love with the wardrobe mistress. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this if you think you can see through the musical numbers or be prepared to scan through them. It's a funny movie they do not do anymore.
