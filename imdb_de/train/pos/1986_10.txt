A tour deforce! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a bit too cute! Starting with the great cinematography, the colors, the costumes and the most impressive performances, this film is a must. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but it is above all and a musical in itself! It is a masterful Fagan who never leaves his character to make a song. You never really know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions, you hate him from start to finish. Bill Sykes ... if you read the book, it's a mean one, and so he is in this movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife led this masterpiece. I went there and saw his last movie, Gladiator, because of his many good performances, not to see the headliners. The music suits the times and the mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
