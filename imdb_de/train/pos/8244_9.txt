Loved it! What is not to like? - You have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have your social dilemmas, you have a fine retro 1950's style meat meal that is kept in the bay by a troubled concern whether it's your next meal the upper crust are. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante for social climbing housewives. She is both willful and criminally conspiratorial. The dream of every k'sun is really great because the son just tries to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeds. He is a real screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious cop with sharpened instincts and little squeamishness, as if it were his everyday personality. Billy Connolly is adorable as Fido. A good actor: I wish he played the title role in "Braveheart" with Gibson directing. My feeling is that his William Wallace has come closer to the real character. His Fido is reserved and yet accessible. A nice gesture. <br /> <br /> In short, a great and wonderful satirist who deals with morality, values, social pinning, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A real reality show.
