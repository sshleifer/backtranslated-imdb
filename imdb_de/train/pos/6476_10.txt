Several posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex dramas. Crime is essentially trivial, so payout is always anti-climactic, while a detailed depiction affects human drama. The author used a number of smart devices to work around this, but was not completely successful. Answers to exactly what happened and why was delivered, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels cheated a bit. <br /> <br /> But in a sense this is unimportant. The drama was never about the crime or even the investigation, it was about the impact of the events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such, it was gripping. The writing was a significant cut above the mill run for the primetime drama and the performances were equally good. In an ensemble piece, it's stubborn to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves a special mention for an extraordinary show of strength as a mother-and-wife daughter, and Janet McTeer was a hardened old policewoman in a cracked shape. > <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of the breed, like the elephant in the room, which no one is prepared to mention. Subtle, powerful things.
