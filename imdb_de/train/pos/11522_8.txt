I've wanted to see that for a long time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie, I thought it was a great wrap, even though it's starting to pull. The acting and the direction were great. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow beyond the script. The only thing that caught my attention was sometimes the fact that Claire Forlani, the most beautiful woman in the world, was in the cast. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
