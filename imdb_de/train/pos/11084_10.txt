<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old. I annoyed my parents to bring me back three times. I searched it on video about five years ago and finally found a copy on an online auction site, but I'd like to see it either picked up by a new distributor and re-released (I understand that the original video run was small ) or the rights of The Family Channel, Disney etc. and have regularly shown. It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the struggle for life of a family of foxes in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. The excellent soundtrack complements the movie well. It would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offers that children's films offer today.
