Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspires others too. <br /> <br /> The acting was excellent and my wife and I visited Lea Thompson years later in the cabaret because she played in the movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident has delayed and injured the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is upon us. I knew one of the Challenger astronauts since childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus where my dad went to school; I also know a close friend of the deceased pilot. <br /> <br /> Last year I was the National BSA technical review for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge and I still think Spacecamp is a great movie to recommend to scouts. Space related merit badges that I teach. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I met the deceased astronaut again and followed a schedule of engineering education we had put together when Challenger exploded. I eventually sat with Willard Rockwell and his engineers "invisible," and happened to be the result of the accident at the Astrotech Shareholders' Meeting, so I'm much closer to the accident and the similarities with the movie. I made sure I was a good student and, four years later, strangely graduated on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer, who told them in 1986 they should not fly Challenger and later build Endeavor.
