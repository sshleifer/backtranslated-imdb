I thought the kids did a very good job on the show. I especially enjoyed the idea of ​​the Emma figure. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to watch and enjoy the movie without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her. Even the ghostly apparitions of the released souls of the children were good. Another good point of the movie is that it kept moving. There were not many slow scenes. The adult leads were also believable and helped keep the show entertaining. All in all, a pleasant night of the movie.
