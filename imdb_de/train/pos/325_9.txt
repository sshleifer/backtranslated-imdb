This is a great movie - especially when compared to the sometimes arduous seriousness of today's politically minded filmmakers. A film that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the optimistic optimism of the 1960s can not be regained, we can at least learn a lesson from the airy energy and charm of the film. I do not know what the people who call the movie "boring" saw - it's packed so much that it never stays the same way for more than 15 minutes.
