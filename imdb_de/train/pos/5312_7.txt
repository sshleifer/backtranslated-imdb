Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a great couple and show it with their unique charisma expressed in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the typical "alternative" or indie movie with an action that has a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy with an old camera. His biggest hobby is photographing the exotic inhabitants of the small town he lives in. Suddenly, an alternative artist pays attention to him and hire him to show his work at major festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life is changing dramatically, as happiness and fame seem to upset the city's inhabitants, who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets angry because he does not give her the "proper" attention now. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an indie movie with an advantage, but not for everyone. It may be boring or overbearing for some people, but I think it's worth it just because it offers something "different" from Hollywood's typical standards. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell: This is the typical Christina Ricci and John Waters movie. That was it. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are really annoying. My goodness.
