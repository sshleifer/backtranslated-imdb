Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted. That's how easy it is, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in creating a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow-motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots etc. in a nice, smooth way. This gives the movie a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is about the life of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common, except one thing: a party that everyone participates in, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this image is not the question of how the characters interact (compared to a similar, of course better movie like Magnolia). I just do not think that was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the various details of the experiences people go through who determine or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling these little stories that describe small experiences. He knows the people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but no surprise, as we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to a sunny, smooth feeling of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop / rock tunes that give some scenes the power they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one mistake and that is the last half hour. Was it the term that broke me apart? Or were the last scenes not as fresh and exactly as the scenes until then? I can not understand ... <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful sunny movie that pushes up Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (It's the breeze that flows through the hair of a girl on a sunny afternoon, making it even more beautiful, it's the fresh breeze that relaxes you when you pass a crowded party when someone opens the door, the perfume of this beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park and whom you met a week ago, it's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
