I saw this little Belgian gemstone two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Do not fool yourself: puberty is a roller coaster ride, whether Americans or Europeans. "Naissance of the Pieuvres" (or as it is called in the US "Water Lillies") is a story about a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson), looks cool and withdrawn girl, that would like to be in school's swim team just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more attracted to Floriane. Among all this, Marie's rather clumsy, unattractive girlfriend Anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we will be shown the usual set of teenage activities (broken heart, shoplifting, alcohol and / or drug use, occasional sex, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes some time to get into your system (Michael Bay fans, note: the tempo is slow, so steer clear), but if you do not have a problem with it, Water Lillies is a charmer. No rating here but would pull down a hard "R" due to adult language, nudity and situations.
