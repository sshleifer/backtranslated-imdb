As a kid, I loved computer animation, although it was EXTREMELY limited and the tools almost did not exist. This film, as I sat awestruck and saw amazing pictures and almost hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer. This is a complete package between music and video that really makes a double sack. If you know a child who wants to engage in computer animation, this is a MUST. <br /> <br /> I still call this movie, almost 20 years later, one of my top 3 favorites. I think the originality is still unsurpassed by most of today's McMovies, who spit on Hollywood. At the moment I want to see if I can do it myself. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then this movie deserves a lot of imitation =)
