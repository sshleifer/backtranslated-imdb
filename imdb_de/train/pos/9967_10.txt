There are some things I will never understand. why underwear comes in threes, if that is clearly not enough, is an example. Similarly, I'll never understand this movie, and that's brilliant. As you approach this movie and expect a real movie, you can also approach Satan and wait for a hug. But that may be possible if you welcome the satanic characters of this film. Take pitch for example; the most ineffectual, unhealthiest depiction of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten-foot Satan costume of red body color and horns covered with condoms. It does, however, create some of the funniest moments in a movie that ever existed. Seriously, that's not an understatement. The same can be applied to any other character. The little girl, who looks so sickly innocent, is likely to overcompensate a serious crime in which she is involved. If Santa's Inter-Space Recon Station is real, there's no chance she could have avoided him for so long. Simply put, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself as a serious buff. The extremely funny characterization, the drama, the concept and the almost under the radar racism make this film an absolute must when it comes to any movie (if you're after pure laughter).
