A widely underrated black comedy, the best in a series of Grand Guignol films following Baby Jane. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young, convicted killers (an allusion to "coercion") who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for budding movies, a bunch of unconscious children who are visited by terrible stage mothers. Debbie, in her blond wig ("I'm a Harlow, you're more of a Marion Davies," she tells Winters), leads the boys at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also makes a deliciously funny tango and overall delivers an outstanding performance, unlike anything she has done so far. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and uncanny. It looks wonderful, with great time detail (30s). Many beautiful blows in Hollywood and the terrible movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a drama coach: "Hamilton Starr," he purrs, "two Rs, but still prophetic." See it and love it.
