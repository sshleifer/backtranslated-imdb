Great fun for adults and kids, this film works on a number of levels: everything from car accidents and face cakes to very good (but subtle) adult jokes. Glenn Close is at her sublimely nasty best as Cruella De Ville ("Call me Ella"). After three years in the Dr. med. Pavlov's Behavior Modification Clinic is she cured of her craving for fur? Even the fur of the puppy skin that she had so much wanted. She even has all her fur coats in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle that inhabits her. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a film of "Dalmatian", without the delusion and machinations of Cruella, and knowing something will change her behavioral change. And now she needs an extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious plans this time around. Ioan Gruffudd is immediately the hero of the film, which runs the shelter "Second Chance". Although he was in Titanic and last year's TV version of Great Expectations (as Pip), I did not recognize him. Well, he was fifth officer Lowe in Titanic, and I did not see Great Expectations, so I'm not too surprised. Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful turn, as the fur farmer of Cruella. He prances and poses in the strangest and most hideous fur clothing you've ever seen? and makes it good. His "Wicked Witch of the West" tribute is funny. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is great, Cruellas is not that bad stooge ?? He was also Alonzo, "Cruellas Butler", in "101 Dalmatians" and you can also recognize him on all Brit coms of the "Black Adder". He plays his usual, awkward, good-natured, somewhat gloomy character with great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscar costumes are generally given for the entire costuming in a movie. That's unfortunate, because the clothes of Glenn Close are incredible. it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is released from the behavioral modification clinic) and deserves such a character. Her clothes alone deserve at least one Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart? The comparison of the film with the original animated film, however, is comparable to the comparison of apples with orangutans: That does not work. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the 1996 film version of "101 Dalmatians". There's a lot to like here: from the visual gags, the dialogue and the costumes to the casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
