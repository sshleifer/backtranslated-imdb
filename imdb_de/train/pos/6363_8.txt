I was quite a fan of the series as a kid, and after that I've always been remembered as one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference to earlier animated series in the early '80s (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois) "Homme. .. of which I love the most) I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind, which were later published, can not match Mazinger Z as they started to repeat the same pattern boring. <br /> < br /> This thing, the novelty, may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is the inventive genius with so many extravagant monsters, weird devices and bizarre characters. Actually we were looking forward to every new episode to find out What kind of devilish or evil machine awaits us!
