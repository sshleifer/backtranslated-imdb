Deathtrap runs like a piece in a movie about who did what to whom, as it mainly plays on a set. The premise is that an accomplished dramatist whose star falls receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student, so he plans to say goodbye to his protégé and adapt his play to his wife's (loud) protests. At least for the first half of the movie. After the halftime, Deathtrap begins with surprising twists and surprises that turn his premise on its head, then directly around and then in a crazy spin, the title always keeping suit. It's an excellent mystery movie that's soaked with humor. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine plays as an older playwright himself in this movie - a slightly crazy and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - he does his usual good job. He gets the best line of Deathtrap he perfectly explains: "What is your definition of success when you get set in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance by playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He may also show his very well-toned body, which he probably kept from the Superman films. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have been working on another movie, one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It's also about a play, though this time Caine is the director and Reeve an actor. Comic veterans include Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the catastrophes that hit the bedstead and the crew of a play. Superficially, the movie looks mostly slapstick, but when you look at it, you realize that these are subtle jokes that require more than one look. I wish this undervalued movie was available on DVD.
