So I will not ruin it for you, I will be very short. There are some great acting and witty lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) realizes that he does not know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for an internship because a friend (Mya) left him as a television producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris), who was wonderfully helped by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana), brought him up to date. They help protect his career and show him the broader possibilities of being a compassionate physician Instead of a player who just wants to make money (as is the case with many of my pre-media friends).
