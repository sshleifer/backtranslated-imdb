I first saw this movie when I was about 13 years old. He blew me away then, and in many ways he still does that today. But I'm less inclined to see it now as an accurate historical piece. There is little effort to investigate and interact with racism - and therefore does not acknowledge that the most powerful weapon against racism is to understand it at the core of those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on one side Beko and Forest in the 3D panorama rainbow view - on the other side two-dimensional characters are portrayed as an unapologetic, unimaginable evil. <br /> <br /> All of this makes great movie history, but it worries me that people view the presentation as "accurate."
