A remarkable documentary about the milestones of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) in Kumba, southwestern Cameroon, on the legal protection of the rights of women and children against domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women according to Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of enforcing secular rights for women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, WLA leaders have recently begun to win a few victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. The leaders of this legislative reform movement are Vera Ngassa Public Prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, Judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain spontaneously recorded material, though I imagine that much, if not all, of this is post-reaction of real events to the camera. Four cases are examined and all the plaintiffs play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated beatings of wives, in one case forced sex; another involves forced sex with a 10-year-old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child at the age of 8 by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also seeks a divorce. We follow the cases from the examination of complaints to the results of the studies. The results are favorable for both women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison sentences and / or fines; The divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive persecution of the child striking the aunt shows that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also worthy of note is the respect with which all parties, including the culprits, are treated. This is a very important and well made movie. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, co-directed the 1998 film Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related topics in Tehran.) (In English with English subtitles). My grade: B + 8/10
