In the opening scene, the eyepatch with Desperado named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but as he follows Johnny into the pueblo, he is shown with a scar over his patched eye. This is just one of many continuity flaws in these edgy "spaghetti" westerns, but instead of affecting the image, it adds a special touch to the process. <br /> <br /> Another case occurs when Sanchez turns his three dead bodies they must be tested for their identity - "One just can not imagine how many false bodies we have in our city". Immediately thereafter, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) appears to pick up his reward with just a profile in hand. <br /> <br /> As for the lead actor Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon) of the film, he is alternately shown with his holster on his right and left hips throughout the movie after exchanging gun straps with Carradine after the brawl in the barroom , Johnny is on his uncle's way to San Margo on the road, but must revenge him by the fraudulent wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her passionate brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes some time to get there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores ever. As for the saloon fight, I got a kick-fu from the kung-fu sound effects every time a hit came. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in more exaggerations? After the duel with Pedro, Johnny for the first time wiped a small amount of blood from his lip to smear Pedro's entire face. Similarly, Pedro cuts off the little Pepe later in the movie, but he does not cut him off, but when Johnny arrives, Pepe's face is covered with blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre that Clint Eastwood does not include. As Johnny, Mark Damon is a decent stall, but without the seething look. Carradine seemed to be a substitute for the obligatory Lee Van Cleef character without being a totally bad guy. At first, the identity exchange between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but by the end of the film everything was interconnected. They knew that every henchman would get his right; The marking time for everyone was part of the anticipation. <br /> <br /> If you ask yourself, the hero of the title has nothing to do with the Nick Adams character from the classic TV Western "The Rebel". In this film, Johnny got his name from a shootout he once had in Yuma. Perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it combined things with the evil Samantha, who played the role of strings behind the scenes. After she has shot Carradine, she beats a hasty retreat before Johnny can take revenge. Still alive, it looks like Carradine is shooting her and missing her, but it does not take long for Johnny and Sanchez to find her in the dessert, where she was killed without water - Carradine aimed at her canteen.
