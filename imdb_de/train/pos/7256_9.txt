I saw the long day of death when he first came out in the cinema. I thought the film gave a good stand for soldiers, he gave a realistic account of men in the war. The action moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines and trying to return to their own ranks with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well-developed and believable. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the lead role with conviction, as does Alan Dobie (as German Helmut). I was surprised that I could not find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I think it has become a forgotten movie, which is sad because it is superior to many other war movies I have seen.
