I saw this as a child in the wonderful world of Disney, so I did not remember much about it. When I looked at it recently, I sat there and thought, "This is the strangest thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> The "traveling" scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly strangely colored / voiced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some things that were not as Disney I've noticed: kids who were threatened with knife pins and prostitutes (during the Portobello Road song). <br /> <br /> It was very entertaining, although the musical numbers were long and I can see little children get bored with them. In addition, the subject was a bit dark, because it was set in World War II.
