An intelligent, stylish and captivating thriller by the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is firmly among his best films! When a restless housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins prostitutes to uncover the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill left a strong impression on the audience of his time, and with good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with a mesmerizing setup that turns into a harrowing mystery full of excitement. The finale and the conclusion are above all "nightmare". It is a real advantage for your seat shocker. Even more impressive is the elegant design of De Palma, which gives this film not only tension, but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to kill is also a very erotic film, but especially in a strange way. Pino Donaggio also gives the film a charming score. <br /> <br /> The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain makes a great turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the unfortunate housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a dedicated Street Walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as a probing son. Many criticize De Palma's films because they have Hitchcockian elements, and this film was no exception. However, similarities between the works of Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be regarded as good quality, since the film is referred to as a "rip off", which would be a fine thriller. Dressed to kill is a must for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
