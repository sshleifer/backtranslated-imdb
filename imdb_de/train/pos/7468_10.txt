As the one-line summary states, two films made such a statement to me when I left the theater. One was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where you sit deep in the theater and stop thinking about anyone nearby. Stop asking yourself what the end of the movie is going to be and let the movie go where it pleases ... getting out of the cinema was a bit weird, like that feeling when you're sick and you can not think of anything leaves. One of those movies in which you become one with the guy and feel that nothing is moving around you than the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure. The actors are great, the soundtrack is excellent and everything in the movie is 9+. Surely one of the best movies I have ever seen, and the film that caused the best and most shocking sensation my life and purpose in this world.
