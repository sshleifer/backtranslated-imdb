This cartoon was strange, but the story had a bit more depth and feel than other cartoons. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and few other friends except a brother and a sister who are as miserable as she is. It reaches the ultimate low point, and when the opportunity arises, it literally makes a pact with a demoniac demon. I found this movie very life-like and just as things could not be worse, the girl sees what she's done, she feels excused and then changes and then she helps that dark, mystical creature to experience the human quality of love , The twins also improve by helping the little bear, and then they also get self-esteem. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were strange, this film was and is quite enjoyable. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie Songs) made the movie even better
