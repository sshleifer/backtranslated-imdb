This movie just shows that you do not need big explosions, billions of dollar computer graphics or heavily overpaid actors and actresses to make a good movie. the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa, excels. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves an epic piece. and for those who like Kurosawa's earlier works. 10/10
