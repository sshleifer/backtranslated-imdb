Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me a few weeks ago by a fried. I have never seen or even noticed because it (so typically) falls into the "Swedish Movie" category, and those who (like myself) got up with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of all foreign films. What a paradigm shift! The film touches me because it just keeps my hope that humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a model for all regions of the world where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, despondency, predictions, veiled brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... Triggers from the outside to tear down the masks of each (the one retains) and make them feel that we are all just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing such stories because that keeps my hope up as described above. The five minutes of the story of Gabriella's song including her performance are one of my movie highlights! Thank you, Kay Pollak, just for those 5 minutes that made me happy!
