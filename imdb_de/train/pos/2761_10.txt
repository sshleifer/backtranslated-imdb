I saw this movie for the first time in August 1996 on the way from Paris to Newark aboard Air France. The movie itself is in my opinion a true masterpiece. It's the kind of movie people should do. I still believe that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life to a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down syndrome patients. The actors, including the actor who actually has the Down syndrome, create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and life is forever changing with the Down syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play, but life and love and that's what life should be about. The end is kinda silly, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring you a tear.
