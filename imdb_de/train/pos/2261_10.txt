I've seen this movie and the play, and I must add that this was the most touching story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I did not know how horrible life was and probably still for the South African children and adults who lived and lived during that time. It brought tears to my eyes and a lot of sadness in my heart that every human being would have to fight just to stay alive and bring the children directly out of this area and teach them to act and to pretend and tell them Your own story is just incredible. These simply outperform a five-star rating, I rate it as ten. Thank you, Mr Mbongeni Ngema, for this amazing story. Although this story passed 12 years ago, it is still in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD in the game, please notify me as soon as possible. Many Thanks. PS There was nothing wrong with the children wanting to alert other countries to their problems and conditions in the hope that someone would have a heart and help.
