This was pretty good for a movie that got little publicity and few people heard about it. It's another of these modern British crime films that are peculiar ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast," etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch", but it's interesting and has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a cheesy and somewhat predictable ending, but at the beginning of the show - not late - it has some nice twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, this is a restrained British man who sends a Russian "mailorder bride", who becomes friends with the help of two Russian men and some great surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are the main characters, and they are very good, as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of movie and well implemented. Kidman proves once again that she is much more than just a beautiful face.
