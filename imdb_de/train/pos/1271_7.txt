We've never seen this movie based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and considering the top-notch cast that was put together for production, we decided to take a look. Although "Just Cause," though not a horrible movie, takes too much liberty with the original material, Jeb Stuart was not quite successful in his treatment. Arne Glimcher headed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a young black man is taken to the local area for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy when they beat Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We are appalled by what the officers do with the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother, is sent north to ask for a respected Harvard professor, a retired lawyer. The young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She is convinced that Armstrong can look at the case. He is also convinced of the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought. As Blair Sullivan, a man who works in the same facility as Bobby Earl, tells how he relates to the murder of the young girl and changes the dynamics of the case. As it plays in the movie, it confuses the viewer and distracts Armstrong from coming to the truth. This thriller is made entertaining by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as a sheriff who, as far as we can see, has mistreated his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson can be seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The movie will not disappoint despite its mistakes.
