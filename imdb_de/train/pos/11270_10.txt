Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the greatest Jane of all time, and there will never be a beautiful one. It is visually stunning. Besides, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. It has not only the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feeling of the ongoing saga. We are engaged in the two white hunters who are looking for ivory, one of them is in love with Jane, the other is a mischievous catalyst, whose character can be one of the most defined and best studied film history. Great action film is a classic. There is the unpleasant racism that is portrayed. The Africans, however, are portrayed as individuals, and in the end, two become even more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, the unnamed may evoke more sympathy from the audience than any other character. The finale is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The Great Lion Attack has never been repeated, and the horror is well associated with character responses, more than would be the case in a modern gore movie with a graphic depiction. If I missed something, it's because I do not want to pollute the image for those who have not seen it. But it's all you can ask for in a movie.
