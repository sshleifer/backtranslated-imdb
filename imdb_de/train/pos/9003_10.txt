<br /> <br /> I suppose this is not the best movie ever made, but I rated it 10 stars anyway. Mainly because of my feelings in the end. I and all the people around me were just touched. This is something you do not feel often. We are all a bit cynical and fed up with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the film revolves around Jane, a young woman in the final phase of MND, and the friendship that develops between her and Richard, a man about to collapse. This could easily have been a boring and worthy piece, but it is so humorous, humane and devoid of sentimentality that it completely convinces you and is a good movie against the odds. <br /> <br /> The acting of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is outstanding, especially the latter, who is always believable and strong in his role. The chemistry between the two also highlights the movie. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richard's masterpiece, a garbage plane and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol of Richards and Janes, who enjoy life to the full so that one can go on and the other can come to an end. <br /> <br /> A nice and funny movie that I can recommend to everyone. Do not be put off by the topic.
