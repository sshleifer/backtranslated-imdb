I just managed to get the Celestial Region 3 DVD from The Five Venoms and what a great job they made of it. A fantastic digitally remastered broadcast and a must for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty straightforward and has already been mentioned, so I will not go into it. Needless to say, those are the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a few and too overpriced. Bruce Lee could accept this lot while drinking a cup of tea! All kicks and punks come with the most important "typewriter" clicks and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect, though it's quite amusing. Good but not great In a way, it could be a little better. Golden Swallow, a decade earlier by the same director, had an equally good story and better action.
