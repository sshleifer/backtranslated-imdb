All the people who review this movie, and probably many professional movie critics, just do not understand it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques, much like the works of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get one of Zeman's films like "The Fabulous World of Jules Verne," "Baron Munchausen," "Journey to the Beginning," or "On the Comet." If you can not find a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They explain the processes used. If you look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to one of the other science-fiction fantasy films of the time, the audience probably would not have got it. It is unfair to compare the styles of these filmmakers to today's standard technologies, as both Zemen and Hines "do not expect". They have a unique style and should only be judged by their creativity. If you look at this film from a perspective where you know it's deliberately trying to make a pastiche collage of mats mixed with live action, you might easily come to the conclusion that it has done a masterful job. It's not easy to make a series of computer cutouts work. I also found the creatures pretty good, considering how they were made. Hines had a lot of gambling, and I think his movie will not be judged fairly for many years. Someone who advertised the film should have let the audience know what they were seeing rather than blindly going to the theater and expecting the usual CG work. In terms of the actors, I think, Hines also took over a page from Zemens book in which many of the actors of Zeman were initially somewhat blank, but in the course of the film and the action were always captivating. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I'll watch it for years, all three great hours.
