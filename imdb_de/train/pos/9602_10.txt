Darius Goes West is a film that shows the American faith that anything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful, fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film features a young man who never expected but wanted to see what was beyond the borders of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to fulfill Darius' wish. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an e-mail campaign to raise awareness of Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise money for the boys so that Darius can not only see the ocean, but also this great United States. To say that the young college buddies have managed to bring hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They recognized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold, show Darius love, caring and lots of fun, and help Darius see how he can show those characteristics to other people who suffer from DMD. Darius then volunteered for the Red Cross. He was sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) in front of a grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the boys an Oscar - otherwise nobody deserves it anymore. Martha Sweeney
