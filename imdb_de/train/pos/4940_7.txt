This movie is about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with meaningful text. It seems that Morgan Freeman is certainly having fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really like it when she plays. Women like them are a good motivation to learn Spanish. From the moment that Morgan Freeman meets cute Paz Vega, the gaze is thrown on an intimate journey in which two strangers learn to care for their way of life. 10 items or less is about joie de vivre. If you like this movie, you will also see The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. This is not an action movie or a nude comedy. It's about human relationships.
