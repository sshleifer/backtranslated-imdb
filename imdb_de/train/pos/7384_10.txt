Whoopi was the only reason why I saw the Oscars this year. She is funny. Of course, the show was very important. She was great, not only because she's funny, but also because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. Whites need to be reminded that the ceremonies, employment and representation of Hollywood prizes are racially inconsistent. There should be no need for "black" awards shows. The white bread, Milquetoast nominees and judges have to put their heads in the sun and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors and so on. He had no business with him. The fact is that this is the first Oscar presentation I've seen since "The Color Purple" was awarded for prizes. This miscarriage of voting has infuriated me while watching the shows until 2002. This is not meant to vilify other presenters. Billy Crystal is a rebellion.
