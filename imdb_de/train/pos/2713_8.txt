Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by the cops and imprisoned in this sparkling and amusing example of the exploitation of the 70s. This is the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing some of the New World movies from mentor Roger Corman and produced Demme was given the opportunity to bring directing for the first time, and he delivers a film that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but also appealing is winking quality too; It's often as funny as it is conspicuous. <br /> <br /> One of the outstanding scenes a naughty and coarse vaudeville act for the prisoners as well as a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for the upright and obviously very oppressed Superintendent McQueen include (horror icon Barbara Steele, the antagonistic in this Role performs a wonderful turn). I have also enjoyed a bank robber scene that was messed up, and a carjacking scene that was just rebellious. As in other films of this type, it is also commendable that this is both a portrait of female empowerment and pure exploitation. These women are tough, they do not take anyone's rubbish and they are more than capable of dealing with themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive occupation here makes the most of her roles: Juanita Brown as aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as a newcomer and Lynda Gold (also called Crystin Sinclaire ), who presents himself as an outsider as an accomplice. <br /> <br /> As our climax comes to an end, Demme waits with a tense "beat the clock" goal, while our heroines save from Belle to escape from the predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), a kind of man who does not do anything to exploit women, to be rescued <br /> <br /> "Caged Heat" is an exciting conversation and a guaranteed good time
