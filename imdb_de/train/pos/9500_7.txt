I saw this movie on TV and was fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a decent movie and you can see it for the beauty of Africa and of course for Mccomb. At that time I was thrilled to watch this movie, and from then on I try for VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. Huge African lions emerge in his film and we will be limited by the size of these animals and the grace of these animals. All sections of the audience can see this movie, especially kids will enjoy this movie. Some scenes in which Mccomb is involved force parental guidance for this movie. It is a pleasant holiday movie for everyone.
