Like many series pilots, Dark Angels Opener shows a mix of great potential and a slight problem finding one's own feet. Not that it's unusual in any way, but it feels like it could have worked better if the story were a little firmer and more focused. In today's world, where something needs to happen immediately or is in danger of being annulled, the series has proven a bit bitter by not being at least halfway focused and all guns on fire. <br /> <br /> The 90-minute pilot really feels like two episodes stuck together, and both episodes have a focus issue. In the first half we are introduced to Max and learn what drives them. We also have some interesting routines in which Max uses her skills to win bets, interact with a PI, or sort out her colleagues' domestic issues. The problem here is that this is not unusual for a person with a normal set of genes, on television, or otherwise. <br /> <br /> When we reach the second half, we get a story with purpose and focus. In the two halves, Max is at the center of a pirate journalist who wants to find it a life task to save the world by exposing a dirty dealer. In the second half, the consequences catch up with him and Max reluctantly releases the resulting chaos. This sets the premise for the rest of the series and works, but it does not quite click when they get my meaning. It's like most of the pieces are there, but a pair that makes a complete picture has been left out. Maybe they'll be filled up with later episodes, but that does not matter. The fact is that the content of this episode could have been told less easily at 28 minutes. <br /> <br /> The last negative is that many of the support cast are completely unappetizing. Original Cindy in particular is a nuisance, and I doubt that has changed in the next twenty episodes. The drama is not as bad as soap during the day, but of such good quality I would not recommend it. Although Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, she does not believe when the story needs it the least. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and production values ​​are all first class, top notch. In fact, this series was considered quite expensive to produce, and it is rather unfortunate that it was canceled to be replaced by another show that did not last a full season. Especially if both shows had enough time - they could have simply canceled one of the awkward trash cans that they whipped under the banner of reality TV. The fact is, we need more shows like Dark Angel, where attention is more likely to be generated by fantasy than by overhype. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've given the Dark Angel pilot seven points out of ten. It never rises above the level of disposable televisions and never got the chance to reach the potential it shows in its own lifetime. But the potential is there, and that's often all about pilots.
