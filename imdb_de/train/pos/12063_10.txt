The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's modern ghost story, released only a few years earlier when the movie was filmed. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD. As far as I know, he was deleted on VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to its popularity among the horror movie connoisseurs. The story revolves around events in a coastal community at the beginning of the 20th century, when a young lawyer was sent by his law firm to complete the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated wetland. What he considered a routine and probably boring task becomes a nightmare when he finds out that the old woman was persecuted until her death and the ghosts of her past do not rest. The story is narrated in a subtle yet concise manner and is never selfish, conspicuous or exaggerated. The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but it's exactly what the story needs and why it works so well. It's what you do not see that scares you. However, there is a particularly frightening scene that relies on the visual and works perfectly. I saw this movie during the day and almost a week later I still had nightmares. If you love being scared, do what you need to do to see a copy of The Woman In Black.
