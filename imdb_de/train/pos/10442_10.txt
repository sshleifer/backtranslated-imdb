This is really one of the best love movies I have ever seen. Exactly followed by "Before Sunset", which is technically not a movie at all, because it is the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, that's only the case when most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the main characters in the movie. When I read the other reviews, I'm glad to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based films. And that's what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's no surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love because they fall in love with her at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the caf√©, where they pretend to be calling their best friends, the other pretending to be their best friend. It's perfect. Bring you back to the moment you first fell in love with your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say, if you have a choice, look at "Before Sunrise" before you look at "Before Sunset." If you've seen "Sunset" like me, it's hard to To shake off the feeling of compassion and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Once again the biggest romantic film in my books, wonderful drama, excellent screenplays and beautiful places, young love, best of all.
