This movie contains the one ingredient that all revenge films should have, and that is true emotion. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions in this movie. This movie is captivating from start to finish. The plot on paper sounds like the usual garbage that is usually thrown into the faces of the audience, but do not be fooled, this movie is powerful. Washington, as always, does a great job. <br /> <br /> The plot in brief: The man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life to him, children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. Does not sound like anything special, but it's way better than any other similar movie. For a moment TAKEN is a similar movie, but if you compare both, MAN ON FIRE will undoubtedly win. The characters are captivating and everyone brings a great performance and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is presented brilliantly. The style of the direction was something I enjoyed and made the most of Mexico City. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you bring out once a year to watch again, or a movie you wish to see family and friends. From beginning to end you root for the main protagonist and make him a roller coaster ride. There's enough action to make you happy, there's enough character development to please you, and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face. Look at this movie, you will not be disappointed
