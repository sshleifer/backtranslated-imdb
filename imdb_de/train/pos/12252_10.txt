I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen her many times and am always looking forward to seeing her again. Although it lasts only 107 minutes, most of the new acts and negotiations were developed satisfactorily. All characters are well represented. Most of the dialogues come straight from the novel, with no stupid jokes like Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The scenery and costumes were beautiful. I find this version fairly similar to the 1995 miniseries Pride and Prejudice, but the producer and scriptwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job portraying "Emma," of whom Jane Austen said she would make heroin that she did not love. She is snobbish, but has just enough youth and inexperience to be sympathetic. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr. Knightley, not an easy part, I think, though he does not have the charisma shown by Colin Firth's Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene (Harvest Festival), which does not take place in the novel, is a fitting ending, except when Emma is cold and almost uncomfortable with Frank Churchill, while in the novel she thoroughly reconciled with him and even told him that she was enjoyed the duplicity if she had been in his situation. A strange departure from the fidelity that was otherwise shown in the film. I find the costumes more beautiful and sophisticated than other edits from Jane Austen's novels.
