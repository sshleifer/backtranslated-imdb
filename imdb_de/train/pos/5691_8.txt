I was very interested in seeing this movie when it first appeared in the movie theaters. I could not come to that. Finally it hit the shelves and I picked it up. Not sure what to expect, I put the DVD in the player, decided on a murder evening and pressed play. What followed was one of the more engaging films I've seen in the last few years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Wonderland murders that led to John Holmes (Val Kilmer), most of LA and straight to the biggest porn Start of the 70s. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled from the beginning and the feeling of the film kept me all the way to the very bloody end. I was surprised to learn that the film focused less on the actual murders than on the events before and the investigation afterwards. Apart from a few blood-splashed walls at the beginning and the actual demonstrations of the murders towards the end, the film was more or less an engaging show of great dialogues and great acting. Val Kilmer almost sells me as a junkie pornstar, and even the "nice, but that's it" Bosworth was a pleasure to see (and just for her looks, mind you). <br /> <br /> Personally, I felt best One aspect of the film, as I mentioned earlier, was the lack of homicides. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not fully see the brutal club that was awarded to a sleeping four. In addition, the sound effects of the killings were more than enough to whet my appetite. They had beaten with lead pipes, there is not much else to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was Carrie Fischer's short appearance. Her portrayal of the exaggerated religious figure was, in my opinion, a little too clich√©d. Maybe this person was part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason Fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayal. All in all an excellent movie worth the clock, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
