Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before I saw the movie, I might not be as excited about it as I am. Despite all fairness, I would probably still like the movie production better, because I can admire both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, though he is also quite an actor), see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here To Eternity. ) <br /> <br /> As for the other reviewers' comments on the songs, so does the Broadway soundtrack, and although Isabel Bingley's voice surpasses that of Jean Simmons, it's no more enjoyable. I think it's pretty shrill. Jean Simmons's voice is much more realistic, though admittedly this is not always a big concern in musicals. The only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak voice register was during his rendition of "Luck Be A Lady" and only there because I was familiar with Sinatra's version. I think Vivian Blaine's voice in the movie is a lot more enjoyable than on Broadway. And only Sinatra's voice would be able to correct the mistakes of others if they really needed salvation. (Were not) It's infinitely better than Sam Levene's, especially in my favorite song "Sue Me". <br /> <br /> I can also distinguish the complaint that many songs were left out of the film because of inferior songs. "A Bushel and A Peck" is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, "Pet Me Poppa", and the accompanying performance is more hot-box material. Personally, I do not care about "Marry the Man Today" and I'm glad about it. It was not included in the movie, I love it "I've never been in love", and although it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version is heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song "A Woman In Love" expresses the same feeling as well and probably in an area that both stars could better reach, and the movie would not be the same without the song "Adelaide", which is not included on Broadway movie soundtrack was available for sale, I would recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that acting would be superior to the lead role of the movie actor. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and the son of gs do not make it any less.
