OK Clara Bow silent movie from 1927, it is a spin-off from Rain, with Bow he plays the half Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king, who falls in love with the burly English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women are surprised when his wife (Patricia Dupont) shows up. The predatory woman is ready for a divorce until she finds out that he may be close to a fortune. Bow settles quickly with the hash. Bow has personality he has to afford and he has some great scenes: opening act bath, hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene where Bow and Brook do their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is incorrect. In the movie credits (from the DVD I have) it is stated that Patricia Dupont plays Mrs. Haldane - not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb.
