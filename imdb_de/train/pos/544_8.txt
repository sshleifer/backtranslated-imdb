I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin on the lake), only instead of killing women, he also killed men. And the scenes are much more interesting, two of my favorite scenes are, first, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he describes the last moments of Kimberly before being thrown into the water, and second, when Stanley visits Allison's basement in his cinema, in short before they go to the set when she kisses him. These scenes were very intense and fascinating for me. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad. I mean, there were times when you noticed that there was nothing wrong with it, as if it were filmed like a film would normally be shot, you would not see the "live" camera, but then you would not make very much the mistakes when filming. what went wrong??
