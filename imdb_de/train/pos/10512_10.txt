First, I bought this movie on VHS when I only had to buy it on DVD, it's one of my favorite movies ever. I read the book, but I really think the movie is a lot better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley an excellent choice. He was great! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
