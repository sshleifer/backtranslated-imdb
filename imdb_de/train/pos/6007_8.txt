If you have not heard of this movie from Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry. It would be classed together with other Disney-related films intended for educational purposes, such as Family Planning. <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach mainly girls about menstruation. It only forms on a superficial level, so it does not go into too much detail for the animated sequence "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System. The film features "The Wonderful World of Disney" elements such as page turning and animations to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find. So if you can find the movie, we wish you good luck and a lot of fun.
