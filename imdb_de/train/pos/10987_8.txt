Having gone through the local video store's sci-fi weeklies, I lost hope to find good movies that I had not seen before. Renting Cypher was like a barge on a possibly very lame horse. My son is so shaken by the current "B" science fiction that he has not bothered to see it. <br /> <br /> It must be noted that I did not see anything of Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, that was a really pleasant surprise! This is not a B-movie either. It's not a blockbuster of epic diversity and does not try it - more of a quiet movie that has to be seen several times to make the most of it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful Being presented when used - my only complaint is that the superhelo is a leetle, obviously at first glance CGI, but they got it right on the second gig, and Apart from that, everything else is first class. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything about the plot. The plot structure has a Russian doll aspect that is a bit reminiscent of Basic Instinct (but with very different content). <br /> <br /> I just want to say that the decision to star Jeremy Northam was a masterpiece. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent on the film acts as a kind of extremely enforced New England dialect. See the final twist of the storyline and you'll see why this is such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is just right for her: "Will she kiss me - will she shoot me"? Edge. <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies in a matter of days - this is one of them.
