The dinner party could be, in my opinion, the biggest adult movie production of all time. It is produced so exquisitely and the actors show their roles outstanding. The kitchen scene with Yvonne and Juli Ashton is great. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. Besides, the doctor's office scene is well done. The campfire scene is full of fun action, though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is unbelievable, but who would expect anything else from her. The final scene is somewhat overused in adult films, but is still classic. I would highly recommend this movie to fans of adult movies and these casual audiences. Come to your video library and pick it up today.
