What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teen. Take a handkerchief, it is not sad, it only moves in parts. After all, it is a "feel good movie" for the whole family. Note: It is more than two hours. So remember to leave the smallest house of winds for this house. AP
