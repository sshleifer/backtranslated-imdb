Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades, his western looks like Real McCoy, captivating, entertaining and spectacular. by no means outdated. <br /> <br /> As a true fan of TV's DEADWOOD, I tell you that Gary Cooper is much more targeted as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane /> <br /> We have no more giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the decade 1936-1945 that have passed a decade of commercial life for decades: published, reissued and re-released. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's films are being searched in 7 months or 70 years.
