Henry Fool is a better movie. However, this is the perfect way to watch a movie like Henry Fool. To take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the first shot of "Henry Fool" as Simon lays his ear to the ground as Henry walks over the hill becomes even more apparent with "Fay Grim". The over-the-top jokes that are more or less meta-jokes (about writing the film and the jokes themselves) are good, but the opening of the movie is a bit saturated. Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is staggering, yes, it's intentional, but it feels compelled and overwhelmed, it's beyond screaming, which I'd call annoying. It's a flawed movie, but a must-have for any Hartley or 'Henry Fool' fan. <br /> <br /> And do not stop silly reviews, do not look at this, unless you saw the first movie. The intrigue, satire, and joke of this movie are completely lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. That's just stupid.
