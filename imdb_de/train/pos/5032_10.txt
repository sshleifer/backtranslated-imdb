The movie "Frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It's all like a horror movie, but that's not it. "Frailty" is a film about the perception of religion and the recognition of the differences between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In "Frailty," a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to do this work of God. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers known as "God's Hands." We watch as the father brutally kills the "demons" while convincing his sons and themselves that they are doing the work of God and that what they are doing is right. He claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on Earth. God has given him a list of names and in return for his "ministries"; He and his sons are protected, which means the police can never capture them. We see it all very disturbing in front of us. But what is really disturbing is the effect it has on the two sons, especially the eldest son Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being until his father and a week in the basement change all that. He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure that his younger brother Fenton is the same. Fenton, the other half of the puzzle, picks up everything as if it were his own religion. He seems to be trapped in God's world of his father and demons. I suppose that's because he's so young and easy to impress. But everything that happens with these three is in fact too convincing, too convincing. <br /> <br /> The events of the film can be considered a living hallucination experienced by the three main characters. I say that because they all react differently to the situation and at one point in the movie they claim to see God. The father sees the murders first as his mission. His "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with demons. In fact, his hallucination is the primary one. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are all part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to find out where I'm from. Fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all the talk of demons and destruction. Being so young, he easily falls into the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical of the actions of his father. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a way, when Papa is killed near the end of the movie, the hallucination ends. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death, it is fast until today. (The story is told through flashbacks, seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, Fenton tells the story, not Adam, as originally thought. The story is told as he has perceived it, through his actions and the actions of his brother. Fenton went insane and continues what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is a major theme in this film, the film also shows how easy religion is to be misunderstood by those who have not fully understood it. Before Dad discovered his newly discovered mission, he himself had neither a clear understanding of religion, nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent hymns for young children, but probably had no clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. After the revelation of Dad's newly discovered mission, they both started in separate directions - Adam did not doubt that it was an outstanding being as Fenton was gradually drawn into his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that makes you lose courage, do not look alone.
