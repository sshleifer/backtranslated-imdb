I saw this movie some time ago, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself was very interesting, although it had positive aspects, what kind of "wtf?" By Donnie Darko was. Factor after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are also negative ones with positive ones. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good and Dominic Monaghan has also done a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. That could only be me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic, as I do not think fit, but he did not seem convincing as an actor. But maybe it's even more noticeable, because even though I'm not a critic, that gets my attention. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say it's definitely worth a movie to watch. It's interesting, confusing and you should have just seen it.
