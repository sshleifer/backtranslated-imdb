Me and my sister hired this movie because we were in the mood to see something trashy and not so demanding. However, the film has far exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It's so much more than a representation of a century. There are very real depictions of the characters and most actors do amazing work. The different stories are baked together with current footage from the time, which gives it a very unique touch. When I looked at it I really had the feeling that I was interested in what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also praise Julia Stiles for her portrayal of Katie, she was great in a way! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone.
