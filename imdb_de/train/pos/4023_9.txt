This is an extremely well made movie. Acting, script and camera work are first class. The music is good too, although it's usually early in the movie when things are still relatively happy. There are no really superstars in the cast, though some faces will be known. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see because a situation like the one presented does not have a good ending. It is now fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims against each other and then cruelly separating them into two countries. This perspective has some advantages, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to abuse each other as they did at the time of division. It is more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were smart enough to exploit them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and that is very uncomfortable to remember and to see on the screen. However, it is never painted as a black and white case. On both sides there is lowliness and nobility, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a kind of salvation when Puro has to make a hard decision between a man who ruined her life, but also really loved her, and her family, which she has broken, comes later looking for her. At this point, however, she has no other option without much pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film has the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave mistakes and that both can be dignified and caring. The reality of division makes this realization all the more difficult as there can never be true reconciliation across the border between India and Pakistan. In this sense it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we were happy to see the movie, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States were able to respond to their own history of racism with this kind of openness, that would certainly be better.
