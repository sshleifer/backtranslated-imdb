I saw the movie when I recovered from a major surgery. I knew it was just a "B" movie, a Western room, but I loved it. Maybe there was a lack of flashes of high dollar productions that still held my imagination and made for a great escapism. Unfortunately, our society has so much available to suppress small attempts is too simple. Just as I myself can enjoy a school performance by Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the arts. I am a police officer and have found an affinity to the retired LAPD. Dreams like him haunt me, that at the moment of the crisis I will not be able to react to it, to save the life of another (or my own). While it was a romantic ending when Farnsworth unleashed the evil (predictably), I needed a little happy romance in which good can prevail. My world is really too cynical.
