I saw this movie in spring 2004 at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and inventive shocker, is one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This Terrorizer has a great selection of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gestures like Italian horror movies in the eighties. Meat broke to the bone ... and the blood is red ... this wild heart stopper will grab you ... and give you dark dreams ... A must!
