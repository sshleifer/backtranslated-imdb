This unsung, quiet gem tells the true story of an escape during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is awesome and sounds very true. In fact, an unusual all-round authenticity puts this one head above most war poses.
