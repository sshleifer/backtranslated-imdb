CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad for it in a video. Then my sister discovered that we had the book, so I read it. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable, as was the book. The cast was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent, as Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful as Arthur. The costumes, the music and the settings are breathtakingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE <br /> <br /> On the bottom there are some sex scenes that were added, and some violence. That's why the video was rated 15. There are a few other things that have been thrown in. After the first part, I had the feeling that the accuracy was downhill. The book is better than this, but I am glad that I have seen it and would recommend it to people who have read the book, Bronte fans or costume drama (I'm all 3!) As long as you are by gender go scenes. The book is rather undervalued. Anne Bronte's books do not seem to be as widely read or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, which have made several television and film appearances. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised how much religion it contained, but here they had stopped it all! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
