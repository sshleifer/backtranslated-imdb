This movie sat on my Tivo for weeks before I saw it. I was afraid of a self-indulgent yuppie movie about bad relationships. I was wrong; This was a captivating trip to the kinky Libidos of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as that of Max Ophul's "La Ronde," based on a piece by Arthur Schnitzler, the one "inspired by credit." It's about a person, a prostitute, She's being picked up by a contractor who has sex on the bonnet with her, but can not come in. He refuses to pay her, so if she does not want to pee, she'll go on his cell phone and She takes a message, she runs away with the keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story changes to the contractor who professionally calls a rich, bored New York woman to play with him until he's upset, and then she pulls away, she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is, he tells her how beautiful she is and happiness, when she leaves she asks if he has sex with her, she sits on him and jumps up and This time he comes, who goes. <br /> <br /> The wife and her husband verans create a dinner party for their trendy friends. Hubby (Robert) does business, Mrs. (Ellen) gets bored and changes the subject to sex and how often men and women think about it. Husband switches the conversation to the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen attempts to seduce Robert into sex. Robert does not want any of that and puts on a jazz record. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert turns on the music; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. It follows the cacophony. Ellen goes to the roof, Robert comes to her. Ellen admits that she has to experience more men than Robert. Robert says he also needs to know men. <br /> <br /> We follow Robert when he visits an artist, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I wish Buscemi could have more roles like this, where he is a sexy, smart and absolutely desirable guy. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than it deserves, promises to put it on a show. Martin is excited until it turns out that Robert speaks from his groin area, it's all a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin's lips and Martin pulls back and says he's not gay. Robert claims that he is not gay either, mocks Martin. Both admit that the artworks are bad. Robert is about to leave when Martin allows Robert to kiss him. You turn off and Robert settles on Martin. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Martin as he prepares for an art exhibit in a gallery in Manhattan. He is delighted with the receptionist Anna, who is played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut some of this criticism to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they love each other. <br /> <br /> We follow Anna, who is sitting at a lunch table. Her friend Nick (Adrian Grenier) comes in and wears flowers. She is cold to him; he tries to find out why. He elicits from her the information that she had sex with someone when he was in San Francisco. She elicits him the fact that during his stay in San Francisco he stayed with his ex-girlfriend and had sex with her. The latter revelation turns out to be a lie. The two go out in the luncheonette, but they decide that they must part. Nick is heartbroken. <br /> <br /> We follow Nick, who admits his problems to an elderly woman whom he meets on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is kind of weird and childish, but he's a good audience for Nick, who needs an open ear. The two go to Coney Island at night and look at the stars. Nick falls under the spell of Joey, despite the age difference between them. They go back to Joey's apartment, and Nick gradually realizes he's having sex with a crazy old woman. She is on him, does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (By the way, this is Carol Kane's best role since she played Latke's wife in Taxi.) Joey's phone is ringing, and there is a man calling the Psychic Friends Network, and Joey is one of the mental friends. Although she is still hurt by Nick, she is gradually getting psycho-shocked. The man is in his office late at night and wants to talk to her. Although that's not Joey's thing, Joey goes along, forcing the man to come along. She wants to continue talking, although the man wants to leave the phone and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company and will find out tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide and tries to convince him that she is his girlfriend and takes care of him. And she cares about him. <br /> <br /> But the man grabs a gun in his briefcase and sets out to look for a prostitute on the Brooklyn Waterfront, and we return to the beginning, to the same prostitute who started La Ronde. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she kills him. He tried to kill himself but could not. The prostitute does not want it, but she insists that she holds her hand, holds the gun in her mouth, and tells her where to aim. Finally the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and arriving at the corner where she normally does business. The contractor, who did not pay her earlier in the movie, drives up and rolls down the window. They look at each other. THE END.
