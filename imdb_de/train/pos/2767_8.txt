Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or so) are great and Peck is absolutely delighted to see them. The same can not be said for the rest of the movie. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I should be honest) to see is Peck. For the rest it is better to read the Old Testament.
