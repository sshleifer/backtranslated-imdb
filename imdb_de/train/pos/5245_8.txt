I found this movie funny. It's fun not to be taken seriously, a movie about the twisted views of a man about life, love and ... well, ladies "from the low bus stop to the high-class debutant ... the bus stop." Tim Wiesen plays a man (Leon Phelps), who grew up in a Playboy-style mansion by a Hugh Hefner-erquire father figure, who is constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" steps on the street, he has to learn not to fight back with anything but the chauvinist way of life that his youth taught him. And so begins the Hijinx! If you have not seen this movie before and enjoy a light-hearted, semi-mindless comedy / love story, I strongly suggest you hire 'The Ladies' Man'.
