I love the way this game literally makes you jump out of your seat while you play it. The way the screen bounces and blinks when hit is very realistic, while at the same time you have to remember that it's just a game and you're not really there. The sound effects and the audio are amazing. There are many weapons and spells, and you can even choose which spells should be stronger or not. You will receive this stone that can repel enemies as you gain mana to defeat your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that you are really nervous throughout the season and are worried about what might lurk around the next corner or what might pop out behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try headphones.
