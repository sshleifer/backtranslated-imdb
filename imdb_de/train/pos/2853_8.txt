I finally saw this movie tonight after renting it to Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. We're being treated to the director's eye, his vision of what history is about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want it. I think Sabu must have influenced the directors of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I loved how the three see the beautiful woman in the street, to distract her for a moment. I have to see the other work of this director, because this film really fascinates me. If you want insight, culture, storm and urge, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movements and criminal glee, look here.
