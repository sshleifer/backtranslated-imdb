I remember seeing this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never saw him after that. I was babysitting the other day and my cousin never saw All Dogs in the sky, so we both hired movies and saw them together today, and he really loved those movies. So many memories came back when I saw this movie again and I have to admit that I even cried a bit. I am 22 years old and the end is still coming to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most touching animated films and I am genuinely shocked by this rating of 5.8. I thought this movie would bring good memories to others as well. I admit, the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just charming and funny. Charlie is a playing dog killed by another playing dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he comes down to earth with a clock that can not stop ticking, or that's the end of his life. When he and his best friend Itchy look for Carface and spy on him, they learn how Carface gets all his money. He has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl Ann-Marie and makes false promises to get the money. But in the end, he learns that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie first before himself, when Carface returns to him with all his might. All dogs go to heaven is the perfect family movie, not Disney, but this is a great family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's just so cute and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie made me as a kid believe that dogs have souls. How could you not? You're just so sweet and I think I'll cry again. But in any case, I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a funny movie that you can watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
