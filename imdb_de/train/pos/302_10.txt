This movie is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" strikes close at home, is nice to look at and has so much fun playing. Ben Gazzara was an outstanding cast and easily in love. I'm sure I met Arthur somewhere on my travels. An excellent choice for every evening! :-)
