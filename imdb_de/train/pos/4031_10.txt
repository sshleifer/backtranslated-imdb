I've been a Hindi movie fan since the age of 4, but never in my life have I seen such a moving and impressive movie, especially as a Hindi movie. In recent years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and returned to the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only moving, but also very instructive for someone who is a first-generation Indian-born Indian woman. It helped me to understand my own family history, which was always very abstract to me. But to "see," feel, and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that the Indian people were living through. The film has helped me put many things in perspective, especially given the current world events. I never thought that a movie could change my way before he ... did it. The plot is fantastic, the acting excellent and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
