This takes about a year after the events in Basic Instinct. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while driving a car at 110 mph (not asking), she gets off the road and lands in the Thames. She survives - he does not. The police commissioned psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if they have any spiritual powers to stand trial. Of course, she starts playing with his mind, and many murders and sex follow. <br /> <br /> This film was doomed to fail before it even opened. It took forever to get a cast and a director, screenplay problems were constant, and the cast was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). Still, it's not that bad. It's similar to the first - there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, lots of sex and nudity (this had to be changed for a R), a pretty intricate plot and good acting - but it does not matter. It feels like retreading the first one. People are killed here with a collar leash (I think) ... just as people were killed by an ice ax the first time. In a fun moment, Stone takes an ice pick and looks at him eagerly. She also plays mind games with a man and could involve him in murders. The similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> This is also VERY R-rated - There are plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks much nude than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great.)) and some bloody ones murders. The spectacle is good all along the line. Stone is just fantastic here. Morrissey looks miserable, but is fine; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Well - that's not bad at all, but feels like a remake of the first one. Nevertheless, I recommend it. People have just attacked that because Stone is not popular and she felt it was stupid to make a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was completed.
