The Unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie that takes advantage of the anxiety associated with pregnancy. It's played very well by the always good Brooke Adams and B-movie fighter James Karen, though the supporting cast is pretty average for a B-Grader. The music of Gary Numan is good too. The script of Henry Dominic is quite intelligent for this type of intelligence, though there is a hint of misogyny. Rodman Fender's direction is just adequate and there is unnecessary cheap fear. If you're a fan of Adams whose film career is not nearly as famous as it should be, you should try it. She is great as always.
