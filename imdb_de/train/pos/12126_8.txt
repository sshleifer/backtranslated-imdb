In this 1934 film, Bette Davis presents himself as Mildred Rogers. The movie seems to be quite outdated in 2003. Undoubtedly worth watching movie freaks and Bette Davis fans, but should be less attractive for the average film observer today. It was amazing for me to see what young Davis looks like in this movement. The actors turn to concepts that are basically solid, and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well staffed as Philip Carey, the club student. This is a movie with a strong message about who we love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" seemed to influence me neither mentally nor emotionally. After watching the movie, I felt a bit indifferent and distant. I have the intuition that this could be the reaction the director was aiming for. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
