A decent "race against time" - A murdered John Doe has a lung plague. While the health department and the NOPD are fighting each other for their waterfront contacts, the killers believe that the heat is due to the victim's infected cousin. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for free in the Internet Archive and is worth it. Many (all?) This movie was filmed in real New Orleans movies, which makes it interesting to look at what is now detailed, though it looks underexposed to me, even to Noir - maybe even to mobile lighting devices were not what they were are. There are also a lot of background sounds that distract something - car horns in the love scene. There are many non-professional support artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the tempo of the movie is a bit lank at first - not a big chance for repetition or recasting, though the final chase is a sequel. There is not much wrong with the main cast: Jack Palance, as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath, is really scary - the later scene, in which he alternately consoles and threatens the sick cousin, is terrible, while Widmark, as he often did, is the righteous one The man pulls himself on a credible mission - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should repeat this - no supernatural, no mysticism, no special effects, just a good yarn full of character conflicts and a current topic. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's just right for the number of odd New Orleans guys sucking on that dark, rundown drama against the clock. There is even a small newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
