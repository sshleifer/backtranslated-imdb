In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that I had to think about for a long time after thinking about it. It talks so about death, revenge and hell, that it comes like a slap in the face and even the dream sequence in the middle of the film must suffer. This makes the movie so good: Don Bluth's (director) unique ability to play with people's emotions and make them love or hate a character in no time. That and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie that you have to say in the sad but happy ending, "I have something in mind" to hide the others who have cried. Everything I said are just a few of the good points of this movie. By the way, you have to see them in a movie extremely honest. Don Bluth, thank you.
