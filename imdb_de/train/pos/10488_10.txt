Brenda Blethyn played after her Oscar-nominated turn in "Secrets & Lies" in the equally big "Saving Grace". And let me tell you, this is not the kind of movie you find everyday. <br /> <br /> After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that she has left a movie due to her irresponsible financial decisions. Fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. Yes, Grace starts to cultivate her. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie has been played with great effect. It's not a boring moment anywhere. And I certainly did not see this end scene coming! But you still have to watch this movie. You may feel more than a little festive after seeing it. Unless otherwise, it could be a good lesson on how to know your finances. But of course there is much more than that!
