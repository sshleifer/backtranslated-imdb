I saw this movie for the first time in midday film in 1980. After many more visits (and the purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a remnant of another age - a domestic comedy in affluent middle-class America - but executed well. It's also a document of its era - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom, and the burgeoning consumer age. This movie is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful, sophisticated leading actors - urban Melvyn Douglas; confused Cary Grant; The determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means we have to blast", "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> I love it.
