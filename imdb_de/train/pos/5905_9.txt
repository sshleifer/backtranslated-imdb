This is a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible movies and this is my favorite movie of her. This film should have won the National Award and would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than "Shaaws", which is coming to India from the Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian films) is missing from IMDb and sometimes it is even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important role in this film and is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and the crew are not mentioned. Prizes and nominations for this film will not be awarded, even though Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even a voice for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence. It is not tangled in dazzling glamor and semi-understood designer merchandise. It is a realistic, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi', which can be roughly translated as 'two women', is a story of the two sisters Gauri and Krishna. It's actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not dare to engage in much negotiation, and that makes it a very difficult movie. The entire film takes place in a wild, remote village in Maharashtra and the screen seldom ventures far away from the house of the two protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Since Gauri and Krishna's father are a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy. they do not lack their simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's husband gets into a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not stand the tragic news and suffers a severe stroke. Without a strong, working member, the house could have fallen apart, but Gauri's mother takes responsibility. She works as much as possible and can not make ends meet. But her life is still easier than Gauris. The superstition that people half-heartedly try to forget makes Gauri a bad luck charm. She was expelled from society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts his proposal. He brings Gauri to Mumbai, where she has to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns, and her conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family. <br /> <br /> When Gauri comes home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri, but fears for Krishna's life. This completely destroys Gauri and she decides to return to her unhappy life. But Krishna runs out and arrests Gauri. She asks her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promise that they would face the world? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not needed in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai, but what she does there is never told? The subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It is only the bare story that is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is responsible cinema. It is respectful of the topic that it treats. It is respectful to its audience? They do not believe that they have the mental capacity of a four-year-old. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is first class. The direction is wonderful? The silence carries the story forward in a way that could not have had words. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate good cinema, you like 'Doghi'.
