The photography was beautiful, but I had trouble understanding what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... the two goldfish - do they mean something in the Thai culture? There is not a lot of conspiracy, not much happens and it just snakes on. No real beginning, no real center and no real ending. actually rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to deal with the characters because they had never met them ... it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real. The movement felt chaotic and incoherent. I do not know what the Pang brothers wanted to achieve. If I were Thai, it might make more sense ...
