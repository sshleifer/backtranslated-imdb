Harman and Ising's 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of animation art. The distinctive skill and artistry that characterizes this duo work is nowhere clearer than in this caricature. It's a shame that so many people can only see insults in what a carefree entertainment object is and should always be, that in no way tried to scold black people. If anything, it's a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. I have not been able to view this sweetmeat for many years as the "race commissioners" in England have found it too offensive to be shown in multicultural Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would be very happy to revisit this masterpiece. I think that those who routinely search for messages and intentions that were never intended in these sixty-year-old cartoons should try to remember that the world today is a very different place, but that does not mean that everyone does Right to censor what is visible from the past.
