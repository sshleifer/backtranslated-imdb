As a horse lover you can only appreciate this movie. There are only a few films that show horsemanship. I would like to know if Brian does his own riding in the movie. I would also like to know if he likes horses. Brian has starred in many movies in which he rode. Where did he learn to ride? The only part I can barely take is that the driving scenes are always up to date, as a horse can run at full power forever. The camera work is first-rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous a horse can be. It would be very interesting to know how they occupied this film to find all the very good riders.
