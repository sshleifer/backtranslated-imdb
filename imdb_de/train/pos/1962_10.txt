What an exciting ride! Twisted and thought provoking. Once again, Sharon Stone perfectly honors her deadly, fascinating character, author Catherine Tramell. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel will take place in London, where Catherine has since moved. Both bustling cities are known for excitement, haute couture and a perfect location for someone like Catherine Trammel who can choose a residence. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr. Michael Glass. The character who plays David Thewlis as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension - all "basic instincts". Mind Bending throughout. Great script. This film is anything but boring, from the opening scene to the end of the surprise. Everyone in the theater was stuck to the screen.
