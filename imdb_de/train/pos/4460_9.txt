Ah, a Kelly / Sinatra sailor musical. So familiar, right? Yes, but you usually do not hear that. That's one way on the city. But if you stay, you could learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchor's Aweigh tells the story of two sailors who have taken three or four days off. Joe is the "Sea Wolf," and Clarence, the book lover, asks Joe to give him a "lady." After being picked up by the copper, they get the little Donald home. There they meet Susie, this seductress, this Jezebel. Was just a joke! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he believes it. Is he right Or is he an idiot? Or is he just misled by society? Find out and find out more when you {trompet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! If you want to see that Kathryn Grayson is anything but pathologically sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
