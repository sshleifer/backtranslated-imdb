Nice movie with a great soundtrack that stretches through the rock scene of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation that describes life in a small village near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), it describes the lives of young people and their problems with the World. It is reminiscent of Trainspotting with some Italian touch.
