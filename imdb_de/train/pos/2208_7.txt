Joanne Murray, a student who takes on the unpleasant task of making the dormitory into apartments. This includes the sale of unneeded furniture. This is done during a break, and a mysterious Psycho follows the almost empty space on campus. "Dormitory, which was dripped Blood" is a cheap slasher, which is quite entertaining. The acting is pretty bad, the plot is predictable, but the gore effects are pretty good. The film was made by the UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for next to nothing, it starts a dreamy atmosphere, very similar to the surrounding forests by Jeff bodies Mans fantastic "Just Before Dawn" 7 out of 10. It's great, Daphne Zuniga seen by "The Initiation", who gets run over by a car a couple of times.
