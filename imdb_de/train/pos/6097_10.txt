I do not understand how it can be said that Freddy's Nightmares is corny and a rip-off. Obviously you do not know good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series is shitty, you have a right to your opinion, but remember that this is just your opinion and does not mean anything. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best shows ever, and you'll soon accept that fact. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but do not deny it's brilliant.
