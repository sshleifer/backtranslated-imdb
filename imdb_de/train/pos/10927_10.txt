This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and is considered one of the most beloved shaw brothers of the late 70s. The plot is interesting and curvy, the characters are cool and each have their own style - toad, snake, lizard, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms films, but what about different kung fu Styles interesting? Display from the different characters. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that all Shaw Brothers are the same as Chang Cheh's films. Most of his films focus on the 10 tigers and the conflicts between Shaolin and Manchu. The movie is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
