After seeing the terrible, horrible, horrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew that I would have to see that as soon as I found out about what had previously looked like another bad-would-be filmmaker attempting an existing character to lend new depth. Instead, he was greeted with a BIG trailer for a movie that unfortunately does not exist, as I would love to watch a finished movie, even if it was only 30 minutes for BATMAN: DEAD END and some more. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the next short show!
