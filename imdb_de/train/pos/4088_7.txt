this one is out there. Not much to say except that it is a rarely-touched theme in Beast movies. I can see why this movie has been banned for so long, the issues covered within the movie are still a little taboo. It's a good movie that's well-played and has a purpose ... to shock the audience and cross the boundaries we often do not see in movies. I came across this movie on the net that I thought I could watch. I enjoyed the movie because it's thought-provoking and erotic at the same time. Something that is not uncommon in movies today.
