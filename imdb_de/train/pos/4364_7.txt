I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth watching. As a title character, Liam Neeson plays the same role he played for Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange does a great job as well as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person who is very likely to cause your skin to creep. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think that Hollywood has released two films that are almost in effect on England. Very well. With John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
