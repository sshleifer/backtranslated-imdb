I just started to watch the TV series "What is About You" and I have to say that it's a pleasure to look at it. I always like when new shows are going well, considering that many shows are going on before you can really get a feel for it. I've seen Amanda Bynes since "All That," she's really a weird girl. The best part about their comedy is that it's so natural and what I mean by that, it's something that a person here might say best friend is not rehearsed. <br /> <br /> I just started to watch the show and fell in love. I'm watching reruns from now on, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give the whole action something. It's nice to see an old face from other shows I've enjoyed in the past, like Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". The new characters are also very talented, Nick Zano has this charm that makes him love him, even if he does something wrong to make Holly (Bynes) I'm looking forward to seeing it grow.
