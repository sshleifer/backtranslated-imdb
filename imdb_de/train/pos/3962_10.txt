Wonderful James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. What makes this historic film about the FBI so good is the family element involved in a 35-year career, as portrayed by Stewart in the film. The film shows the story of the big investigative agency. It deals with aircraft bombing, the killing of Indians in Oklahoma for the acquisition of property, the fight against organized crime, Nazis and Communists in that order. The human element is never far behind when Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise 3 children when Miles' heart goes out with every use. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but memorable idea of ​​Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared in 1967 as Mr. Robinson in "The Graduate". The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He has undoubtedly brought the FBI up to date. <br /> <br /> While this may be considered as far-right propaganda, especially in Stewart's real republican views, it's well done, historically informative, and the view of the family so well represented.
