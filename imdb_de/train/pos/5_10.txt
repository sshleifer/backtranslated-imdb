I got into the middle of the movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credits or even the title until I looked it up here, where I see it was mixed by your commentators. I'm positive about this movie, but one thing that really caught my eye: the beautiful and delicate score written in a Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by none other than John Williams himself. Although he has written sensitive and poignant scores like Schindler's List, his name is usually associated with bombastic features like Star Wars. In my opinion, what Williams has written for this film surpasses everything I've ever heard for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, in keeping with the film's tender and affectionate storyline. And another of his most recent pieces, Catch Me if You Can, shows even more wit and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my valley and Konrack, that with John Voigt and his young African Americans in South Carolina and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectual spiritual awakening, a story that can not be told often enough. This is an excellent addition to this genre.
