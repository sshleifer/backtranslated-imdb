I sensed it on television by accident and could not resist ... It's really an excellent movie that gets people to experience American history with the Vietnam War, the Flower Power era, the battle of racism. It shows the conflict of generations, political views and race that took place in the 60s ... I was born in 1980, so I did not know everything before ... In France, the history of the US is not a priority and this movie really gave me a lot of facts! Incidentally, I think all the actors are great. especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than once a day !! It's really great ... what a shame that it only appeared on TV, not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
