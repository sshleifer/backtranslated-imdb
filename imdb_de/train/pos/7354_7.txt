I saw this movie on British television for the first time over 25 years ago and just found it back on a DVD copy on ebay last week. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful fashion plate poses and dresses, but the plot is weaker than the earlier Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding movie Spring in Park Lane. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, funny, daunting, seems to have a lot of fun and surpasses his form. It is worthwhile to look for him alone. Anna Neagle appears a bit matronal next to him and a little too old for the role she plays, but by the late 1940s her film partnership was well established and the cinema went public. Spring at Park Lane was a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote at length about his great appreciation for Herbert Wilcox, the director and instigator of this London film series.
