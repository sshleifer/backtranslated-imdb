I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite actors and one of the cutest actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of her films, but all from Jeremy Jordan. What I do not like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" gets arrested and "Jennifer" turns him down. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
