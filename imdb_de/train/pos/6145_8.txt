Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but that's still a nice movie. Angela Lansbury is superbly punctured as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has great fun as Mr. Brown. Her chemistry was also awesome. However, the children just lacked the same sparkle, though Paul is very funny and sweet. Actually, the songs were not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all songs are outstanding. The special effects were wonderful, they had a lot of magic and the story is original enough. But the highlights, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the football game, which was absolutely funny. The only other criticism was that I did not quite understand the end when I saw it for the first time. All in all a nice movie that hardly ever runs. Bethany Cox
