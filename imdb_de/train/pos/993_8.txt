Actually, this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well known actor is Jamie Kennedy from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who surprised me the most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than usual, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very personable person and in "Bait" almost the play On the contrary, a man without emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this movie are the different pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this movie maybe a bit dated. Overall, I thought that this was a pretty good little movie!
