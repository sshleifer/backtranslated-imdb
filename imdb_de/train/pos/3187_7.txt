Several years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs, each containing two movies. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternate title for The Greeks had a word for them) and this, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage music comedy that takes place in Scotland, and it's about false identities where one of the dancers gets carried away by a millionaire limousine. Vera-Ellen is this dancer and -wow, what legs! Ceasar Romero is her producer who, after leaving the original lead actress, takes a chance on her because he believes she is dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich guy who is mistaken for a reporter in search of Vera-Ellen to interview her, but is blocked by Romero. What I've just mentioned may be confusing, but it makes sense (usually) to be willing to examine your brain as you watch this charming screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers performed by exquisite wife Vera-Ellen , Romero can be a bit hectic here, but Niven gets ridiculously funny. The pressure I saw was pretty good, given its age and the fact that it's in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen is pretty good with her lines, since she's not really an actress. In this sense, I recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie lovers who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
