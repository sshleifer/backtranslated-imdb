In the episode of Watergate appeared some conspiracy films, like this, which was written by Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays veteran Vietnam veteran Roy Tucker, a loser who ended up in jail. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization designed to assist the wrongfully convicted. They offer him freedom, and despite mistrust, he accepts Tagge. But he brings along a colleague named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). That's why it's hard to see because Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker insane with stubborn sex, rather than what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br/> <br /> Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa in front of Tucker's astonished eyes Reunited with Mrs. Ellie (Candice Bergen) and with a new identity (strangely, he does not try to change his appearance, clearing the cheesy mustache would have been a start) he sits down but finds a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to be murdered no less than the president of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge kidnapped Ellie ... I'll leave the survey here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough plot holes for you to read the book (a nice trick!). The people who represent Tagge are never revealed. The allusions to the killing of J. F. K. are unmistakable. Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, there is still some doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. <br /> <br /> This was Stanley Kramer's first film in years, and although there is no turkey, he lacks the grasp of John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate" or Alan J.Pakula's "The Parallax View." Being a left-wing conspiracy film, he tends to sneak around his subject rather than deal with it. I prefer right-wing extremists themselves - they are funnier! 'Domino' has the look and feel of a TV-TV. Film and boasts what must be the simplest jailbreak in film history, not to mention an end to the Michael Caine classic "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes it observable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who died unfortunately this year, is outstanding as a mysterious Tagge, who seems to be behind the operation, until he is ruthlessly eliminated. He begins a chain of deaths that are intended to eliminate all traces of evidence one after the other. Offenders of this evil conspiracy fall - just like dominoes. As Tucker, the innocent farmer, Hackman is wonderful. However, you have to wonder why he hid in such a close proximity. In his shoes I would have fled to the other side of the world to escape these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with mountains slow the action down, and it's almost a relief when she's kidnapped. Presumably, the producers also thought this, which explains why it starts with a bizarre prologue that envisages the entire premise of the film voiced by British actor Patrick Allen, and warns the audience that "they" are out there and that "They" are out to be us. The comedian Les Dawson has this opening later in his B.B.C. Show 'The Dawson Watch'. <br /> <br/> Mickey Rooney had previously worked with Kramer on "Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World". His "death scene" here resembles an outtake from this image, where the actor looks like he was stung by a wasp and not shot. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy films used to be shot only by the left, but now there are the right ones. Last year, "Taking Liberties," an absurd mixture of lies and half-truths about the government of Tony Blair, proved to be Britain's answer to "reefer madness." At least "Domino" had the lovely Candice mountains. The best movie Chris Atkins could offer was Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "The Domino Principle" was made by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television gogul behind "The Saint", "Jesus Of Nazareth". and 'The Muppet Show'. He once again worked with Adam Kennedy in 1980 on "Raise The Titanic!" Whose failure was so great that Grade undermined the ambitions of being the new Louis B. Meyer. Being open-minded, I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
