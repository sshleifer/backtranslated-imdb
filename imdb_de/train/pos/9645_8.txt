"Presque rien" is a story of two young boys falling in love with each other during a summer stay at the seaside. I do not want to tell the plot because it's not the most important thing about this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best thing about this film is the cinematography. The visual side of 'Presque Rien' is so amazing that it deserves the highest note. It enchants you with its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is presented in an uneven, rather complicated way. There is neither a simple chronology nor answers to all the questions the film entails. But that makes 'Presque Rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all people for whom the artistic side of movies is very important and they will not be disappointed.
