"Father is still on business," was the criticism after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many think that the same but unique expression of Kusturica is still present in his new film and that critics can not touch him. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even if Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty spaces, he is still unique and untouched. Surprisingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and less landscapes than in "Life Is A Miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a fatal world-class potential for women, please do not spoil it. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
