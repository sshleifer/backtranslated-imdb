Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut Confessions of Dangerous Mind, they played together in this film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In Potential, this also seems to be a nice and entertaining project that matches movie remakes like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie is only half as successful, or at least not as good as it could have been , <br /> <br /> The movie, in which all of his characters are played by well-known actors, is a pity that the characters do not really have enough space to develop. Although they may have turned their potential into fun and funny characters, these are just characters that are mildly fun because they are mostly from some of the film's quirkier sequences. The fact that they are played does not change much, even if they prevent their characters from becoming boring or even annoying or anything at all. <br /> <br /> This is of course due to the fact that the signs are not fully exhausted. I can only assume that the Italian original film "I Soliti ignoti" runs much better than this film. The film relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling. Still, the movie is still a very funny movie, maybe because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless little caper movie you just do not have to worry about the story. In this context, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a film that works well and simply serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you will not regret once you've finished it, but it's also a movie that you can really make easy without ever being seen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
