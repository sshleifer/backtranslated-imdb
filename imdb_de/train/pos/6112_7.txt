It's a chick movie in the first place, it's a romantic comedy. There is a balance between the two. There are some pretty fight scenes in this movie. I do not think wires were used or if they were not exposed. It's not a terribly complicated movie, so it's gentle on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning. I would like it if they had produced the full potential of the girls looks just once, because they can be incredibly cute, but throughout the movie they remain quite aloof. I would see it again ... with a girl.
