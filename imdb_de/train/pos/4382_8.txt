Overshadowed by "Braveheart" in the same year, the two costume dramas beg for comparison. I admit that I'm biased against Mel Gibson and still "rationally preferred" Rob Roy. "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" show the story of the Scots in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic companion for individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note the use of Cornball in slow motion movies. His violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the latter property that makes it more attractive to the mindsets of young people. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" in sheer carnage (not to mention the yielding duration), the latter movie is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Their action is rather inconspicuous, but more surprising and clever. His sex is less noticeable, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. Their dialogue seeks to approximate the epoch's poetry. His rotten teeth in the mouths of the actors try to approach the dentistry of that time. And Tim Roth is a super villain. Also recommended: "The Last Mohicans" and "The Patriot". The latter resembles more "Braveheart" with its emphasis on the blood lust, the former rather corresponds to the "Rob Roy". All the above films earn their R rating for violence.
