My left foot is an epic, outstanding movie that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy and had a severe disability using only the left foot, but he was defiant, he succeeded in beating artists and writers all to become The Opportunity <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times and each time I see it I always find it brilliant. I wonder how this amazing movie did not win an Oscar for its best picture is a mess of Academy Awards. Jim Shirdan is for me one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and everything else is excellent in this film. As the movie continues, you would almost feel like you are in the brown household. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are as amazing as Cristie's parents, and Fiona Shaw is as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in his fight of defiance. <br /> <br /> The Irish film industry had a lot to do with her name before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish film. Movies as powerful and brilliant as the field, the weeping, in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were so highly regarded around the world and were nominated for several Oscars and won some, a wonderful period for the Irish film. My left foot is a powerful, outstanding movie. Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner playing the young Christy I, these two performances are two of the best movie appearances of all time, especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, which I would regard in the silence of the lambs as Antony Hopkins. Daniel Day-Lewis has proven in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent masterpiece in the movie, see it!
