Why am I so convinced that there is another movie version of this novel out there somewhere? I saw the movie again this year as I teach the novel, and find the changes in the movie annoying - the little boy does not appear in the novel and the ending has been changed. They kill him in the movie, but the whole point is that he is persecuted for years by the events at Eel Marsh House, but remarries and ultimately leaves events behind. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic figure in the novel. The scene in the movie in which Kipps set fire to the office is simply stupid, and the toy child's constant semblance of suggesting the child's presence is truly scary, but pointless - Kipps is hounded by the woman's revenge seeks, not the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that's getting better and closer to the novel and is actually more scary. Did I just imagine that?
