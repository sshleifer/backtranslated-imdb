The 40-year-old maiden made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it's a very sexual comedy. I just enjoyed a lot of the jokes and scenes in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect for the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer, and I think the scene where Andy removed his chest hair with wax is one of the coolest, especially because it's real. By the way, many of the actors and actresses present in this film are known or already famous. Andy Stitzer lives a peaceful life. He is a bit strange and collects a lot of toys, but looks harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends, they discover that Andy is indeed a virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends try to make Andy sleep with a woman. The problem is the confusion Andy gets into, especially now that he's really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when buying a DVD player in the shop where he works.
