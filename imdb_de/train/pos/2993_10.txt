Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as polemical cop, Jack La Rue as "darker" Italian and of course James Lee as "The Chinese Cook", this film is THE big secret of a murder in a locked room. For a movie from the early 1930s, this is a gradual "peeling away from the mystery" of the COLUMBO series, except that in this movie you do not have the benefit of knowing who the killer was in advance.
