I saw this movie on late night television years ago. At that time it was called "Stairway to Heaven". I remember being deeply touched by history as a young boy and surprised by the visual effects of the trial (those who saw it know what I'm talking about). Such an idea! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and imagination. This film features some of the greatest classics of all time: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is considered extremely high by IMDB voters, and rightly so - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10. Over 84% reported 8 or more out of 10. I was surprised that it was not listed in the top 250 movies until I realized that few had seen / rated this movie compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America) so that 1) I can buy it and 2) discover others this hidden treasure.
