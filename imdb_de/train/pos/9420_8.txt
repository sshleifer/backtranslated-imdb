The man in the white suit is one of the adorable comedies that Ealing studies in the 1940s and 1950s did so well. The plot of this film follows a man who invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. Of course, this is a big breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not so easy as the cloth threatens many people, including cloth manufacturers, the staff of the cloth factory and even an old lady who does her laundry every week. The man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances and the way they do not always help; As the old woman at one point in the movie says, "Why can not you just leave things alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many comedies by Ealing, this one shows Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor. He has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he literally does in this movie), but he also manages to portray his characters in a down-to-earth and credible manner. He is appropriately scary in this movie and captures just the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious, but somewhat naive scientist. In addition to Guinness, The Man in the White Suit features Joan Greenwood, the vocal actress who starred with Guinness in the simply divine "Child Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough by Alfred in the Batman films. The drama in the movie is not always great, but it's always decent and fits the movie. The man in the white suit is a smart, thought-provoking and funny comedy with a morality. The comedy is not always obvious and does not always work, but the movie is not supposed to be a movie that provokes a tummy tummy, so it's forgivable. I basically recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of movies.
