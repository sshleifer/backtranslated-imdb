I can admit that the script is not very good and has some slow parts, but all the critics of this movie have to learn how to have fun. Especially the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria). Michael Douglas proves he still has it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a fraudulent woman. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, play the dynamic duo and add their incredible talent to the pot. And second, this movie is the greatest fun I've had in a Theodore for years. It is quite simple if you want to go to the movies and have fun, The Sentinel.
