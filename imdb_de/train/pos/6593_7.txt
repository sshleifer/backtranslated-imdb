I've seen this movie twice now and think it's good for the limited equipment that made this movie. (Shot in 1947) Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of South American pre-Columbian Indians to the islands of Polynesia by overthrowing a raft of large balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and his crew as they select balsa trees in the Equidor and float with them down the river to the Pacific to assemble in Peru. You embark on a 101-day ocean adventure testing the strength of your primitive raft with only resources available to the natives of the time. Convince yourself, a real adventure!
