I only saw this movie once on TV and it was not repeated. This is strange when you look at the trash that repeats itself over and over again. Usually, horror movies are a source of entertainment for me, but that really scared me. The scariest part is when the people are following the preacher, where his wife is almost dead (they poisoned her). He asks who the hell are you anyway. One by one they give their true identity. The girl who pretended to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him says, "I am Lilith, the witch Adam loved before Eve."
