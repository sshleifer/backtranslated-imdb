Presenting Lily Mars is a really nice little movie that shows the comedies of actress Judy Garland and her standard vocal moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars, who was tagged for her big break after producer John Thornway. I think the comedy is easy and nothing too hard. I really recommend this movie to anyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
