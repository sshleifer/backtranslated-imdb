This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has very good acting with Hanks, Newman and all others. In any case, the best performance of Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, the cut is about as good and contains a great original score that really fits the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor that makes this movie special. It takes me a lot to defeat Godfather, but fantastic cinematography wins this competition. Definitely a Best Picture candidate in my book.
