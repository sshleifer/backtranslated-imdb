Religious bigotry is everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> A dingo tore a baby and the mother was tried and sent to jail for "killing" her own baby. I do not want to ruin the story for you, but you need to know the basics before you get deeply into what made this woman find herself in a jail. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and discover how deeply human hatred for people who are different continues to thrive around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving movie with a great cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See it!
