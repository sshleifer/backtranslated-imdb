Rock n 'Roll is a chaotic business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. The filmmaker is a project with serious ambition and maybe stupidity. He is able to repair seven turbulent years following two lumbering rock groups. With this abundance of high quality material, the film can captivate the audience. If you've ever been interested in any area of ​​the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a fascinating show. The music in the film, though it suffers only minimally from the necessary cropping and pasting, is worth the price of the recording alone. The next morning I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to buy a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I was already busy with the Dandy Warhols tunes). The film, which was defined primarily by the study of rock music, is successful at other, deep levels. Dig! is a sincere and sufficiently objective look into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to fight those forces.
