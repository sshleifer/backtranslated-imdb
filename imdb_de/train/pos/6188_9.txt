A murder investigation takes place on stage while The Vanities plays in front of an unknown audience on its opening night. A strange combination of musical and murderous mystery is worth a look because of its cast, its production number and the sheer novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the eye-catching role of a bitchy actress who wants to end the marriage between the stars of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which is also on one 70s album by Bette Midler). As the girls of the choir frolic behind the scenes, detective Victor McLaglen surrounds the girls as he tries to solve the murder of an unknown woman behind the scenes. We learn quickly that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) Brisson loves from afar that the dressing-room lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and the stage manager (Jack Oakie) bumps into everything. Many actions turn between the music numbers. The most famous song of the show is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where are they from?" And there's a weird rhapsody that turns into a Harlem specialty number with Duke Ellington. Totally in the cast. <br /> <br /> Something grandiose here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good too. Brisson is a total zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and also sees if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the showgirls.
