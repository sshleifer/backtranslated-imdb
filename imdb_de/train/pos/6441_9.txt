As Heavenly {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> This was a great human drama that excited my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that takes up the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted from his career and has to give up. When he joins a church choir as cantor, he makes a change in the life of the choirs, just as Jesus did in first-century society in Palestine. They laugh, start talking openly and truthfully, their mistakes are revealed, they accept each other, they love each other, they become a vital community. Among them is the mentally handicapped young man (? Tore) inclusiveness. <br /> <br /> The pastor Stig enjoyed authority by imposing a stifling morality on the church, and this is gradually being rejected by the choristers. When Stig dismisses Daniel, a rebellion ensues and Stig gets crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the time of Jesus, whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law was a stark contrast to the new life of the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. In a dramatic scene someone explains "the church invented sin". Throughout the film, there is this contrast between moralism and vital life. <br /> <br /> Faithful to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny as he beats him and makes him drown in the river. In the next scene, we can hardly believe it when Daniel's (revived!) Body is pulled into his room (the grave), which is wrapped in a white linen cloth (the shroud!) Of three women (three women were watching over the foot of the Cross) in the gospel). Daniel is attracted to Lena, a warm, beautiful young woman who has been cheated on by a man she loved and is now promiscuous (Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene). Lena (who was probably a first class courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he yearns for and now finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> In Gabriella's solo, composed by Daniel, unlike moral correctness, it is about fulfilling a life that leads to concern for sin and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows how the choir sings / hums in harmony, like a mantra that draws a large audience and illustrates the harmony and interconnectedness that is our true human destiny.
