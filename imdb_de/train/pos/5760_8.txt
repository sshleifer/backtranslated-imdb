My roommate ordered this from the internet some time ago and I finally saw it. It's rough. It's cheezy It's pretty stupid ... but it's also a lot of fun. I mean, that was the funniest movie we've seen since "City Of The Walking Dead". It was like being back in the old drive-in theater! You could tell the guy who made this movie that he liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. This one has all the clich√©s and tricks from these movies in one, and it's neat because it's SUPPORTED to be like that. The cheeze factor is high, the gore is flowing and the laughter is rolling! The effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one with a guy's heart shoved through his chest are both excellent! Acting goes from awful to actually pretty good. There is not much plot, just a lot of blood. I think this is patterned after the zombie movies from Italy and Spain, because they get stuck in the rough scenes forever, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B Grade stuff, then you can not go wrong. A nice way to waste a Friday night!
