I saw this funny little movie in 1979 at the age of 10/11 when it aired on CBS. I did not know that it was in a theater at all. To rate it from the children's point of view, I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars, as it was a little boy at the time, it seemed a bit "girlish". The climate scene in which Gazooks was Every day it was a bit disturbing that the daylight tickle, but you grow out of something like that. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered a blockbuster video in 1995, I had to visit it again! I liked it anyway, although it looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer came up with the idea that he was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. Maybe even on DVD, I hope at least. I would like to share it with my children someday! 10 stars here, it's still a great kids movie. (End) <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally a VHS copy found !! Woo-hoo!
