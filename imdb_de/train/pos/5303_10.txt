John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live near Washington, DC) with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker gets bigger than his city can handle, and he is separated from his beloved art manager (including a sexy Ricci) by his lovely art manager. The image left a refreshing taste in my mouth - a bit like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although that taste was rather flat and simple, it just made it deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to carry arms ... and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
