"Sasquatch Hunters" was not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Woods, Park Rangers Charles Landon (Roger Gordon (Matt O'Loord) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet (Stacey Branscombe) escort dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White) her boss dr. Ethan Edwards (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton (Juliana Dever), to find the location of some found in the area bones. As they set up camp, the team discovers a huge burial ground and stranger bones scattering the area. When members of the group disappear, they migrate through the woods to safety. It has been discovered that a Sasquatch is behind the murders, and the team has teamed to survive. <br /> <br /> The good news: That was not as bad as I thought. The movie really starts to steam halfway when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes as the entire group is exposed to attacks by the creature and the tension is extremely high throughout the playout. The wooded area is best milked in these parts, increasing the tension and wondering when a single person wandering in the forest gets their attention. The generous use of growls and roars, which are really foreign to the world, is widespread in the film. They really do a lot to make this part so scary, as in other cases, when the growl belongs to loud screaming. It's pretty effective and works fine. It's pretty nice that the later part of the movie speeds things up as it looks pretty good on a high action note. A scene that I need to feel special is a special scene at first sight. As a man runs from the creature through the forest, he discovers the expedition that has been looking for it. He raises his hands to ask for help, and as he announces his presence, he is attacked from nothing and hastily killed. It surprised me and actually gave me a small jump at the first sight. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There were only a few things to complain about, and you have a common complaint. The creature here is mostly portrayed by a terrible CGI, making it look ridiculously stupid and destroy any credibility it might have. The air evoked from the film opening is almost shot out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so distracting that it's a shame if not more work was done. I've complained a lot about it, and it's something that should really be eliminated, as it does not look so realistic and is quite fake. Another big one is the off-screen kill here. Very often a person is grabbed in the film and then torn away and then found the bloody body. It's pretty annoying when the kills look nice and juicy afterwards. Otherwise, I do not really have much to do with this, because everything else that's usually criticized does not really bother me, but it's for people other than this stuff. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: I kind of liked this piece, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It should not be taken seriously, and when you see it that way, it's actually a treat. Fans of these films should take a look, and those who like the Sci-Fi Creature features might find some nice things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and some graphic carcasses
