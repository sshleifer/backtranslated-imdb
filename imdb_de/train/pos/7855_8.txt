Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that I wanted to get some time ago. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her typical spunky, innocent sexy portrait of a girl on the wrong track that inherits the heart of a rich heritage. Only this time the stakes are higher: a false murder charge, an illegitimate child (and a consequent case of false motherhood) and a suicide. <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford wanted to repeat this attempt. History is a true moral story, the way she liked to play. The controversial topics are not always clear. A viewer has to be careful and seek clues to capture everything that is implied at first viewing. Although in the end everything is more or less explained. <br /> <br /> The only negative comment I can make concerns Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character Ben Letts looks about 6-2, 200 pounds (of course bigger than Mary), is panicked when a 60-pound chocolate lab approaches. To top it off (or perhaps to justify his amazing fear of the dog), he manages to fix him on the ground and somehow hurts him so much that he still has to fight to get up much later. This is the same lovely lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles with Mary! But Mary later throws boiling water into Ben's face, which hardly slows him down! OK, I've aired on Ben and the Chocolate Lab! Besides that, the movie was quite touching and caught my attention. Pickford's support was strong and believable. This is certainly among their better films.
