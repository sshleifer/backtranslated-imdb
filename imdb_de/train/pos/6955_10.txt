My Super X girlfriend is an incredible roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the costumes Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an undervalued comedian, but she has proven everyone wrong and nailed her role as a crazy girlfriend. She was just fantastic !!! Luke Wilson was also good as average Joe, but he was brave to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The side cast was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was extremely good (much better than in the series Scary Movie). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did a very good job of making this movie and Uma Thurman would not have done that well. This film is clearly a 10/10 cast (Uma Thurman), the director, the script and the original plot. This movie is highly recommended.
