When I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what it was about in the 60s. I know that I might be wrong on some things, but it seemed that the 1960s really had an impact on the people of that time. Some people said they would want to return to the 60s. After all that I have seen, I would say no to the excitement and to the result. But that's my opinion.
