I loved so much about this movie ... the time it took to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the outstanding performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that is not suitable for anyone who wants the typical fast action movie. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I would say that this movie is a bit of a Shakespearean tragedy. Since we do not, we say it's more of a drama suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in the way relationships and topics are examined. Much of the story is shown rather than narrated. What I find makes it more subtle and moving - and it works well for a story based on a comic (or comic book). At times I felt like I was in the thirties, part of that story - there was such a realistic, yet gorgeous, narrative quality. <br /> <br /> I often do not put films in front of the books they were founded on, but in that case I do. (Although I liked the book very much.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it contains some wonderfully deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin, who is a bit younger than the boy in the movie to see it, after seeing it for the first time because he has problems at home and me wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion on father-son issues with him, he loved it - and the discussion.)
