For a long time "The Menagerie" was my favorite episode "Star Trek", even though it has been overshadowed by "City on the Edge of Forever" in recent years. What I preferred to 'Menagerie' was that it's more hardcore Star Trek with this intriguing backstory of the then-current trek story. I still think it's awesome how Gene Roddenberry built the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is essentially an excuse for Kirk and some others (and us) to see the pilot, the idea that Spock was court-martialed is a smart idea. You can put holes in the drawing if you want. After all, given the Talosians' ability to control domination and the state of Captain Pike, why is it necessary to physically return Pike to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think too much about the details and just enjoy ST's only two-parter.
