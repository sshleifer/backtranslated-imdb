I have a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie shows how many of them are unfortunately. They are very cunning, reckless and greedy and extremely unfair. I experienced all this in Russia, from robotic sex, the urge for gifts, lies and betrayal. I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the photo trips of my three trips to Russia looking for a bride. It contains thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls I've met, black comedy, scams that I've gotten used to, and the story of my raid and appearance on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a lot of time assembling it. So look at it. The Russian woman who plays Nicole Kidman is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photojournals. <br /> <br /> My 3 bride seeking travels in Russia are very exciting and would sell so do not make it a movie from my bride who is looking for adventure in Russia? However, there is a de facto impossibility in this film, and in this way the man orders his bride from a catalog and lets her arrive at an airport. It does not work that way at all, so I do not understand why the media like to perpetuate it. There is not a single Russian website on which the introduction of the bride works that way, and I urge everyone to find one that does. The fact is that you can only order the CONTACT INFO of the Russian woman (e-mail address, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there you correspond and visit them, and if you want to bring them to your country, start the immigration process in your INS office and wait months afterwards. This is how it works in real life. You can not just order her to arrive at your airport. US immigration would NEVER allow that to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted when I went abroad! You can also! http://www.happierabroad.com
