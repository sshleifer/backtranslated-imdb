This is the true story of how three British soldiers fled the German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III during the Second World War. This is the same prisoner-of-war camp that held the Great Escape, which led to the killing of 50 remanded officers by the Gestapo (later turned into a very successful movie of the same name). <br /> <br /> While the other prisoners of war in Stalag Luft III work on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two British prisoners came up with the idea of ​​building a wooden vaulting horse near the Composite wire fence, which would shorten the distance that would take them from this starting point to freedom. The idea of ​​building their version of the Trojan Horse came to them as they discussed "classic" escape attempts and observed some POWs playing a jump frog on the site. <br /> After two hidden prisoners of war, the wooden horse could be brought close to the fence every day. While volunteer POWS jumped over the horse, the escapes inside the horse were busy digging a tunnel under the vaulting horse while they were near the wire, under the wire, and into the forest. <br /> <br /> The story also describes the dangers faced by two of the three refugee prisoners of war when they traveled through Germany and occupied Europe after leaving the tunnel. All three prisoners of war who tried to escape actually made home runs (successfully reaching their home base). The wooden horse conveys a very accurate and true sense of the excitement and events of a POW outbreak. The film was shot in the places where the two POWs were on their run. With a far less budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic, if not more exciting, than The Great Escape, and you will not fail to keep you from the edge of your seat to make the prisoners of war their escape. <br /> <br /> The storyline is crisp and the game looks true and taut enough to sustain the suspense throughout the movie. Based on the eponymous book by Eric Williams, one of the runaways, The Wooden Horse is by far the best POW escape story ever made in a movie. Some of the prisoners of war were used in the film to repeat their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III. I give this movie a deserved ten.
