I was just finished with the movie and wanted to contribute my own opinion (and my justice) to the film. <br /> <br /> To be clear, this movie does not pretend to be anything but solid action comedy. It does not aim to revolutionize the film industry and gain critical reviews, nor does it want to be considered one. If you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, you should reject your critical attitude and longing for a good plot, as you will not find anything here. After that has established, let us continue in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this film just because it did not have a strong plot (yes, movie goers, I also underestimated this movie), but I never thought I would enjoy this movie that way. I even enjoyed that more than the Stephen Chow movies (which I consider Kung Fu Hustle to be the best performer and also rated a 9). The action is tight and epic as the comedy slows down in the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILER's alarm, I think the action is unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie anyway? There are many other sports films (drama) that have already done well. SPOILERS end <br /> <br /> I do not even know why you read this. Go ahead and watch. Remember, do not think - you just have to watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> Every now and then (the movie industry) they create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they make films that are better on the dump. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition the previous examples have. When we talk about Stephen Chow comedy, this is one of the top ten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you love: -no cinema movies with really good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -what the hell, look at that. You will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
