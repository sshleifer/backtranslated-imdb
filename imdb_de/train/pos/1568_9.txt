Catscratch is the best that comes from Nickelode, including Wayne Knight. This show does not just appeal to Maoris and PI. Some people love it and they are all out there. At first glance, I admit that it looks a bit rough, but it grows huge with you. To correct something that other critics have said, In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say, "Does that mean you're homo now?" he says, "Does that mean you're homo, owww?" This is his sentence in the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, the funniest of them all, like Peww-Weww's Playhouse. <br /> <br /> First, I have to admit that the early episode was a bit good. But after a while, the consequences became great! And just when the show had found it to be unreal and crazy ... Nickelodeon breaks it off! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is meant for kids, but now and then a brilliant show that teens can enjoy and adults appears. These shows include Mr. Bean, the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes), and Invader Zim. All this must have been considered too good, except for CatDog, because Nick felt the need to break it. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous last episode in which Gordon fights a duck. <Br /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with lots of audio commentary and behind-the-scenes docos and the last episode. <br /> <br /> But of course what I would definitely like to see the show back in the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list of all the gag closing credits somewhere on the internet. That would be great.
