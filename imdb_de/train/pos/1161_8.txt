The budget was extremely low (it looks like they were being recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good plotline and is easy to follow. 8 years after filming with her sexually abusive stepfather, Amanda Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor, with whom she secretly has an affair. The doctor rents her a house and buys a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the film Amanda kills him and buries him in her garden. Then she sees that her neighbor Richard looks at him and stops at nothing until she has him. She seems innocent, but after another neighbor Buzz found out that Amanda had killed that doctor and tried to kill Richards wife Laurie (this is after Amanda and he got it in the hot tub). Then she stops being so innocent and kills Buzz and later tries to kill Richard, whom she allegedly loves and cares for. And you have to borrow the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. All in all a good movie, it reminds me of my life. You know that the whole case falls on the neighbor and does not stop at anything until you separate him.
