I finally looked at these episodes in 2008 and constantly had to go back to check when they were actually produced. They are absolutely scary because they made fun of the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush, or they are those weird, weird people who take care of things. Boo, scary! Bush's fraternal brothers attacking the White House as Arabs with guns? Bush "inadvertently" executing someone? (No, wait, he did that somehow as a government.) This seemed a failure at the time as a sitcom, but now it has to be seen as a brilliant, if creepy, prejudice.
