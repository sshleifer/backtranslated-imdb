Hello Playmates. I first saw this movie for the first time and it's also my first experience with Arthur Askey. I have to admit that I was very impressed by this movie. A fan of black-and-white films in general, Pass to Pimlico, the lavender hill mob, and Tommy Trinder (who seems to be a distant relative), this film has been well received for providing good British British humor. I find that there are some who have criticized the performance of Askey, but in my opinion, the time has proved to be a good example of the 40s comic drama. If anything, the picture helps to create characters that are more than mere clich√©s. Movies now seem to dominate. If you can get this movie, I would recommend that you take it, pity that these films are usually no longer shown on Sunday afternoons. I am also glad that I had the opportunity to see another play by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in the Father's Army). Thank you
