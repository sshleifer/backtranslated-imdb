A very addictive series. I had never seen an exact combination of drama, action, suspense and science fiction. I am impressed every chapter. The script is very smart, I do not know how the creators invent all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past problems, stormy relationships, there is the human sensitivity that is required to create an intimate characters <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related to each other: the numbers that they have met before, without knowing it, and so on. The other, the mysterious security system and the Darma Initiative are elements that make us lose no chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this amazing story?
