As a kid I found this movie great. It had animals, it had beautiful music and it was my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Well, I still love this movie for a variety of reasons. It has well-trained animals undergoing various stunts and scenes in front of the camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical that fits in perfectly with the scenes, with rousing, fast melodies and the heartbreaking main theme that still makes me cry. Even if people hum it. And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on a book, this is the story of three pets, a smart, overly trusting and considerably paternal lab called Shadow, a witty and futile - but still smart - cat with a fear of water called Sassy and a street, the ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, chance. The three are brought to a friend's farm when their family leaves. Distraught and worried, the pets break out and plan a journey through the Sierra Mountains for the journey of a lifetime. A really incredible journey. So, maybe home is just over this mountain. But if not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound to people who like the three amazing actors who provide the voices for the main animal characters, and for all the others who ... yes, everyone is watching.
