This movie I loved since my youth! It is excellent. For the average movie watcher though, it may be a bit much if you can not interpret certain subtleties in the movie (for example, our hero's name is Achilles and in the final fight between him and Alexander he's shot with a shot in the heel rocket, like Achilles in the mythology was shot in his heel). That's just a small fact, which is somehow amusing! Anyway, a great movie, a good story, it would be nice to see it again with today's special effects! Strangely enough, Gary Graham had an average success and starred in the TV show Alien Nation. This movie is a funny watch and should be more appreciated!
