BABY FACE is one of the better "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown in the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK last night after the WATERLOO BRIDGE version of 1931, so I could watch the movie for four minutes as it is now. <br /> <br/> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she may have known the drunken parents of "Myra" - Mae Clarke - in WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of her mother and (in the reconstructed dialogue) he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old. Now she is a waitress and part-time whore in his office hours, her closest friend is Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant who Barrett harasses again and again. It is one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she stays to her father because of Harris and threatens to go when Harris gets fired (and because it's the grubby workers like Nat Pendleton who prefer seeing Stanwyck's service The Taste of Hooch The one he serves makes Barrett obey her. <br /> <br /> The one who regularly comes to Speakeasy and likes Stanwyck is cobbler and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier)., who has great potential in Seeing the spirited girl when she will simply leave her abandoned home, he is also pushing the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche and the idea of ​​the will to power, more on that later. <br /> <br /> After seeing the local political grandmother ( Defeated Arthur Hohl) and argued with Barrett, Barrett kills an explosion, and Stanwyck can leave her hometown She and Harris travel to New York City, where they use a brakeman (Jam Murray) received a free transport by train. They reach New York, and after walking around they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873), and the friendly guard tells them where the staff office is. Slowly we watch Stanwyck climb the ladder top, similar (but more slippery) than Robert Morse dared to win in business without really trying. But Morse was a man in a male-dominated society. Stanwyck knows her sexual attraction is her weapon. It goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a part of the movie I always thought was the most shocking - oddly enough - when I looked at him), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent. Each ends for them and is either pushed aside when it is no longer useful or destroyed by it. Brent, the new president of the bank founded by his grandfather, eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent has bought her a fortune in jewels and given valuable bonds). Brent is being charged. Will she stand up for him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER NEXT: <br /> <br /> The most important thing about these films, which is not allowed to dictate that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still endings. The original ending had Stanwyck boarding a ship for Europe that Brent had left to his fate, but when he realized that she could not do it to him, he returned to his apartment building and found he had shot himself. She rides with him to the hospital when it ends. Now, before the rediscovered footage was found, the film ended up apparently spending all the bank's money to save it, and retired to East St. Louis to live happily when he was poor. <br /> <br /> are good ends. Stanwyck was to continue her destructive course, with Brent being the last of her victims. But even without the Breen office, the screenwriters (by the way, one of Darryl Zanuck) saw fit to find a moral center. She has none - at least not for powerful men (who hates her). I do not believe that a depression audience would have tolerated that kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems due to changing public opinion and changes in society. It was a world of men in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck did her work for her. Wood (when fired for indiscretion with him) admits he did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006 Stanwyck would have found women everywhere. There are some nasty, shabby comments in the film (obviously some based on jealousy) to other secretaries and employees of Stanwyck on their fast ascent. In 2006, she often faced female supervisors, and she would cut her legs very quickly. If she finds out that there are one or two lesbians, she might be able to try, but it is doubtful. And she never seems to meet men who are gay. They have gay male executives in the business who do not care about their legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there's your mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is redone in the "Bowdlerized" version to make her seek a moral center. In reality, he urges Nieztsche, but as the National Socialists (in the broader sense) have driven Nieztsche - find your way to power and urge him. While Nieztsche sometimes emphasized power, this was not the alpha and omega of his theories. Otherwise nobody would read him in college classes today. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half-trained. In short, if someone who had thoroughly studied Nieztsche confronted Cragg, he would make him look like a half-formed fool. And that's Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and worth a 10 for the day ... but seriously flawed.
