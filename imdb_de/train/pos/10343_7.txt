"Amazing Mr. Williams" plays Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, including Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who has shot ALSO five films this year, three of which made THREE together! Douglas is Lt. Williams, and he and his comrades are presented with a corpse, and they have to find out what really happened. The viewers will recognize his co-workers - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always played authority positions ... senators, bank presidents, cops. This who-dunnit has a bit of a comedic flair - the cops are always jabbing, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. Some funny gags - Williams even takes the man they've arrested on a date with his girlfriend. There are a lot of fun things here, so get over the slow start and wait for the funnier later. You do not want to give away spoilers, so you have to see them in Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall mainly made comedies and was allegedly engaged to Lucy.
