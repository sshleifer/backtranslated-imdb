I've seen a lot of PPVs in the past, but this is the most entertaining, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD extras are worth it because they give a different view of the wrestlers' behavior after the show (eg the interview with Chris Benoit / Randinterview). Some insights into the Monday Night Wars era, the first game of the Hogan gold winner, and a publicity talk. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1st Day Team Table Game: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs.. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This was a pretty good and intense match to start the show. Not too many holds and only pure physics. Spike can compete in league fights and Guerro and Benoit have good wrestling abilities on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2nd WWE Crusher Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really did not care about both wrestlers and did not care until Kidman did a shooting star press. Normally, people in a Cruiser Weight Championship expect a lot of flying, but that had very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble met his finisher, nobody cared or knew about it (you can tell by the fact that the camera is not blinking). The end, however, was fast. <br /> <br /> 3rd WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy William Regal 5/10 As a wrestler, I never really loved it, it lacks in intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but had no chance to show off his high-flying act, although he still made some good counterattacks and needed a fast pace for the game. It ended quickly and was perfect for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena of Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to look back at Cena's first PPV, how he used to behave, how he dressed and what he looked like (watch his interview, it's pretty funny). This was a good, intense match where Cena showed a nice selection of holds, suplexes, counters and some antennas. Jericho was below average, but definitely helped Cena at the start of his career. Cena wins. <br /> <br /> 5th WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good game. Both wrestle styles fit really well on the screen, with Brock's pure power and raw energy compared to RVD's skill and speed. RVD looked great in this match (better than his later matches with Edge and Cena), and the entire match was fast. The end worked perfectly as Brock retained the undefeated series, while giving RVD only his desserts in his home country. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification Game: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked some intensity in the RVD match, but still a good follow-up. Although it started a bit slow (which is always the case with big shows), Booker T was impressive and made a sick step on the announcer's table. The finisher was fantastic, the end was a big surprise and a big step forward for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7th WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre game. Hogan comes out as usual to a big pop, but his variety of movements lacks that intensity and energy. On the other hand, Christian does not have the greatest athletic ability. This was a mediocre game at best, but it was still fine for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for the undisputed championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Just the game of the year. This is by far the best triple-threat match I have ever seen. There were close crashes, many finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. Nobody could predict who would come out of this. If you want to buy this DVD, I would definitely buy it for this game. All in all, this was a solid PPV with lots of extra treats that you can watch over and over again. Although this is hard to find (I had to pay a bit more than usual for this DVD), it is definitely worth your money.
