"Hate of a Minute" is probably one of the better films from Michigan in recent years. Not to say it's a brilliant movie, it's definitely worth a watch. <br /> <br /> "Hate" tells the dirty adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a formerly abused child who has since grown up and is beginning to listen to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is visually very nice. The pictures are creative and the lighting is correspondingly atmospheric and interesting. This movie, in contrast to other recent releases in Michigan, such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies", has a productive value. Subtle dolly shots and stylized shot compositions show that the budget of this film of 350,000 US dollars is well used. <br /> <br /> However, "hate" stumbles in the same places as in many other local movies. Essentially, things happen somehow. Eric Seaver is not developing at all. Basically, he was always crazy, it's just that people notice. The film moves only with little development on its funny way. The end too is very abrupt. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror movie, since when have we been interested in the actions? We just want people to die and deliver "hate" anyway. As the body count rose, people in the theater cheered, "Kill them, kill them all!" When people shout back on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where "hate" succeeds. It is fun. And in the end, that's all that matters.
