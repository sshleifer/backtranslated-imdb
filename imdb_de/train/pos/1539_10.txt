I saw that at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of Mrs. Blom, it is beautifully done and performed. A large group of characters could come from an Anne Tyler novel, d. H. They are overlaid with back stories and potential layers of the future, there are no false notes, surprising outbursts of humor amid self-inflicted anxiety and very real, if not earth-shaking, dilemmas. If you've seen "The Best of Youth," you'll see how well the characters are drawn through small moments, even as the story progresses swiftly. I really hope this will be distributed in the US. I live in a pretty demanding movie market, but we rarely get Swedish movies.
