Unfortunately SpaceCamp appeared at about the same time as the Challenger Explosion. What really makes a ripple when it is brought out or even if it should, bring it out. I'm glad they did. For the first time I saw SpaceCamp in a drive-in cinema. That really improved the ad. <br /> <br /> While listening to Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the others in the movie. So it was a big shock for me to find all these young people who really work well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where the kids were shown how to act as a team. The scenes in which the children were prepared for a trip, they could only hope. The actual launch of a spacecraft is of course an old news for us. This one was different. All in all, this is one of my most cherished films. Escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. Probably rented 30 - 40 times. I finally found it in a particular store and bought it. Well, if it only appears on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets a 9 out of 10 points from me.
