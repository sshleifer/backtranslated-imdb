First things first, this movie is amazingly beautiful. As someone working on 3D CG movies as a lighter / compositor, I was blown away by the visuals. Every second I was stunned by what was on the screen. As for the story, it's okay. It's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your Blade Runner's futuristic tales (and who can not?), You'll feel fine that the voice output was particularly boring and distracting from the entire movie. I saw it in English at the cinema, but I hope there is a French version somewhere. Definitely worth a visit.
