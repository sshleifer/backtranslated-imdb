A bit slow (kind of like a Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very compelling film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories of what it feels like to be in her old age. The confusion and uncertainties are presented in a very simple, yet lifelike way. The music is perfect and the spectacle is incredible. The camera works great too. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back on that particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and desires. I would also say it's a good movie for young people going through this time. There have been so many movies about puberty, but that really captures the true essence of the discovery of the adult world of romance and its complexity.
