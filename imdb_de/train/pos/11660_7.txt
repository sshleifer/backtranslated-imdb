A beautiful piece of children's cinema, buried in a world of archaic Celtic. He tells the story of the famous Kelser Book, which was believed to be monks of the small island of Iona off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of a young apprentice who is absentminded in the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the wild horseman of pagan mythology. Hoping to find a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The true beauty of the film lies in its animation. Cells shaded in a bright and inspiring style of deep complexity are less straightforward. The Secret of Kels comes from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series "Samurai Jack" for its ingenious use of marker marking and background depth, creating a consistently affective Celtic world that lives under the shadow of the Viking invasion the lifestyles are without realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant, as the film fits into a world of fantasy and Celtic revivalist mysticism. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is when it glides from branch to branch. It appears and disappears like a mysterious nymph with features that resemble the legendary Cheshire cat of Alice and Wonderland. The secret of Kels is an absolute pleasure. For all genders of all ages it is a nice piece of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not expect impressions, but pleasant impressions!
