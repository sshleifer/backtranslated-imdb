I saw that in the theater and immediately thought that owning a video was good enough. I'm still a big nut for sci-fi action movies. <br /> <br /> Without revealing history, it's worth sci-fi without much thought. The story is simple and the plot is very good. It is worth seeing! <br /> <br /> Maybe they're doing a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 points
