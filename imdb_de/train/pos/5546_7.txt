Some people say that this is the best movie PRC has ever released. I'm not sure about that because I have a place in my heart for some of their secrets. I'll say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio, major or minor, have ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of a mistaken ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all who have lynched him and all their offspring. In this mixture comes the granddaughter of a ghost victim, the current ferryman. She takes over the ferry business while the ghost runs into the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Set in thick fog and primarily set on the only swamp set, this is more a musical poem than a regular feature film The rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early scenes, are poetic to them. Similarly, camerawork has a similar cadence as it moves back and forth across the swamp, as if it were crossing the door between life and death, innocence, and guilt. The movie reminds me more of an opera or oratorio or music lesson than a normal horror movie. It's an amazing piece of film that's probably unique in film history. <br /> <br /> This is not a guild of Lilly. This is a low budget horror / mystery that will tell you a nice little story that will entertain you. Her story of love and revenge is what matters, not poetic filming, and it keeps you first and foremost (the technical aspects that are just show-windows). Although the mist creates a mood, it also hides the fact that this swamp is completely on land. The constant back and forth is alright for a while, but you still want to see something different after 58 minutes. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really like the movie. It's a good little movie that, as I wished, I was a little less affected by poverty. It is definitely worth a look if you can find it.
