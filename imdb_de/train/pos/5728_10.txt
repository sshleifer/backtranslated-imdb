I went to this movie and expected an artistic scary movie. What I got was fear for fear. It's a horror movie in the core. It's not boring like other horror movies in which a ghost house has only ghosts and blood. This movie does not even show the majority of deaths, but the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept of not only tracking the house, whoever goes indoors. They are tracked no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some of the external reviews, I am really surprised that critics did not like this movie. I will see it again this week and I am very excited. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should. It scared the shit out of me.
