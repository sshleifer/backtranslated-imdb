Castle of Blood is a fine example of the quality work of the horror genre that was developed in Italy in the 60s. The movie has all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes almost every movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a haunted castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero assumes that he can spend the night in the castle and return to pick up his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night of every year in which the dead return to experience their death. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I see in the movie is the running time. It feels almost padded. There's a lot of the first act that literally does not happen. Our hero stumbles in the dark and finds nothing interesting. As soon as he finds something, however, the movie becomes quite appealing. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is an absolute must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror.
