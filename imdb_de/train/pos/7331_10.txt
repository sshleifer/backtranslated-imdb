In a time of magic, in Barbados and demons, there is a vicious tyrant named Nekhron and his mother Queen Juliane, who lives in the Iron Realm and wants to conquer King Jerol's reigned fire region when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was abducted. Nekhron's thugs must have a warrior named Larn protect her and defeat Nekhron before taking over the world and kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> A well-made and superbly underrated fantasy epic combines live performers with animated animations (rotoscoping), it's just the second best movie by Ralph Bakshi, with "American Pop" number one and "Heavy Traffic "the third and" Wizards "is the fourth. It is certainly better than his "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork was designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has a good color scheme and there is also a hottie for the guys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all fantasy and animation lovers, especially the new Blue Underground 2 Disc Limited Edition DVD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian." "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal", "Starchaser: Legend of Orin", "Fantastic Planet", "Princess Mononoke", "Nausicca: Valley of the Wind" , "Conan the Destroyer", "Willow", "The Bride of the Princess", "The Lord of the Rings (1978)", "The Sword in the Stone", "Excalibur", "Army of Darkness", "Krull", " Dragon Heart, King Arthur, The Hobbit, The Return of the King (1980), Conquest, American Pop, Jason and the Argonauts, The Battle of the Titans, The Last Unicorn , The Secret of NIMH, The Flight of the Dragons, Hercules (Disney), Legend, The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, and the Goblet of Fire.
