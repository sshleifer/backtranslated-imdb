I may be biased, I am the author of 1994's novel The Hungry Bachelors Club. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character Marlon in the movie. I can not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the movie in its entirety and will continue to comment on it. But Jorja Fox, who plays my character, Delmar Youngblood, is outstanding. She wears most of the emotional vehicles in fine form. I could not have done better! This looks like real people, barely formula-driven, and, thankfully, drives my testimony home against racial prejudices, gracefully and heartfelt.
