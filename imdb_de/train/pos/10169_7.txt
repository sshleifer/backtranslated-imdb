Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie. It was decent and entertaining, but still pretty funny. There were a few clich√©s, but I found most of the stuff fresh. At first, I did not think it would be good. If it got past the first 20 minutes, the movie gets more interesting. This movie did not start in funny laughter and was not wonderful either. It was just a movie you can sit down and enjoy how beautiful it was. I can not see how bad this movie was. The rating is just too low. I could have dealt with 5.5, but with 4.8, and also this film A 1 is a shame. It was pretty good, and there was nothing terrible enough to give a 1, which most people gave her.
