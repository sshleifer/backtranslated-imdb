I saw this movie by luck just because I was going through a phase where I found a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his latest films, and thank God! This movie has stayed with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls embarking on a dramatic journey to a foreign land where they will experience the true meaning of freedom. Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before they went to college, but their journey ended up being much more complicated. The struggle they undergo while they are arrested in Thailand and become prisoners is very moving and intense. The acting is fantastic, the pictures extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and just right for the movie and the message is definitely powerful. I can not even find the right words to describe how I feel about this movie every time I look at it. I know that some people did not appreciate the movie as much as I did, but I swear to you, you have to see that !!! I promise it will stay with you!
