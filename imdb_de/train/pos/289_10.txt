I love all the films of Michael Landon Jr. and Michael Landon Jr.'s casting by Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has the potential to bring this character to life. <br /> <br /> This movie took me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The death of Missie & Willie's baby girl with the timing of Clark's The visit was only God's time. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them was a father's love. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies before this [Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I think you can see and understand this movie easily. Still, watch the last 3 movies because of the story that all the characters have left behind. Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director. I'm looking forward to many more films from him in the future.
