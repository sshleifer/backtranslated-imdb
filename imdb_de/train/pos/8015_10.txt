I saw this movie for the first time in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still tears me apart. The Muppets are so cool and they go in a refreshingly naive way to the show business. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whisper on behalf of Kermit in a fancy restaurant. This is a smart and funny movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
