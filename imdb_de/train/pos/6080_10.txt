Othello, the classic Shakespearean story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember that I studied this story in high school. Actually, I found that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespearean story because it was fascinating because Shakespeare captured the sense of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, if you really study this story, you might be dealing with so many philosophies why Othello went mad with jealousy in an instant. Later, I also looked at this version of Othello and have to say that she was absolutely awesome. Lawerance and Kenneth just catch the story so well and understand it's dark. <br /> <br /> Othello is the greatest soldier in his city, he is loved by all, including the king. When the king finds out that Othello has sneaked away with his daughter Desdemona, the king is furious, but disregards him. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, to his side man instead of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Because of his crazy jealousy he wants to take revenge. Even though he pretends to be Othello's best friend, he only tiredly hints at Othello that Desdemona cheats on him with Cassio, never says that they are, only makes Othello make it happen. Othello is crazy and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help. <br/> <br /> Othello is an incredible story. I strongly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that makes you think after reading. The film by Othello is great too and I recommend it again, it captured the story perfectly and feels like a tearjerker, or you might be in shock about what's going on between Othello and Desdemona. Love would betray him. This is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets and good direction. That's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
