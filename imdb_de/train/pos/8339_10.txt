I.Q. I think is a sweet, charming and funny romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a boring guy. For me Ed (Tim Robbins) was better suited for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie did a great job. Finally, I recommend this cute, charming and funny romantic comedy to find the right person for you, any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who has not seen her yet. There is a lot of laughter, so go to the video store, lend it or buy it, sit back with a friend and look at it.
