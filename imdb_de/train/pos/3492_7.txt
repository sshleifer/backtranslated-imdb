Not as bad as I had imagined. <br /> <br /> It has a good cast. It's great to see Roger Moore back on screen and other British actors. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Maybe she is playing the sexy Maryam D'Abo next to her cousin. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of invisible places like Luxembourg. Hopefully, we will see more British-European co-productions like these.
