A realistic depiction of the young love for a college set, but also for an older audience like me. It has ups and downs, twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see films with black urban characters that could appeal to an older, non-black audience, and show a more realistic portrayal of young adults. <br /> <br /> This movie is set on a college campus and in a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are various friends, acquaintances and situations that influence them better or worse. A typical plot may say some, but that was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I have relied on the survival of the couple's relationship and have seen my own past in their history. Moments of deep thought and revelation spilled out of the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It's a bright movie that I would recommend to young people who are in love or ever in love. Great movie. I will look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
