This may be the only film that actually comes close to filming the essentially unbelievable world of American college experience of the late '60s and early' 70s. Name another movie that even approaches it: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are cartoons. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but this is a retrospective film about (self-possessed) individuals more than a film about a time and a place that is portrayed in this time and place. "Drive, He Said" portrays - with subtlety and nuance where it should be, and a quick kick in the shorts where this is the only appropriate way - the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of the great college sports (especially when there is one) a war against), the sexual revolution of the time and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like this. <br /> <br /> The entire cast deserves recognition (as does the director, of course), but special praise should be given to Bruce Dern as a basketball coach and Karen Black, the hero very unusual - except for that time - loving interest. William Tepper as the lead actor is also a real applause, both for his perfect track record of the then student athlete and for the real college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in Tall Story, Yikes!). <br/> <br /> All in all a classic - and the last movie someone in grade 6 should write ("boring," "dismissive") - um, right, sonny. Please go back to your Arnold films. Why is not this movie on imdb?
