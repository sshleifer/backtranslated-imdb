After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his sick uncle's ranch to take over the daily operations, only to find out that the old man was murdered by his beautiful gold digger wife and the woman's vicious brother. <br /> <br Good production values, a sympathetic performance by Mark Damon and an action packed script make for a fun, if not exceptionally deep, above-average addition to the Western spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European women ever to be on screen. Here she is absolutely perfect as a cold-hearted user (and perpetrator) of weak men. Damon and Neri have appeared in at least one other painting, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie of particular interest to those of you who want to see what's under Rosalas clothes.
