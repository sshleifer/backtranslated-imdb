So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described the guy in the video library the Hardcore logo, he said it sounds like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, because Still Crazy is more focused on a classic rock band than a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the height of its popularity at a major rock festival. Twenty years later, all members of the band fight for their livelihood and it is possible to give a concert for the festival's 20th anniversary. They accept the offer and decide to permanently reform and travel to Europe. Some pretty funny hijinks follow, and all characters undergo subtle changes. When you watch this movie, you feel more like a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
