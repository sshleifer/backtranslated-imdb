Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie's boss Tom Carper, who was governor. That's why the Feds got involved. He called Clinton and asked him to involve the Feds in the case. I was living outside of Philadelphia at that time, so there was news on the front page every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw the City Confidential segment at A & E. Tom Capano was a height man (sp.), An over-controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she did not allow that anymore, he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
