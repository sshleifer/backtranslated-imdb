"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Performers: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn> <br /> MPAA rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content, and some language) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity today gets a biopic about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash: Biopics are very classy right now. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of them to be released on DVD. It shows Gretchen Mol as the most famous pin-up model in the world, Bettie Page, and was mostly filmed in black and white with certain color sections. Unlike "Ray," "Walk the Line," and "Finding Neverland," this film will not be seen at the Oscars this year. This film lacks the emotional resonance shown in other biopics, and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or merely suggested. However, this does not mean that it is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling film - a solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. Filmed with eagerness and diligence, Mary Harrone's directing captures the look and feel of the time most filmmakers dream of. <br /> <br /> Everybody knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an icon or a simple pornstar, you know her. She is a woman who only profoundly influenced American culture by exposing more skin than was found appropriate at the time. Well, most people know it as one of America's first sex symbols - a legend for many models, especially those from Playboy and other adult magazines. She lived at a time when she showed only one inch of meat under the rubbish. Someone could be arrested, and Pages Bondage-like photos were just the thing to rouse the American public. In fact, the photos ushered in a comprehensive Senate investigation into decency and the difference between harmless movies and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances in "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful, with Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance as a Bettie Page is just awesome. I understand that many people were skeptical when she was announced for this role. Her name does not come to mind immediately when I think of great achievements. Now it will. She took full advantage of the role and attracted me with her vulnerable yet deeply captivating performance. David Strathairn is fresh from last year's "Good Night and Good Luck," in which he gave one of the best performances of 2005. Here he still gives a good performance, although he is a little under load. I was shocked by how limited his screen time was, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of a good movie. The only performance I saw of Lili Taylor was in The Haunting (1999). While most people ignored the film, I found the film pleasant, if not superficial horror, and I've always thought that Taylor, as the emotionally disturbed Nell, is totally believable. Here Taylor gives another credible performance. It gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to complement those of Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After all was said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" is not comparable to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is incomparable with these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from beginning to end. Her personal life is briefly hinted at, but it really is her influence on the world that becomes the climax. We watch the movie and know that Page will eventually expose everyone, and we know the impact their decisions will have. But we are seldom shown what effects they will have on their personal lives. She is a woman who never looked back and constantly reinvented herself. After all, she was an adult Christian missionary. This movie is not too dramatic. It could have contained fictitious moments in which Page hysterically sobbed and asked God to forgive her. It could have shown Page that ran through the rain and screaming, trying to escape the ghosts of their past? And yet it does not. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story that is rare in today's world. Luckily, it's pretty refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)
