Rob Roy is an underrated epic of passion and action! SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson is an outstanding performer as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange is perfect as Mrs. Mary. They have the greatest passion and chemistry I have seen in a film couple. John Hurt gives his best redhead aristocrat performance. Tim Roth portrays one of the greatest screen villains. His rape of Mary is abominable and staggering. He is really a great bastard in this movie script and scored, and Michael Caton-Jones's direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
