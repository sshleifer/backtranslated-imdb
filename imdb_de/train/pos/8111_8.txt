Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; an essay on the destructive nature of war and the horrors of progress. It shows some surprisingly accurate accounts of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is extremely naive in its utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson form a good cast. although the drama is played more as a play than as a cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted, speeches that are often thought of as the actor trying to reach the back of the theater. But there are some profound words. Is technology the savior of humanity or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a feast for the eyes, if you can get rid of the age of the effects. Of course, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely so inventive. For the ingenuity, the third act is a treat: a world of underground cities, massive decobombans, space cannons, gyro-helicopters, and secret organizations of scientific saviors. It has all the prerequisites for a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the traps for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> The things that come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of Neolithic Hollywood sci-fi cinema. They are operationally and visually inspiring. The technology has left them behind for a long time, but their ideas were still breaking out. There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer-generated mass cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.
