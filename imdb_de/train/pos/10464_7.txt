For all who do not speak Swedish: The Swedish [original title] of this film; "Rånarna" translates something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with the movie, because it's not really about the robbers. It's about a young woman who works for the Swedish police and investigates robberies. One would think a normal desk job, but this girl is soon out in the field taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers ... Exactly: We've seen that before. The fact that the plot has a pretty interesting twist halfway is not really helpful because the ending is just as cliché as the first two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> What keeps the movie from being just another mainstream movie is the fact that it's masterly executed in every way, that the actors are as great as they are and not too much and that the director really manages to keep it as exciting as it does for most of the story /> <br /> One thing that I really loved about this movie is the fact that the music is the right one Mood makes when needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, giving the shootouts and the scene a nice sense of reality chases throughout the movie. A nice gesture! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often tend to be typographed is detrimental to the film, as you know that he will not only play the heroine's friend and will be a supporting figure in the background. All in all, it's a fun movie that steals more money than time for you. 10.7
