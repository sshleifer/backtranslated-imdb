First, I have to give it to the people who got this thing together. 9/11 is such a delicate matter that making a movie that dares to argue about it requires a lot of courage. It's a shame, if not surprising, that the movie was banned in the US. <br /> <br /> But I think the movie is outstanding with a few weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian part, which reminds a bit of Majid Majidi's work (the absolutely beautiful "heavenly children" and "the color of paradise"). Similar to these two films, the clip shows what happened to the innocent eyes of a class of Afgan refugees in Iran. Absolutely nice clip. The same goes for the clip of Sean Penn, who is also great. But just as some clips are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu makes the Mexican clip and like his good-natured "Amores Perros" he does it as brutally as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen that plays multiple sounds in the background. These sounds are from the reporters and their shock when the second plane crashes, those who have called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, the ones who were angry ... and he combines this with lightning from people jumping from the towers. A very hard clip that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips may be hard to see for Americans, as some clips may be interpreted as "You are not" the only ones who suffer. "Especially the Egyptian and British clips that are not just saying that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US has done to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also mention the clips from Bosnia especially: Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter is terribly wrong It does not really seem that way). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I mention the clip especially of Israel, which in my opinion is extremely weak.The idea was good (a reporter is on a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but its story is exaggerated because of events in New York), which many of us who live in war-torn states can relate to the realization is awful. "The clip ends like a reporter, de At any cost, he gets some airtime, a guy who says he's a witness and hopes he can go on TV and soldiers and paramedics who just shout 'because'. The clip can not capture the drama of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, you should do so unless you are conservative, in which case you ''d rather stay out there, as you might be offended. If you are not, you may find out how many of us outside of the US lived through September 11th.
