The dentist was made at the time when almost every profession had his psychology. We had crazy police, ambulances, secretaries, and that was meant for beginners only. The dentist came surprisingly late, because the visit to the dentist is usually a nightmare for everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. Super Clean Dentist Doctor Feinstone lives a perfect life in his big "white house", he has a beautiful blonde wife and a great job as a dentist. Dark clouds come in the form of evil IRS types (Terminator Earl Boen) to his horizon, dirty pool cleaner "cleans" his wife and suddenly all the teeth seem to have gone through dark filters. He turns on his head and begins to nag people's teeth in a nasty way. And you do not want to come on his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first Film Society was a good spin-off of John Carpenter's They Live. Film producer Pierre David is known from films like Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and the Major League, but I could re-dream him as a psycho-dentist. He was really great in his role and he was kind of sad. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and stupid as Feinstein's wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him with neighborhood ladies, I knew my future job. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, from the hereafter) was a beautiful sight as a police officer in the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager who will come to Feinstone as the next customer. <br /> <br /> Last warning: If you are like me and have a problem with the dentist, you may want to skip this. But if you want to try it out, you should prepare yourself with dark humor and many unpleasant holes.
