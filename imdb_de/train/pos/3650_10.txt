Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I had originally made and copied a VHS cassette of this wonderful TV presentation. I was deeply shattered when I realized what I had done since I could not get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently I subscribed to digital cable and while browsing upcoming movies there surprise was a planned broadcast of the movie. This time, however, I made a copy on DVD, so I can not repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> After eight years, I was finally able to watch it again, and it was as exciting and tense as when I saw it for the first time. There is a bit of foreshadowing this story when my first contact with "Pandora's Clock "came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just happened to stop broadcasting on my way home for lunch, and from the first part I was addicted. Every day I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book was to be televised as a movie on television, I made sure that my book was clarified on schedule for this event. <br /> <br /> First, I would say that the film was very faithful to the book, in contrast to what another reviewer said. This is a rare accomplishment for television films. Secondly, I agree with others on the casting. I could not think of a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. The film literally crashed and could have burned without a true cast for this key role. Anderson has never been better and it is a shame we did not see him again. In fact, all the actors have done an excellent job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film - and the book - was the intervention of the "terrorist conspiracy" with which a private business jet was to be armed with air-to-air missiles and stalk and shoot their pilots down the affected plane. Basically, we're talking less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this and the people that are simply not realistic among all the actors involved. It was also unrealistic how little the aircraft was affected by the first and second engines. <br /> <br /> Apart from this beef, I enjoyed the suspension of the building and found very believable how the reactions are from. In the movie were presented foreign governments as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, definitely do so.
