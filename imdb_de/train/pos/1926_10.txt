In 1967, I visited Lake Elsinore and flew a yellow Pratt Read glider. Returning to Germany, the above serious ran on TV and one segment dealt with the highs in California in the early 50s. (The real pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played him in the series.) It turned out that the glider in the movie was the same (the same N-number) as the one I flew in Lake Elsinore , Since I've seen this segment, I've searched for it and wondered if it's available anywhere. (other segments in this area included the Baker Eject-Seat, a tool to find avalanche victims, etc.)
