From what I read, many people were disappointed with this movie compared to Part 1. At first I could understand that, but after thinking for a while, I think they are wrong. Soderbergh goes on to report facts based on Che's life, which he began in Part 1. Part 1 spoke of a revolution that developed from unpromising beginnings to ultimately successful completion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that develops from unsophisticated beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Ches life had completely different results. He bravely decides to tell both in a very simple way. The viewer may come out of the cinema much better than Part 2 after Part 1, but that's the reality of Che's life and in my opinion no mistake of the director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war, as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can not take a break and their numbers are constantly reduced by death and capture. Ches capture and death are treated well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as a charismatic Argentinean again. So if you saw Part 1, Part 2 will tell you a very similar story of a very different story.
