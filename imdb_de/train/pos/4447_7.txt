Barbara Stanwyck gives this early, led by Douglas Sirk, produced by Universal soap just the kick she needs. Not so memorable as the later melodramas of Sirk. It is easy to see when you see "All I Desire", where Sirk would be artistic in the years to come. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to his family in Smalltown, USA, after leaving her a decade earlier. Her family and community have mixed feelings about her shocking return. Some of the cinematographs are amazing, and Stanwyck is tough and really gives this movie a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
