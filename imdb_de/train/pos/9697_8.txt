This is a really heartwarming family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "actors" (if you can call it that) (just think of the dog in "How the Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was just bad training). The Paulie story is very well done, well reproduced, and in general the characters are really well made. Not to say, except that this is a BIG FILM! <br /> <br /> My Ratings: Story 8.5 / 10, Spectacle 7.5 / 10, Animals + FX 8.5 / 10, Cinematography 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT FAMILY FILM AND VERY WORTH WATCHING!
