There is not much going on in this story - just two men using very different ways of dealing with Vietnam memories. But what he lacks in premise more than makes up for it in acting and realism. It's a quiet movie about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We even get romance (not for nothing - just another very real piece of this story). It is very worth seeing.
