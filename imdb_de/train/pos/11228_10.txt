That's short and to the point. The story writing for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting is everywhere on the map, but the main characters seem to have worked over the years to improve their abilities. It is hard to believe that this series has been running for almost seven years and will end in mid-May 2007. I will not repeat what has already been said about the sets and the graphics. Considering that this is all volunteer, no gain, that's pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If this was rated as a professional production, I would have a 5 for a good story, but terrific sets. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give a very good rating, as some other efforts are an exception, as this is a separate league. I do not think that's right for the volume. Congratulations to the performers and the crew for one of many admired achievements.
