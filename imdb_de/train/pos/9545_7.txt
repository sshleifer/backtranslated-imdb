I do not know if I should recommend this movie to the fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Some things about this movie can easily be called a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, the editing is equally hectic and fast - which is good, because the film is not only more dynamic, but also some deficiencies, which are caused by a low budget and other factors, is hidden. <br /> <br /> There's a lot more Gore Less eroticism and in the case of "Meatball Machine" is the transformation of humans into a creature that is partly a machine (sounds familiar?) known as "Necroborg" (very original), through slimy little aliens. <br /> <br /> These slimy little scraps from outer space actually use humans as vessels for their gladiator games they play with each other. They infest the body, somehow pulling in a crazy set of mechanical parts that seemingly pulls them out of nowhere and turns them into a killing machine that attacks other Necroborgs. Your goal is to defeat another alien, who is in another Necroborg, to tear it out of the body and eat. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot sounds a little stupid and I did not expect much In the end, I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a low budget movie, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect much from actors, they are usually not very good, but it can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the gore, certain bizarre situations and the way the film is judged and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm - for me at least. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points.
