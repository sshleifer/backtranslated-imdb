The main aspect of this movie that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people have seen this movie and just do not understand it, and I do not understand why. As I watched this movie, I was taken on a private trip that took me off balance. I'll try to explain this without a spoiler, but be warned, I'll talk about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** Be warned! **** <br /> <br /> Being is a life with "big moves" versus "little moves". He selects Natalia as his queen, and he and she behave when his aunt described the king and queen and their steps as she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks a question, he fades into the past as if he were reviewing past steps. (The flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way.) The flashbacks are also very interesting, because they not only reflect his point of view as a child, but also the point of view of the other character. It's breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Different characters become either his helpers or his enemies, farmers, bishops and knights. Your actions will show you which side they are on. Even their placement in a scene is crucial to understanding what's going on. Nicely done. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to comment on what's going on with the character of Luhzin, but I hope that it sheds some light on what actually happens in the end, works on many levels, which is why I support it. It was a pleasure and a pleasure to see it. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is to use chess and the characters that are treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
