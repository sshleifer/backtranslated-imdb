Sporting films have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are those who focus less on the sport than on the character, like Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama and a great premiere for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and involved, that's enough to turn it into a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost straight forward. Diana Guzman is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her election campaigns in the corridor, she is about to be expelled. As a way to unleash her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother trains (at her father's request). In the course of ninety minutes we have the audience See something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it both in her body and in her behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club feels attracted to her and she gets involved. There is no bad scene or lame / invented moment in the movie. The only mistake I could say could be corrected is that one of the negotiations ends on an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
