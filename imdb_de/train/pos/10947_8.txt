The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's own stand-up; It's so exaggerated with prejudice that you can not take it to heart. However, the fact is that most people will "get it," but not that they will all appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can give up there as well. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned because every episode has been as good as the last. <br /> <br /> Like all shows, she is not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some big mistakes. Racist songs are fun, but they get older much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I also had with "Jesus is Magic." It seems that Silverman has quoted a quota of songs for each episode that does not have to exist. Not to mention that the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, but the music is not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that for some reason this show will appeal to fans of Monty Python, Upright Citizens Brigade, etc. it's not like these shows. I can see Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can not see more than half an hour at a time. It is going flat very fast. The replay value for this show is also low - the second time around an episode is pretty funny and the third time I think it's boring. <br /> <br /> The first time, however, is very long, very funny. Try it once.
