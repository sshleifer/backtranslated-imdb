While Eddie Murphy's getting up, a woman in the audience screams at Eddie and a man in the audience answers. What is said is "Women - DO MR ROB" (this is a character from Saturday night live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. In contrast to the previous post, which says that the women screamed gumby, this is wrong, although the post-he said he was there, they would have a hearing problem! Despite what the post-he says about the non-existence here on DVD, you can listen carefully, because you can actually hear it on the DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope that helps anyone who is curious about the outbreak. !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
