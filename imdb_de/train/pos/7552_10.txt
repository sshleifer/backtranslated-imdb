CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the Best Short Film Award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and won the Excellence Prize at the Japanese Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the little kitten Nyaako's soul is stolen by death, she and she, Brother Nyatta, embark on a bizarre journey to get it back. In the surreal dream landscape of the Other Side they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime you have never seen before. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, breathtakingly beautiful and has a strong sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody. So it's more of an anime for adults than kids (who can not understand it at all!). A great trip for those who have the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. A must!
