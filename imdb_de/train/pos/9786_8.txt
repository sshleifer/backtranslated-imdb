I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances in which the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with the change between the epochs. I also appreciated the underlying story in which the unions lost power and the effect of a big employer that closed a small town. I do not agree with the remark that the older man has to be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the man looking good. The depth of the character can not be so flat for them. The movie looks good and the cinematography is good too.
