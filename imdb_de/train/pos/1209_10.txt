In a time of horrible cartoons, I am rather shocked to see a movie with such good manners that it is included in the IMDB bottom list for animated films. I will not deny that. However, when I was in the target age group for this movie, I did not even notice it, and it would not have mattered if I did. The people who did it may have used "New Generation" to realize that this was another way the Care Bear family could have started. Maybe we should decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie, ages 3-6, and it did not scare or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
