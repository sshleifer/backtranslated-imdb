Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), who is based on a true story and tells about an Australian woman, is accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo has taken her baby, but the story is extremely suspicious. The film is about the media circus about the case, the interpretation of the Australian media presented in the media and the mentality of the lynch mob, which ultimately led to the woman's conviction based on barely hard evidence. I love films that challenge the media, as well as films that take a close look at how people are kept in check by the judiciary. I've always thought that Jurys 12 Angry Men should be shown before they fulfill their duties. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we as humans interpret events based on our prejudices and desire for revenge. A scream in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi takes care not to make the film melodramatic at all. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it captivating.
