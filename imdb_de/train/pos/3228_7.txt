David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds funny to you then you're right, because that's right. The value of life, etc. He covered these topics in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his scripts, there is something in that direction. Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly, all his other films have! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The script of the people is clearly visible in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically modified soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, stays on a planet and is dead. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay, others hate him and there are an interesting drama here. BUT THEN ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers come to the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all humans. Big, violent, loud action follows, and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson Action Festival. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better than I expected. Entertaining, somewhat, albeit not very, thought-provoking and exciting as the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
