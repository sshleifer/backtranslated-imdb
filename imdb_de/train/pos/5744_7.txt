That was at about two o'clock in the morning. On Saturday morning a few years ago, for various reasons, I did not remember the entire story, but the two outstanding achievements of the central characters remain. Dom had an unfortunate crowd, manipulated and literally a garbage job. Eugene was torn between personal aspirations and duty to his sibling. Tom Hulce's dome does not ask for sympathy - it comes by itself. Ray Liotta is a universe near Henry Hill that has a soft center. In an ungrateful position. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is the dilemma many young carers have - the past or the future. As it turns out, the two can happily coexist with some work. Thoughtfully handled & perceptive Dominick & Eugene is hard to warm.
