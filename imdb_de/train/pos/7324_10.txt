My personal favorite horror movie. From the long first tracking shot to the last story, this is the masterpiece of Carpenter. <br /> <br /> Halloween night 1963, the little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve of 1978 Michael flees from the sanatorium of Smith's Grove. Michael came home on Halloween night to assassinate again. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely simple: Michael steals and kills babysitting. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost overpowering atmosphere of fear that creates the tension. As with any great horror movie, events are telegraphed long in advance, but they still seem to be random, so the audience never has a chance to guess the movie - camera shots and, above all, this damn scary music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes, I have not seen in the movie yet. There is a body count, but it is relatively small compared to the other slashers. That and most murders are almost bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in ignorance. <br /> <br /> The acting is all around good. PJ Soles provides most of the movies with limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis shows a decent performance and then there is the young (then) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her appearance seems shy and insecure at first glance, but you quickly realize that she is perfect for the character, who is shy and insecure herself and not at all prepared for what she expects. And of course there is the perfectly staffed Donald Pleasence as the determined (maybe a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a disadvantageous error, that would be the passage of time. Since the release of this movie so many years ago, there have been countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators, stealing (mostly badly) the best pieces of the movie until almost everything is known. Coupled with the changes in audience expectations and appetite, most of the films are watering down raw power. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be considered as it once was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> Still, I can not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie is scary time. Highest provisions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
