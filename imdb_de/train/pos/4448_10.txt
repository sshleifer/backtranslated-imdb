I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and I really liked it. I am a student of script writing and I loved how the little characters intervened when something crucial / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue very sharp and the premise of the story is quite shocking - at one point Barbara Stanwyck flirts openly with her daughter's boyfriend; AND to revive some passion for her husband, whom she has not seen in ten years; And with the shooting signal 'two shots and then one' she joins in with her old Shag-Mate Dutchman (the reason she left the city at all!). The moral majority must have been totally embittered when they saw this movie in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Love the costumes and cinematography and direct conversation from the hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and co at 'Bunny' Hug 'is a good reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of this time, which I have seen for a long time.
