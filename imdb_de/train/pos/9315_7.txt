Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon makes a proxy murder case, acquires an acquittal, and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but part of a blackmail ring that reaches to the city's highest stadiums. Accused of his own complicity, he conducts an investigation, stumbles upon the identity of the "unknown man" who leads the syndicate, and murders it. <br /> <br /> The ironies intervene when Braselle has accused this second murder and murder Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Although there is some urban grit and lacking in rhetoric, the unknown man belongs less to the style of the Noir cycle than to his recognition of the ubiquitous corruption of American urban politics that emerged in the post-war years.
