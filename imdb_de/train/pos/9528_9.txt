Frankly, this film has overcome most of its critics. <br /> <br /> The opposite of damnation (lost) is salvation (saved) and this movie is one of the very few that deal with two concepts. The film also examines the love and disappointment that comes with the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the beginning that none of these topics are currently fashionable topics. <br /> <br /> The premise is that the fathers are on the move, hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his criminal boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) love their sons and will do anything to protect them , But Rooney's son Connor is even worse than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his father's theft. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael has become a witness, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) to silence witnesses. Sullivan decides that he wants revenge at any cost, even at the terribly high price price of the offense. Rooney, who cursed the day Connor was born in one scene, refuses to give his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney goes with his son Connor on the road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, Sullivan Connor Rooney follows the road to Perdition and Maguire tracks Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement cellar and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says, "Michael, there are only killers in this room ... and there is only one guarantee that none of us can see it will be heaven. " Somewhat predictably, the film is over, a character is saved and a character repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he steps out of the character to convincingly play Hitman Sullivan. a subtle and laconic performance. Newman is doing well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, who shows a hard edge in his face and manner, and his eyes are followed by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire accordingly scary. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affects. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was constantly casting light from the darkness, reflecting the themes of salvation and corruption. The camera drew from a palette of shades of green and gray. The shades of gray belonged to the fathers and cityscapes of the Illinois of depression. The greens belonged to the younger sons and the rural plains of this state. Thomas Newman's luscious, sonorous and haunting music had weak Irish overtones and was played in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic urban factories, churches in the Midwest. The houses shone with shiny woodwork. <br /> <br /> The film's outstanding achievement is to create a unique feeling from its profound themes, unmistakable drama and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a light anti-gun message that was included in the script. The film is only to listen to political correctness. I give this movie an A10 out of 10; Over time, it is recognized as a great movie.
