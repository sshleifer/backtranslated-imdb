Richard Dreyfuss plays in "Moon Over Parador," a 1988 Paul Mazursky movie starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters, and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make a movie. When the dictator suddenly dies, the head of the secret police (Julia), who actually controls the dictator and the country, prefers Jonathan to play the dictator, having established the similarity between them. Jonathan is soon being held in the palace as Alphonse Simms, and Simms' prostitute friend Madonna (Braga), who realizes the change, promises to help him in every possible way. Mazursky, who appears as Simms on the train 'Mother, gives us a look at how the CIA works in Third World countries. The Winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA employee. The film flirts with it, but is not really on very serious ground and is more of a program and a funny thing. Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job as Jonathan the actor and Alphonse, the dictator, create two separate characters and nail them together. The beautiful Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia gives a wickedly funny performance as Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It's one of those performances where you never know exactly what the character thinks - he can always be comfortable or psycho. Charo is on duty as a maid and at the same time she is funny and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.
