I have been a fan of this movie for years. As Teri Hatchers comes to the fore, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch it. Why did not people in 1991 see how wonderful this movie was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are just fantastic. Although I have never seen soap operas during the day, this film kills me every time I see it. Acting is unsurpassed for a comedy and writing is so smart. I strongly recommend that you look at this, if you have not already done so. You'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher, just to name a few.
