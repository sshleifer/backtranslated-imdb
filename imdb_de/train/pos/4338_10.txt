The movie was very moving. It was tender and funny at the same time. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning services. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand from the plot that her role had to be short, but I wish I could have seen more of her - she is a true professional. You will be able to recall experiences from your own life, hopefully see this movie in a positive way. We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser after a Q & A visit. He is a wonderful man, smart, eloquent and a "real person". It was really a nice evening! This is a movie you must have seen. You will be so thankful that you left.
