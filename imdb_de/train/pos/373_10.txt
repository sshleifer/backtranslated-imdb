This movie is such a moving, amazing work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and did not really "understand" it. Steven Spielberg made a wonderful movie that gets you under control from start to finish. I also read the book, but there is something that really brings the movie to life. the casting, drama, music, costumes, scenery, everything, it's just wonderful. They laugh, they cry, they cheer ... it brings forth every imaginable emotion. It is one of his finest works and should not be missed!
