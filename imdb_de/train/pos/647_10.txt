Well, of course not, women are on average hypersensitive and needy, which is interesting from mother to whore, if not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or blatant. Unlike many of you, I only saw La Maman and La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I've found that my opinion has improved a second look. All I know is what I've seen and still needs to dive into more exploits until I buy the DVD myself. I do not have to figure out exactly why I like this movie, but what interests me, why? However, I am sure that I could and will make a wonderful statement. Okay, so you can not agree with that, maybe it's boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a beautiful Grushenka.
