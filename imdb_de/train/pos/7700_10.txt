This was one of those 50-cent deals of yesteryear - and far more complex than most - and it was in color! The effects are not only extraordinary, unlike crap like "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" - the true "killer" is the "universality of the conspiracy" - it all depends on two principles - the ancient concept of a hidden, incestuous thinking father Desire for his daughter, and the idea of ​​what would happen, should a technician of the world reach the point where all the wishes of the citizen manifest. <br /> <br /> Not many, if any - and this has become the fate of the population of the "forbidden" planet - actually rather modern. Unfortunately, the "gang" of "The Krell", which is wasted by ignorance, and "Morpheus," the incestuous father, knows how to access such technique - and does so to prevent his daughter from becoming one another is lost. ancient property, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> and given its age, it remains a breathtaking thrill, action, a classic for human emotions - and visually very modern - do not miss these - it says all modern sci-fi --- and its pscychological content takes it beyond any genre --- a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and the soundtract! You will not see / hear a pure "synth" and perfectly tuned Moog background - a "do not miss" ---
