Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes unexpectedly to his son. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), has left his father's wife. His three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father are visiting a farmhouse for sale stands. But that's not the end of her journey. Your road trip will be a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script and has done a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just incredible. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so it's no wonder it's so good. Who better to play father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you that. And I love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the role. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter made me go fishing in this movie for sure. And how the old man defeated the younger in the billiard game and then defeated him with the stick. The movie is often very funny and I had to laugh several times. But it can also come from time to time. You can not tell a story better than it is told here.
