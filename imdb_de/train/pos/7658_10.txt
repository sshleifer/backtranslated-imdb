<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But not lately. In my memory, never to leave me, is a scene where Mickey Rooney, "Killer Mears," knows he should be executed, and it approaches the moment of truth. He dances and cries and laughs, he swings from hesteria to euphoria and operates the gambit of eternal emotions. I've never seen such a brilliant performance by a living or deceased actor. Then I knew for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes "Andy Hardy", was and is an actor of great genius. However, I have kept it, thinking of my opinion for years. Certainly I have to be alone in this position. About 15 years after seeing this movie on TV for the last time, I read the old Los Angeles Times Q & A section. The question was asked to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was, "Mr. Olivier You are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who would you consider to be one of the greatest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned but not surprised. I immediately flashed back to his "Killer Mears". I felt very good because I had seen this great ability in him and now supported my view of another whose work I admired moments with Mikey Rooney. This film "The Last Mile" should be seen by all the actors. I honestly can not remember much about the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me. If someone out there remembers this movie, just like me? I would like to hear from you. For this image, which is engraved in my heart alone, I gave it only at first glance of his performance.
