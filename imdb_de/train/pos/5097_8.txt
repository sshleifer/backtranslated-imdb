This is a very rare film and probably the least-known film by Shirley Temple, as it is not featured in any of its collections. The reason for this is probably that unlike all his other films, he does not have a happy ending, even though she released a song called "The world owes me a life." The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and on VHS I would say that they did a good job, because the color looks realistic. Unlike me, Laurel And Hardy's color films are awful. The movie is good for its age and the story is not old yet, I'm surprised no one has tried Make a remake. Sometimes the movie is a bit too talkative, as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard really seem undressed. In some scenes, they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five. Do not be put off, because this movie has really good moments, especially when {Jerry} Ga yy Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and slow accumulation of his actions while his daughter sings to an audience in another room at the same time is very well directed. Gary and Caroles are nervous facial expressions, if they are scrutinized, are also very good. All in all, this is a good movie from the early 30's, accept it for its age.
