ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I would not rate it as classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra performed together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two Hollywood vacationers on leave, who make friends with a young boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson), a fighting actress who works at MGM as an extra , Although both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually makes a fondness for Joe, but Clarence later meets with a waitress (Pamela Britton), whom he learns from his hometown of Brooklyn. The paper-thin storyline leaves room for some great musical numbers, including "We hate leaving", Joe and Clarence complain their fellow sailors as they leave the ship. Grayson's crisp rendition of "Blinds"; Sinatra's dreamy interpretation of "I fall in love too easily" (a number that is unfortunately deleted from some of the film's prints) and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly makes with the animated Jerry the Mouse by Tom and Jerry , Kelly also makes a kind of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet, which is equivalent to his pirate ballet in later THE PIRATE. Kelly is in great shape here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and Sinatra's lovable shy character is undeniably sexy. An entertaining change for fans of the MGM music factory.
