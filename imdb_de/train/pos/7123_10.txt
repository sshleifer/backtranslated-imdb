Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed by it? and yet it is not easy to explain why I liked it so much. This applies mainly to the unusual films? Those you can barely compare with the rest. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special films. There are a lot of emotions in this movie? and the drama was so good that, as I watched the movie, I cried and laughed as the story went on. The young Nick Robinson? is a small boy (William), who was evacuated from London because of the air raids during the Second World War. Mr. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man who goes to the village where the evacuated children were sent. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refuses to take on any responsibilities - such as caring for a troubled young lad? but accepts, since he has no choice. During the stay, Mr. Tom discovers how terrible life was for William? his mother sent a belt and written instructions to her son's host next to the baggage? do not hesitate to use it. This belt is brewed in the field? never be used so brutally. Mr. Tom is a real home for William and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly a letter that William was called home in London, saying that she is not feeling well, and it starts all over again? only this time it will be much worse ?? There are many feelings you can feel in this movie? Love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema that is comparable only to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot. if you compare. I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. Before concluding this report, I would like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac. reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood (:
