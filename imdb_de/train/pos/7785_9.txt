I've just watched two films from Pang Brothers, The Eye and One Take. When I saw The Eye, I was kind of disappointed with those two guys, of whom I had heard good words before. This movie (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially the ending (childish, clich√©d and, in my opinion, too random), but it's still good at photography and in experimental imagery. So I decided to just see One and I was not disappointed anymore. Still great photography, stunning image, cut in MTV style, cool music and this time the story has a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful. You will see some small action holes that will not cause any problems. Action The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
