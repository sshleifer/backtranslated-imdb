The shooting is pleasant and the environment is very realistic. I liked that he boldly took up ideas of the many difficult moral and social moraines of mainland China in the 1930s, as well as more basic human issues - I felt I could get a real sense of time, even in great shots of traditional Chinese theater and in puristic depictions of street life. It seemed worthwhile to experience it. The intertwined role that Buddhism plays is probably the most appropriate form, both in its base and its philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective I have seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Pictures are unforgettable. Action is solid enough. Thematically pueril, yet rich enough to complement the expression of his expression.
