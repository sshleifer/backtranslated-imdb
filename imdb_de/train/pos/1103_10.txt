This movie has some of the best comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever written in a movie! The plot is missing something, but the delightful jokes make the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages, which will surely please. As a cinematic art form, it is highly entertaining; and with big stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how can you be wrong? <br /> <br /> Comedy dialogues and timelines like these have long been undervalued and are very hard to imitate. A good example of this is 1986's knockoff: The Money Pit with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged on bad reviews and comments from viewers. A true comedic dialogue is an art.
