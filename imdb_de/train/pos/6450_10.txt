This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It puts me on a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and become disgusted and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! Of course, I have to mention lead actor Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays goals that so convincingly plays this mentally challenged young man! He somehow reminded me of the role of Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend this song to everyone to see and enjoy!
