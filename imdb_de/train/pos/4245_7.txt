If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar they should do it. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow accepts all kinds of jewelry from men of the medium. <br /> <br /> And these are men looking for Jean Harlow. She leaves the house on the side of the road, run by her mother and stepfather, because she has decided to win the simplest life for her when she marries her. Her talents as a choral girl are limited, but she will be able to act with this beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins with her and her friend Patsy Kelly receiving an invitation to a million-dollar party throwing Lewis Stone. But without knowing Jean, Stone has only one wild last move before he does himself, because he has the money he does not own. Nevertheless, she wrestles him a few bullets that noticed the millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel is having fun until Jean targets his playboy son Franchot Tone. After that, he is not amused and he wants to shake off Jean, to climb the pedigree. <br /> <br /> The Missouri girl went into production in the middle of The Code, so it was under a special censorship. I feel like we've seen a much riskier movie. Jean Harlow is still valued as a younger and sweeter version of Mae West. What a great comic talent this woman had when she saw The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the movie's world had to endure with her death three years later Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful shorts, which Kelly made with Thelma Todd, another famous platinum blonde. Harlow and Kelly have the same simple chemistry between Patsy and Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in an unusual accident / suicide / murder, without ever being given a satisfactory explanation. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the Missouri girl, it's bright and cheeky and must be of all that sparkling jewelry.
