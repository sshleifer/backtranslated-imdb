Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: A businessman is blackmailed by three criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job as a lead actor and special recognition must go to John Glover, who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I have to mention that the villains are very complex and interesting - which is very rare for an action movie. There are also some beautiful and sexy women - most notably Kelly Preston as the young pursuer of Schieder. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is associated with the three blackmailers. I am happy to say that Ann-Margaret has still not lost it - this lady is a true baby. Do not look at the speed of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore it and watch this really gripping and undervalued movie. You will enjoy it, that is a promise. Recommended A +.
