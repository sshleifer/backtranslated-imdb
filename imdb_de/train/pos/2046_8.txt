While the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is more important in the US today than ever before. In addition to the workers in the professional occupations, the jobs of all are outsourced by US companies, while the government profits and the Americans suffer. Peter Strauss is Emory, a steelworker who does the same work as his father for 35 years. His wife is portrayed by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic and tries to support the family with two children when Emory loses his job. The mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there are also embezzlement and cheaper wages, where they can pay a steel worker in a month (outsourcing), which they would have to pay Strauss / Emory on one day. Do not forget that these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try the best for their family. John Goodman, Gary Cole (brother of Strauss) and several other colleagues are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes his local union can reopen the mill as she promises. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There are no more jobs in the Rust Belt (Ohio) and they need to move on. But where in the US can they move? Where is it better for a steel worker with a steel worker? <br /> <br /> At the end, there is a triumphant scene in which Emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard allows them to do this as a last gesture, one of the men has committed suicide and he has empathy. All in all a good message movie about hard times here in America. Something that only a few are interested in until it is personally affected. 8.10.
