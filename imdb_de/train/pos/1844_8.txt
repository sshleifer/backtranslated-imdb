I was not sure if this would just be another of those idiotic night soap operas that seem to upset the prime time, but as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (not least thanks to talented casting). Four friends from different backgrounds come together and share the weekly bustle of their love life. The hours-long program follows each of them separately through their often messed-up quests to find love, without being boring or banal. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is the housewife (supposedly widowed after 9/11) who talks with her friends (who tend to be a bit more relaxed and creative, a bit preaching and annoying). It's great, Small on t.v. because she was great in the "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The chick can work. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged but still very likeable of the women as she wrestles with her benevolent but selfish husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") in his craving for a bet Child with her, regardless of her needs. The last two members of the cast are the bubbly Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner, a wild child who sleeps with each and every one, gender non-specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish), a gloomy doctor who has an affair with a patient AND has His son got her career and love life out of control. That being said, I am addicted now and I hope the BBC will continue this series because it is good, different and has a great cast.
