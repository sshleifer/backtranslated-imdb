Terry Gilliam traveled again into the future (he had already done so in "Brazil") to tell this story of a virus destroying humanity. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some simple tricks But it's pretty entertaining and Gilliam proves that he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the gorgeous Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her?) All right, but Brad Pitt is so annoying. Whenever he plays roles that he does not have in his hand, he is so coercive and believable. He should only play good-looking, successful young men. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
