Neither the total catastrophe claimed by the British critics, nor the misunderstood masterpiece on which his few fanboys insist, Revolver is at least an admirable effort by Guy Ritchie to add substance to his Conman caprices. But nothing is more despised than an ambitious movie that bites off more than it can chew, especially when using the gangster / con-artist movie frame. As you would expect from Luc Besson's name as producer, there is a definite element of the "Cinema de look": in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great and has some great edited and designed action sequences and style exude this style as available entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than just upgrade his own movies for a quick buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe, and everything else. If anything is the problem that he is trying to introduce too many influences (something Machiavelli, a shot of Godard, many principles of chess), motives and techniques to contaminate the screen with quotes: the movie was supposed to be just so end with three minutes Epigram about photos of mob victims' bodies, and sometimes it feels like he's never read a fortune cookie he did not want to make a movie of. It is not a commercial of cabalism, but rather a mix of overlapping trading, chess and self - confidence principles that emphasizes the trick that theosophy makes accessible, while simultaneously addressing the central (somewhat metaphysical) conflict of the Films hidden. <br /> <br /> The last third is where most problems can be found, as Jason Statham attacks the enemy (literally) inside with a lot of ambitious, but not always complete crosscutting within the framework, around the outside bream of humans to contrast their inner fear and anger, but it has much to offer. It's not worth starting a new religion from scratch, but I'm surprised it does not have a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?
