I think it's so amazing that we still talk about this movie after all these years! Obviously this movie was not that bad, otherwise people would not even talk to BOTHER about it. Personally, I really enjoyed this movie and I still do it! I think this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly has touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for the people who think this film is "overrated" or "hacked" ... well, we just have to thank the cinema audience for it! lol * You see, it's not CRITICS / article authors making a movie "HUGE" or "HIT" with the general public. PEOPLE make the film a great success. Everyone was impressed with the Titanic. Let's face it, a movie like this has never been done before. At least not with the kind of special effects that are required to really capture the essence of the sinking ship. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron, on that fateful day in April 1912, timed the actual sinking of the ship with the REAL. Even the cutlery for the good fits together! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break! The critics were of the opinion that this movie would lose a lot of time! When this movie actually came out and the people of WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of commercials) began to hear that this was a good / decent / worth watching movie, everyone was flocking to the theaters to see this movie. .. not once, not twice, but maybe three times and more! Well, I really would not say this movie was "overhyped" ... at least not like the build up for the MATRIX reload or the HULK "overhypten". Ha! Critics did not even believe that the Titanic would make enough money to cover the gigantic film budget of Cameron needed to make that mammoth film. However, the film money made for the 200-million budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> I personally love this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say that this movie is just because of the romance shit! This is the sexiest thing I have ever heard! Do not like a movie just because it has romance! The story was cute. The dialogue could have been better, but let's be honest ... the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC Ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, have done a good job. It's not her best work (I've seen much BETTER work of both), but it was not the BADEST I've seen on the screen. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
