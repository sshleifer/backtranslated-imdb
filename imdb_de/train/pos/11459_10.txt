On the one hand, this movie can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sand castles and throw stuff in the air just to see it fall again. At a deeper level, however, it explores the profound desire to reconnect with the country. I deeply agreed with the artist when he said, "If I'm not here for a long time alone, I feel un-rooted." , I'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a few art gallery installations. But seeing his work in motion, perfectly captured by Riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. Frozen in time, Goldsworthy's creations come to life, whirl, fly, dissolve, disintegrate, collapse. <br /> <br /> And that's what he's about: time. The process of creation and destruction. Emergence and disappearance. To come out of nowhere and become the universe and back again. There is a shamanic quality about him that borders on insanity. They feel like watching him at work, that his art is a life force for him, that if he did not, he would go there and perish. Share his vision through the medium of communication photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few stone men and walls, they would only exist for one person.
