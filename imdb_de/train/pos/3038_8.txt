Since Douglas MacArthur influenced more lives for the better than any other Americans who were not elected to the presidency, he earned a better biopic. Not that Universal "MacArthur" is bad. It's just not all it should have been. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the potential was there. Director Joseph Sargent has from the very early "Star Trek" -Pisode "The Corbomite manoeuver" (1966) to the recent HBO film "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5) who was one The most important of these expresses human directors in the film, a man who is able to subtly shape the emotional shading of his performers and bring the audience exactly where they want them to go. Producer Frank McCarthy also gave us "Patton" (197o), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films and Universal announced the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production". However, for all of this, "MacArthur" is quite enough and not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in early 1942, just before the besieged General was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) flees from the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, the film leaves out: <br /> <br /> · MacArthur's birth in 188 O in a border barracks in Arkansas, which is still subject to attack Indians, thereby determining that his remarkable life included the distance of a bow and arrow to thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · graduated from West Point - first in a class of 95, <br /> <br /> as he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the Medal of Honor) Missionary Ridge in Civil War) on assignments in Japan, China and especially the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · his heroic successes on the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> jumping like a mountain goat through the trenches of World War I, often wounded and promoted to brigadier at dazzling speed; <br /> <br /> · His postwar service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the court martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · its routing the bonus Marchers in 1932; His efforts to maintain a poorly underfinanced army as Chief of Staff in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> · His resignation from the US Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Philippine Army; <br /> <br /> and the reactivation of his order by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All this is omitted in favor of a longer movie recording of MacArthur's attempt at seasickness while being evacuated with a PT boat? therefore, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; We also can not understand why the allegations of cowardice "Dugout Doug" were so wounded and so obviously unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is straightforward at the moment: his island hopping "Hit'em wo." You are not a "campaign", the fulfillment of his promise to the Filipinos? "I will turn back!"? His crowning achievement, winning the peace in post-war Japan, the disagreement with President Harry Truman (a rather lively Ed Flanders) over the course of the Korean conflict, which led to his direct fire and finally his proclamation to Congress that "old soldiers just disappear ", after which he did just that. Everything quite historically correct and presented with a very deliberate lack of comments. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers distance themselves painfully them to decorate the historical record with their own agreement or disagreement: If MacArthur's actions appear noble, let them be represented as such; If they appear selfish or bombastic, let them register without comment. Since Joe Sargent is very adept at subtly manipulating his audience's reactions, see Warm Springs, this refusal to comment makes sense. It may be praiseworthy historically, but it almost eliminates the viewer's effort to put this extraordinary man in some kind of rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally there is a kind of "cheap made". feel about the movie, as there is to "Midway", released around the same time. Both films were banished to "television directors" - Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on "Midway" and both have a TV look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march is missing, even though it is quite suitable, the subtle undertones and the size of its "Patton" theme - just another way in which a larger than life man is called by an ordinary movie in memory. There was indisputable vanity and pettiness in this man; there was also greatness? and love or detest him, it must be acknowledged that MacArthur did what no military commander had done before him: he won peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" Like so many biopics, it is a good place to begin exploring this remarkable man, but it is a bad place to end it.
