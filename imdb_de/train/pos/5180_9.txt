There is this private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has been around since 1959. My grandparents were among their founders, my parents had a location from 1965, and my two brothers now have locations there. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing directly to do with the movie.) I'm with myself.I spent the summers of Blueberry Hill when I was five years old until I was eighteen, and it's for the people Like me, who this film is talking to: Those who were a group camp in the forest, as my fiancée says of me, "the good and happy place." If you have never experienced the lifestyle, the Indian Summer will probably be for you It's not fast, it has no quick cuts, the acts are not at all muddled, it has no explosions, such dramatic tensions are mild, there are no A-list actors, no lightening jokes, just um to show how clever the scriptwriters are (apart from Kimberley Williams' killer line that her fiancé should not overpower his toys.) In this movie, it's not about anything at all, The Godfather is a Slasher movie just because he's up for much de m screen has. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is godfather godfather. If you have experienced the lifestyle, watch this movie Read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
