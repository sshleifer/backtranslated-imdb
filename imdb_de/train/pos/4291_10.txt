From the opening credits of the lead actor, we get an early insight into the lives of many men in women and the humor that comes with it in the everyday life of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the director, picks up on how many European men feel they have complete control of their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them, it does not seem to work. The use of facial images throughout the film is superb, and his skillful positioning of the older family member (the mother) is just right. <br /> <br /> Although there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it still deals with single parent / adoptions and the family's strength in the society. Really worthwhile, and again one that can only be done by the French. <br /> <br /> So far one of the top 50 movies I've seen this year and a rating of five points. I'm looking forward to adding this DVD to the DVD collection after its release and recommending it to all ages.
