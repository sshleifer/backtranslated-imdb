In this film, we have the fantastic opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not screened - which is a lot! This movie even goes back to before Simba and (presumably) shortly after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 Elsewhere)" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or sequel, if you choose). ). A bunch of surprises and joy await you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a movie in the cinema (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa are having a fight over what "The Lion King" is about. "They'll start watching as Timon plays the role wants to go when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to return to the beginning, they have a very fair compromise when they watch the movie of their own story, what is expected ... It starts with Timon's first home ... <br / > <br /> For all those who have a good sense of humor first films of almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
