<br /> <br /> Everything is relative and seems from the beginning to be the main theme of these eleven plays by eleven directors. This means that priority, which could be top priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, is not the case for many other people, for ordinary people. From the opening scene, when an Iranian teacher tries to teach her little students the most important thing that's happened, the kids are not impressed, since the death of a neighbor and such things obviously affect her much more than anything New York, USA, may have done, notes this series of almost documentary pieces that not all things are the same to all men as some world leaders would try to prophesy. <br /> <br /> While the attack on the WTC was obviously a sensitive event, one has the impression that both politicians and television cameramen tend to blow things up on a disproportionate scale - beautifully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same reaction have taken place at international level if, for example, the attack had been launched on Lagos or Jakarta or even Rio de Janeiro? I do not think so. The news seems to be distorted depending on where things happen: in Italy, for example, an earthquake is given far more time for television than ten times more destructive in outer Mongolia. Greater distances seem to reduce the extent of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to bring things to a better perspective - or, I should say, some of the pieces do this, as every completely free director has his own, self-translated story has invented perspective, so that it is not possible to judge the overall merits, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> It should not be assumed that this is an anti-American film: it would be too easy to read the multiple messages that manifest themselves in the segments. It is not pro-American either. The eleven segments have different settings, and the common link, if any, is that the disaster of the WTC attack must be viewed from different angles. Only then will people like George Bush even understand the planet on which he lives. <br /> <br /> One segment clearly states that I am convinced that I have been here for two years: America has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that the US needs to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not through reckless economic persuasion or just violence. Instead of learning that the US can not continue to shape everywhere and everywhere, its political leaders, supported and supported by Blair (and even Aznar), are even more arrogant and intolerant, which does not bring any good in Afghanistan or Iraq at present, let alone elsewhere. The mentality of the White House is totally negative: the US and Britain invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos. So you should eliminate the mess they have created out of the turmoil. <br /> <br /> Radical positions adopted by the US (or even Israel) are hit only by radical positions of Islamic people who have been fanatical for years, if only to cover up their own macho Uselessness, ie stoning women to death or simply wrapping them from their heads on the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of some wealthy countries that seem to be seeking to see or understand anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film shows in eleven individual pieces exactly this gloomy and stupid attitude.
