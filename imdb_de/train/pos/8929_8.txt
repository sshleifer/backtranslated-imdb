First of all, I liked the central idea of ​​locating the "intruders", "others" in the fragile self, on different levels - mostly subconsciously, but sometimes more allegorically. In fact, the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: in the Swiss-French border, where the Pretagonist leads a secluded life; in his recurring daydream and nightmare; In his sick body after a heart transplant ... In the last half of the movie he becomes an intruder himself and returns in the old French colony, hoping to atone for the past. <br /> <br /> The overall sound is more bitter than pathetic, full of remorse and guilt, with the feeling of failure more or less dominant. This is a pretty bleak picture of an age, supposedly self-contained but hopelessly empty and lonely. The director composes the images more to convey temporary feelings of anxiety and desire than explicit meanings. Some of them are mesmerizing, not humorless, a kind of absurdistic game that only a somnambulist can visualize.
