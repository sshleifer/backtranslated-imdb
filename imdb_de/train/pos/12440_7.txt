Conclusion: The Louche Casino in Tangier continues as usual. The casino is about to close and is preparing for a big transaction the next day. Owner Louche and some employees leave for the night leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storms the casino and shoots wild. Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche and are now hiding behind the money in the vault. But nobody who is present at the casino and still alive knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily filled with explosives, so the attackers can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty finds herself in mortal danger with the leader of the gangster Miklos in a roulette game. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a review written unrelated to other published media by Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read any of it. The first point I would like to make is that this is classified a bit wrong. Most of all, I thought this was a thriller in which there was a main fight between Modesty and Miklos. Sure, there are some bursts of action, but they're not really an integral or important part of the story. As mentioned earlier, the main action and the main tension scene is the game between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal the background of a character, and when so much of the story plays outside of the casino at an earlier stage. Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a television series, and the feeling is that it could actually be used as such. But I thought it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others did. I was not at all disappointed with the lack of action, instead I enjoyed this game, the story more than just a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, are very well-made. Especially Modesty shows very well and really wears this self-assured and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
