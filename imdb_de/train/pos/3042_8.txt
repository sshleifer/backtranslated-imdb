The film was all transported until October 20, 1944, when we were apparently part of the big Philippine landing "I Shall Return." It was on the coast of Leyte where General MacArthur earned his fame? <br /> <br /> Especially Gregory Peck won in his performance of the great General ?? It is the step, the set of shoulders, the intensity? What do both men have in common: intensity, total absorption, surrender? With MacArthur it was for the military ?? With Peck, was it the challenge of acting? An Oscar winner for "To Kill a Mockinbird", an Oscar nominee for "Keys to the Kingdom," "The Yearling," "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Twelve O'Clock High" - he has apparently played everything murderous amnesiac a Crusader journalist; from a troubled gunman to an obsessed lawyer; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? He has brought them all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love and above all his sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" is on deck with the "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "Generally, I hope the water is not too deep," says the president, "because my people will find out that I can not swim." Then comes Peck's sonorous voice: "And my people will find that I can not walk on the water!" <br /> <br /> As MacArthur, Peck once again established his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we felt MacArthur's feelings: we knew his anger, his happiness and understood the relationship with his whole family?
