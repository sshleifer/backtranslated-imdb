It's a weekend when I saw this funny movie. and I really like it. All the kids are cute and remind me of my own childhood with these stupid thoughts. It's a really entertaining movie for a group of weekend families that can bring many memories and laughs. Kids humor always works. also nice to act. simple story, but cool shoot. nice work for the director to find the way of the child. When it comes to children's films, I think of "12 and hold". another this year, however, was different from the childrens world, which is real and cruel. good work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and their family need. P.S. Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo from Finding Nemo.
