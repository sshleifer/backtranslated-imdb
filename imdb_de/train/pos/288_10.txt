This movie was so great! I am a teenager and me and my friends love the show. It turns out that these films appeal to all age groups. I recommend it to anyone. My favorite line in this film is when Logan Bartholomew says "rosy cheeks" when he talks about his little daughter. He's such a great actor, as is Erin Cottrell. They fit so well together and have a great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are so attractive people and very good actors. I have finally found films that are good to watch. Lately, I've found it hard to find movies that are good and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheesy.
