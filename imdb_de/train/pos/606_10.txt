I have seen many Saura films and have always found it amazing how he puts together music, dance, drama and big cinema in his films. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura, which deals with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that struck me is the fact that in this film dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows different aspects of the music interpretation and examines not only technical problems, but also the emotional experience of the game. Saura's interest in bridging classical and contemporary music and dance is another ingredient that may make this film one of the most aesthetically pleasing of his other works. That's why I recommend it to anyone who loves good cinema, good music, good dance and good art.
