I saw how it was subtitled in Russian, but I really liked it. The main character Sasha was cursed with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived unhappily all his life because he was different and because anger made him deadly. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to free her and ended in a deadly battle. There was a lot of Gore, but not too much for the weak guys. Not for people who like the regular old Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent films. Kinda has the feeling of an Asian fantasy movie.
