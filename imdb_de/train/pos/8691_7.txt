Master Cinéaste Alain Resnais enjoys working with actors belonging to his family. Also in this film we see family members of resnais such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, Andre Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, who deal with serious issues like death, religion, suicide, love and their overall impact on our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship these people share is obvious, even if they are friends. They address each other with a formal self. In 1984, while making L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory, and space to unravel the secrets of a fundamental issue of human existence: is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a somewhat similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also dealt with love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can shame science even dead lovers find their lost lives back and leave doctors to look after their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is by no means didactic. It is a film in which the musical score is perfectly related to her pictures. This is one of the reasons why this movie can be easily captured.
