A terrorist tries to steal a top secret biological weapon, and when he tries to escape, he becomes infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. Soldiers can retrieve the case, but the terrorist goes to a hotel where he tries to hide. They eventually make it where he hides, and "cleanse" the hotel and its inhabitants. Unfortunately, they dispose of their bodies through cremation, and when you see "the return of the living dead" you know what happens next. Zombi 3 has been described by critics and zombie fans alike as a "panning" complete mess of a movie. That's a fair assessment, but not without the highlights. For one thing, it has a lot of bloody deaths to make the Gore dogs happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seemingly come from everywhere. They're in the water, the rafters of houses hiding in trees, and for some reason they like to hide under a pile of dead brushes, only to be able to jump out when the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head hiding in a fridge. You have to see it to believe it, because Zombi 3 needs to show IMO just because of this scene. It may have a terrible cut and a very questionable spectacle, especially from the doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that requires no more than your time and open-mindedness. Zombi 3 fits this bill and a few more. It's even more fun when you jump up a few beers and look at it with some like-minded friends. I give him 8/10, just for sheer pleasure.
