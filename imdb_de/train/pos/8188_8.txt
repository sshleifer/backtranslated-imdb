I really enjoyed the first part of this two-parter, The Impossible Planet, and was a bit worried that the second part would not hold as well as it did in the past of the two divisors of the last 2 Who series. Luckily my fears were unfounded as I enjoyed the episode as much as I did the previous one. Anyway, we start with the surviving crew members fleeing from the Ood, who have become the devil's peasants. There is also a bit of philosophizing on the side of the doctor in the episode, which I liked very much. Needless to say, it was a good, solid Doctor Who story. It could be a bit too intense for the younger audience. <br /> <br /> My grade: B +
