Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it's the odd couple that made him famous. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. The minor cast for this film is also outstanding. <br /> <br /> These are two cohabiting men from opposite planets. The script is full of humor from this situation. This had previously happened in some forms. This is the one that brings everything together in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon has done other decent work, but this is really his best work that made the rest of his work possible. It is hard to imagine that Simon ever surpasses this.
