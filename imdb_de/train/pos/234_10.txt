I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor. Now I know that she is also a great writer / director. I've been a fan since I saw her for the first time in the movies "Perfect," "My Favorite Year," "DC Cab," and "Stardust Memories." It's so rare that Lee Grant can be seen in these days in something. She has disappeared on the screen for far too long. It's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is her best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie. So I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, watch.
