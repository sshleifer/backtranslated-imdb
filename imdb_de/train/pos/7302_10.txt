Currently, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is approaching its 30th anniversary. It has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a jumble of imitations, and every year around Halloween when they make those "Top 10 Scariest Movies" lists that are always there. This is amazing for a film that was filmed with a budget of around $ 300,000 and had a then almost completely unknown cast of aspiring young talents. I could go on and on, but the big question here is, how is the movie going today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Pros: A simple but spooky header sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and goosebumping music by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great movie art. Director of Carpenter, who keeps the tension high, taking some great shots and taking care not to show too much of his rogue. Good performances from the then mostly unknown occupation. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary, bad guy. Many eerie moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow but steady and never slows. Unlike most other Slasher films, this is more about tension and terror than about blood and a large body size. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Probably not nearly as scary as then. Many of the fools really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I'd like to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know that this is not a popular opinion, but I really feel that way. Still, it's really an important movie, reaching new generations of movie lovers. And just because it's been redone for a new generation does not mean it's forgotten. No way, no how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
