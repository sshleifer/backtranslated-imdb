This movie is visually stunning. Who cares if she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. The film locations, stage sets and costumes convey a perfect representation of the contents of a love story made up of beauty, youth and prosperity. In a way, I want to watch this movie as a tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And that commentary would not be complete without the mention of Anthony Quinn's role as father, mentor, lover, and his portrayal of a man, of men, lost in a bygone era when men were men. There are some of us who value strength and direction and are supported by a trust that contributes to a sense of trust, containment and security. Yes, they do not make men that way anymore! But how often do you find women who were made like Bo Derek.
