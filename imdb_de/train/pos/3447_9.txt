There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But although he made a few films that attracted much international attention, there are still some of his films that have slipped through the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them, and though I've loved it down to the last detail, it's not hard to see why distributors in the West are reluctant to release. <br /> <br /> Between his big and serious films, Oshii is known to do smaller and quirkier projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii has outdone himself with this and created something that's hard to classify, even as a crazy Japanese streak. Go figure. <br /> <br /> At the core is a documentary that is not completely different from Otaku no Video. But instead of fooling into an existing subculture, Oshii invents his own and immerses himself in the lives of culinary heroes by taking away food for nothing and maintaining the Japanese culinary level. Oshii's approach to the subject is closely linked to Dai-Nipponjin, as the subject is treated with a deadly sense of gravity, while the images on screen are as ridiculous as they can be. Dead humor is extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, rather than just shooting his mockumentary, Oshii decided to use a new visual technique that baptized Superlivemation. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animations and dolls on a stick. Performed and implemented by the greats of the Japanese animation industry (or posed, if you want), as the project should be kept as low as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think so, I just want to know that the movie is extremely dialogue-intensive, which makes it a great companion to Innocence. The influence of gardeners is analyzed from all possible cultural, political and even philosophical points of view, which are shot at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues. And to make matters worse, the entire film is fully attuned to Japanese history and customs, making it even harder for foreigners to get the material under control. It is needless to say that multiple visits are recommended to make the most of all the details of the movie. <br /> <br /> That is, at the conceptual level, the movie is easy to follow and quite funny. Various grippers are introduced and were the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The movie acts as if you expect a serious documentation of another important character to unfold, but somehow the big and coarse animated, fragmentary photographic limbs that make up characters do not really take you seriously. The range of introduced characters is great. Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cow creature with nose ring, while he picks up the fast food chains with his gang of bulls / folks Apart from a pretty funny performance, the score ranges from atmospheric and dark to crazy, weird and weird. It's a lot of fun with the exaggerated sounds and effects that complement the animation and completely contradict the sound of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, though it must be said that the animation is fairly concise and effective, but it remains toned down to break out from time to time in hyperactive craziness. That's not a bad thing, because Tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy. Still, the movie is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and tuned to the overall atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But be careful, because Tachiguishi demands a lot from the viewer. If you do not speak Japanese, you have to read a lot and there are many cultural references that require some attention. In addition, the monologues in the film sector are quite tedious and difficult to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles, and although my French was largely sufficient to understand what it was about, I'm sure I've missed many of the intricacies of the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy movie to get in, but halfway it reaches full steam and does not leave from there. I still hope to see this again with English or Dutch submarines. A dub would actually be best for a movie like this, though I think a high-quality anime dub requires a bit too much to ask for it. <br /> <br /> With all this I can only congratulate Oshii for another wonderful movie. It's rare to find a movie that mixes and mixes so many styles and influences that something so unique emerges and yet works. The film is smart, looks good and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity. It is immensely funny, even if you can not see all the details when you first look at it. However, be sure to do this with decent submarines, as the automated English translation that floats out there is completely worthless and does not do any justice to the movie. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is aimed at a very specific audience and I'm not surprised that the French were released, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the western world) is still waiting for a sign of this film. But for those who like Oshii, appreciate dry and disturbed humor and long for creative minds, this is a movie that can not be missed, though it might as well misfire. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
