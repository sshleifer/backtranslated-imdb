Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school graduate who discovers that she has a strong punch and starts amateur training in a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than she, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago was told to save it for his next fight. <br /> <br /> Both participate in a gender-blind sports program that does not distinguish between men and women. <br /> <br /> Recently, a conservative radio commentator has announced - and I swear I do not think so - "Let's face it, the President is black." I am here to make an equally clear observation: "Men and women are different." In 99 out of 100 cases this does not have to affect the physical performance. But in the top half - trained athletes whose skills were refined to a fine advantage - men generally have the advantage. With their narrow hips, they can run faster. And they have more muscle mass and upper body strength. These differences in physique allow women to give birth and raise children, and men can catch and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of a completely natural process of natural selection. Without them there could be no people at all. And that's why, boys and girls, they have men's and women's events at the Olympics. I speak with you as an anthropologist. That will be ten cents, preferably PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this sexless program misguided. As talented a boxer as Rodrigues is, when she approaches the zenith of the game, she will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> That's where the complication comes from in this movie. Rodrigues is finally played against her boyfriend Douglas. No one wants to lose the trouble on the other side, let alone roundhouse rights, but the pride of both is at stake and pride is both personal and gender specific. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as patronizing behavior. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I did not really expect much from the movie. I thought it was a rip-off of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" until I found out that it was released years ago. And I had never heard of the director or any of the actors. This kind of darkness generally leads to morbid television hijackers and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how well this is put together. The total absence of Bathos left me open-mouthed. As little as boxing clich√©s were used - the frayed ropes, the blood, the slicing of the swollen eye, the battered aftermath faces, the fat and sweaty spectator, the "kill me!" Cried, the slow landing of the glove nose, the spatter of sweat from the sprained head, the heroic music signaled the long-awaited apotheosis of the winner. None of this here - well, almost none. The whole plot could be considered formulaic. A hard kid finds spout in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you're left is that this is probably pretty much what those amateur contests look like. Unlike on TV and in ordinary movies. For example, no bells ring. Instead, a dancing and attentive referee shouts "Stop!" And "box!" The participants wear headgear. The gym is not populated by a crowd of cheering spectators, but only by a handful of people who are particularly interested in the events. It's a clean movie, despite the rather gloomy backdrop and the unfortunate family dynamics. Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty mean, glowing with her muscular bulk and her eyes under her lowered forehead, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you up at any moment and as soon as you do the female contours of her super segments hear, she is not bad. (A scene in which she struggles with her father exaggerates.) It was a bit hard to understand how Douglas' restraint crawled around in the bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, has carefully selected his talent. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with talent, imagination and a little money. There should be more films like this. Take one of these billions of blockbusters with dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity a bit.
