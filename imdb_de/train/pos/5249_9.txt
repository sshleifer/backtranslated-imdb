The decision to turn this SNL sketch into a movie was much better than in recent years. The humor that comes with the character is not a nuisance humor, but a character trait that can be stretched for an hour or two because the constraints of live television have made me do it expect. I think I was thinking more of "Leisure Suit Larry" than the producers were ... <br /> <br /> By no means a PG-13 movie that will probably hurt if he ever gets the height of his achieved more successful predecessor, but still better premise and writing than the gloomy. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it will be a hit ... (which is sad, because Tim Meadows does not play any characters) that annoys me with the frequency with which other SNL Alumni tend)
