This funny Bugs Bunny cartoon sees the return of the yet unnamed Marvin, the Martian, and his buddy K-9, the green dog. This time, instead of trying to destroy the earth, Marvin is on a landing mission. catch a creature of the earth and bring it back to Mars. Of course, the creature he picks is Bugs Bunny. At first Bugs believes Marvin and K-9 are tricks or treatments, but realized that this can not be right when Marvin Bugs dramatically increases rabbit hole with a ray gun. Bugs tries to pull himself out of the situation in various ways, including convincing Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. Eventually, he is captured with an Acme straitjacket that ejects Bazooka. Astonishingly, it works as advertised for an Acme product, and Bug's has to use his mind to get K-9 to release him. The tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled Martians are mutilated and Bugs tries to fly their saucer back to Earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed that, although the end is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he becomes emotionally visible when he's angry, but that did not make me any less like him or the cartoon.
