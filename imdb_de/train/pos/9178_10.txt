I have to say, that was always a favorite of mine when I visited my grandma. And it is still like this. It's very, very close to the book. The way it is filmed, and the players were all great! I have to recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but that was really great! I gave it 10/10.
