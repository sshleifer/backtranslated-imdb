One of the greatest science-fiction works of all time, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis is doing his best here, but he's outdone by Pitt's incredibly frenetic twist, unlike anything he's done before or since. Even Stowe is not out of her league here. The story is very complex and offers a lot to think about. The climate scene is beautiful and the last lines are perfect. The scenes in the mental hospital are scary and yet so funny in their own way. Here a lot of dark humor is shown. Fantastic production design and correspondingly bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.
