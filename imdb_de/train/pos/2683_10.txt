Franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal and erotic cinema. While much of his work can be regarded as an entertaining sleaze, with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he really is capable of when he breaks his creativity and offers a hypnotic and enigmatic film, while at the same time preserving the delirium of eroticism his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's wonderful score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario into another as we follow the tests of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic or, in fact, a devil tries (as a mysterious character puts it) to deal with the world in which she lives. A beautiful and enigmatic cinema that is recommended to anyone who is also interested in alternative cinema.
