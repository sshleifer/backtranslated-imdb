As a young teenager, Airwolf was a duty for a generation at that time, who wanted their "Cowboys and Indians" to have amazing gadgets and whiz-bang explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the sky: a similar comic book technology, a central figure who was essentially a loner and reflects the concept of a man who makes the difference makes. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was thematically very important unlike Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A Team and other action shows of the time. First, the premise of the series is not based on the desire to help those in need, but (as a lever to find his brother MIA St John) by the possession of Airwolf by Stringfellow Hawke of essentially selfish reasons. And then there is the dark edge, if you focus the series on a context of the 80-year Cold War, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the inner enemy. Sure, the A team always referred to Vietnam and the status of the team as a fugitive, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely the focus of the story. At Airwolf, the intrigue was the key to the sound and direction of the show - though it was watered down in the course of the series (inappropriate). <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the Cold War setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are squeaky and fictional, and much that Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's not the point. Airwolf was an incredible fun, he tried to tell interesting stories, without relying solely on the big action sequences, and he lavished all by ensuring turned in a miraculous way that no one has died. Sometimes it failed, but it was often admirable - and with a television budget. <br /> <br /> For British readers, DMAX (Sky Channel 155) has just started Airwolf's daily reruns (January 2008). Place your Sky + box for this blast from the past - perhaps even we get the fourth, revised, redesigned (and unfortunately a lot worse) season, which was to my knowledge has not yet been shown in the UK.
