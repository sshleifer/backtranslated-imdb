Entertaining Jim Belushi vehicle, a modern version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that makes Belush see what life would have been like if he "made it big". Jim is best with a good story and a minor cast. seems to be a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. No Oscar contender, but a lot of fun.
