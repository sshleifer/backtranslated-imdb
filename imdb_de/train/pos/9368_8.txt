I just returned from a screening a few hours ago and was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense and the best thing I've been able to cry in a movie for quite some time. That's thanks to Adam Sandler, who does a great job on many levels and who probably deserves an Oscar if he does not appear so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual great performance as he plays the straight man to upset Adam. <br /> <br /> There is some humor, but most of it is really just funny compared to the rousing moments as Adam deals with his loss Don is fighting to help him. Adam is very good on two levels ... If he's mentally stable, he's funny and likeable, but if he's less stable, he's powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who is intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss.
