With some of Hammer's Allstars, this highly effective British horror piece revolves around a house and the fate of its previous tenants whose stories are all told to a detective from Scotland Yard who is looking for a missing actor <br /> story number one, probably the least impressive of the four is about a writer and his wife who have just moved in and intend to stay only for a short time so that he can write one of his horror novels. He creates a crazy character named Dominic, who is a very scary-looking strangler, and quickly goes crazy as he sees this vicious-looking man everywhere he goes. After his wife persuades him to seek psychiatric help, he introduces a subplot that honestly did not really work for me. I will not spoil it. <br /> <br /> In the next story (the best in my opinion), the wonderful Peter Cushing plays the lead role as Philip Grayson, a man who has come home for his retirement years and this soon makes his way to one nearby wax museum (located in Makabren), where he is very surprised to find a waxwork that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon after, an old friend (who also has a story with this woman) is on business in the city and comes to him. The two men expect a rude awakening when they soon realize that this woman has more to offer than it seems. <br /> <br /> Tell three stars, one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, John plays Reid. After moving into the house with his peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny he hires becomes extremely suspicious of the way Reid suppresses his daughter. Well, to find out ... If she had known what Lee did, she would surely have understood. The last story is a rather lighthearted vampire story featuring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After purchasing a robe from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson becomes a creature portrayed several times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pace and direction were very good, as were most of the performances. Here and there were beautiful gothic accents and an effective touch that complements the ambiance. This is a keeper, and is highly recommended.
