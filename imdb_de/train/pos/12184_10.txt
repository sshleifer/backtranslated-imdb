In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil) Orson Welles gave him the role of an exuberant man. In "The Lady from Shanghai" I only see the role of the victim. The role of the offender, he gave Rita Hayworth, I think he was in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I think the story is also excellent. The direction is ingenious, as usual with Welles: Two scenes are particularly brilliant: the one in the aquarium and the last one with the mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
