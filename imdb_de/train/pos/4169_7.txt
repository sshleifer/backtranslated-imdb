Yes, it was a small budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing is that you can say that the budget in this film is not comparable to "Waterworld". Although the plot was good, the movie never really exhausted its full potential! Strong performances by everyone and the tension makes it worth seeing on a rainy night.
