This movie is a kind of Carrie meets Heavy Metal. It's about a high school guy who's packed with a lot and totally avenging himself with the help of a heavy metal mind. It is such a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have living legends of Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal fans.
