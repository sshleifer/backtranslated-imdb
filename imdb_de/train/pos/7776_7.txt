Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stacks could have been a Masseratti. The character of Rock Hudson told his father that he accepted a job in Iraq. Is not this the right time? I had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank most of my life, maybe this was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall certainly had a few punches in this movie and probably outperformed Malone, but Malone's part made a more sensational impression, so she got a sensational impression The Oscar for Best Supporting Role. Was Loren a leader? The old Hadley character was probably a fairly general picture of tycoons of his time, as he was a normal guy who made it big in an emerging industry, but in building a whole city he had forgotten his kids that his wife had them let raise. As a widow, he understood that this was all he really had, and they were spoiled, in search of attention, and did not try to relate to his children, which he blew his head away. An old moral story. But seriously, what were these sports cars?
