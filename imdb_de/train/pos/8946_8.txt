This impossible story is about a female witch hounding a mortal man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among her members, but she hides her witchcraft from the mortals. Hmmmm ... that sounds familiar. LOL. It is not a typical movie. Very "campy" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I find it unusual (but not fatal for the story) for James Stewart to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new viewers ...... It's still a joke!
