Aside from an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy-tale fantasy has a fun and sexy undercurrent of adult cynical wit that paves the way for the audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully spurs on this mythical epic. Apart from one of the Robert DeNiro scenes, which does not look smooth and does not look in sync with the rest of the movie, this lush romantic fairytale tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and balance between serious adventure scenes and lighter mental humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE fascinates this contemporary representation of magic and love. Eight out of ten stars.
