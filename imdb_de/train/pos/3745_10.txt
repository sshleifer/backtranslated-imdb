Many mystery stories follow the standard path, which is the worst murder, the worst murder, the gathering of clues, the screaming of potential culprits, the spraying of red herrings and the inevitable showdown between crafty evildoers and an even smarter criminal. "Forgetting" gives up the idiot and gives us complex characters who have committed terrible deeds or not. The fact that we have no simple answers at the end of three episodes and no carefully tied package may frustrate some, but for me it was a reference to a cleverly designed story that examines the question, bothers and persecutes the evil person? <br /> <br /> Combine excellent acting and production to make a puzzle that is not so easily forgotten ....
