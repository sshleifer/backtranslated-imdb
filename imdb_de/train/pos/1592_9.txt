"What I like about you" is definitely a show I could hardly wait for every day. Amanda Bynes is a great actress and I grew up with her show: 'The Amanda Show'. She is a very funny person and seems down to earth. "Holly" is such a like-minded person and has an "out-there" personality. I enjoyed that she always turned things upside down and sometimes she herself was nasty. But that made the show so great. <br /> <br /> I really loved the show when the character 'Vince' came. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as is Gary, Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was awesome, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially loved 'Lauren'; She is the best! She helped make the show extra fun, and you never know what she's going to do or say next! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason why I did not give it a 10 was because there are no more episodes and because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
