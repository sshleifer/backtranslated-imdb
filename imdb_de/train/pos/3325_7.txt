OK, I would not normally watch a movie by the Farrelly brothers. I can not remember ever seeing one. I also can not remember seeing a Jimmy Fallon movie. Okay, I looked at a taxi, but I said penance and I was forgiven this mistake. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I think she's the cutest thing. I do not know what it has to do with her, but I smile the whole time I watch her. She just fascinates me like that. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates. How sad is that? This was not the best baseball movie - it should not be. It was a love story about a sad puppy who clung to the only one who never failed him until he found something that would be worth giving up. It had a predictable ending, but it was traveling so much that it's worth it.
