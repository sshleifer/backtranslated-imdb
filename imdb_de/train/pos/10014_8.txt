The Night Listener caught my attention and Robin Williams shone as a radio host in New York City, in love with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams never met the boy in person because he was only in contact with him by phone. Williams' ex-boyfriend (nice work by Bobby Cannavale), however, raises doubts about the boy, causing Williams to arrange a personal meeting with him. What follows influences Williams in ways he does not expect. I will leave it at that. Toni Collette also plays a major role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Toni Collette has given a memorable presentation of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh was also a friend of Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by the real events and has a dark, almost eerie silence. Sometimes it's predictable, no, thanks to some reviews I read before watching the movie, for logical reasons, but I liked it anyway. I like Williams in such roles more than his comedic characters, which adds an extra bonus to me. Recommended. 8.10
