I do not think that was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated story, but interesting. It's a good movie to watch if you do not want to think much, just tell a simple story. The Canadian landscape was breathtaking. But the beautiful autumn shots made the picture worth seeing.
