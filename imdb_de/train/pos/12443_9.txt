I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see a version that came so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> A number of people did not like the movie, but it has to be seen in the context of the film's genesis. The film uses a flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that have made her the woman she has become. In front of the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The tempo is a bit slow, and for my taste, there is not enough tension in today's scenes. However, this is acceptable to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll enjoy it too with its flaws, if you just want an action strip with chases - forget it. <br /> It feels like being the first in a franchise, but since I've never seen it promoted anywhere, I suspect it will not be followed by any more. Sad.
