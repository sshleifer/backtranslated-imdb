Yes ... I go over it with the 1: 0 and here is the reason. In recent years, I have seen a whole series of comedies and left a few mild laughs and a few video stores, because the films were so easy to forget. Then I stumble over "nothing". Looked interesting, but had not expected much. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Dave and Andrew form a great comedic couple and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not overly complex until the joke was missed. I do not want to go into any of the actual scenes because I think this is a movie that's worth a visit. With more and more meaningless concepts that appear in movies (like killer military jets and "fresh" remakes that ruin old classics), you'll be happy to say that it's okay to laugh at "nothing".
