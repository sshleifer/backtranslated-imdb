John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped patient patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to persecute and kill a group of babysitters. Carpenter shows great restraint as he walks the story very slowly and builds likable characters. Unusual for a horror picture. Even more unusual is the absence of blood and blood, yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Get that! <br /> <br /> Halloween was the movie debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a pivotal point in the career of the late great Donald Pleasance. A true classic.
