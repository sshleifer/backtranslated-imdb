This was a favorite of my childhood - I remember seeing it on TV and getting thrilled every time. Now that I'm an adult and have a kid, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We saw it last Friday and liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over to grab my - he was really scared. "Will he hit the spider, Poppa?" Look, you see. It has no historical reference point (eight years old), so under the grandson of Haroun al-Rashid, Baghdad might as well be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he liked it a lot The exploits and the mocking were done by the young thief and not by the grown-up king. In fact, if you deconstruct the narrative of the movie a bit, the king is the buddy of the thief, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying for imaginative, adventurous boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a bit out of time - I suspect that if my son is eleven or twelve, he'll find it "stupid" or whatever the word of the next generation will be until then. The love story is hardly one-dimensional - as a cynical friend said, "Why does Ahmad love the princess because the story demands it?" Equally unlikely is the readiness of Abu to endanger himself (repeatedly) for the unsuspecting, love-struck king. But arguing about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifteen-meter-long geniuses, and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye would be extremely extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the climax of the film is enormous, as is the last shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet looking for "some fun and finally adventure".
