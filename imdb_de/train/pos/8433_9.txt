The acting in this film was great, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa, it was terrible. It was good that the writer who isolated Boesman and Lena ran from others out of their homes so that we could fully share their successes and failures. the conflicts that they shared when they grew together and differed. Worth seeing if you put the film in its right context.
