Texture and character are far richer than the classics of the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born Scrooge, just as he was born Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge, as played by Mr. Scott, seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust, yet deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in eighteenth-century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, understandable and highly conflictive level. His role was played with the great authority Scott always brought to the screen. But his usual warlike voice was sometimes whispered, almost like a soliloquy, as if he were going to scold the Christmas holidays with one breath and still show his own human weakness in his next line. He could portray the sour and crispy Scrooge and a misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge in the same scene. A truly remarkable achievement of a giant of his generation.
