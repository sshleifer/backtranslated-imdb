Beautifully done with a wonderful performance by Gretchen Moll that captures so much happiness in her work, and the replicas of the little films and the photographs are perfect and often funny. According to Harron, they used footage that is no longer produced and studio-style lighting in the 1950s style, even for the outside, to give the color parts a distinctive look. Bettie Page saw the movie in Hugh Heffner's house (she is now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not with the director, in case she got uncomfortable if she did not like it. She apparently seemed to do so until the official inquiry, which she found disconcerting. Also great costumes. The idea for the movie started in 1993, but the wait was worth it. The portrait of her never seems to be wrong in relation to all the pictures and cut-outs (horrible) movies that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting companion piece to Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable!
