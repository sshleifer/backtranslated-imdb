This was seen in our theater in Amsterdam, and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went to the subject without knowing anything, except it was a documentary about the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune, because it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the world. This film has some of the most breathtaking photographs I've ever seen in a movie, taking places from the desert to the sea to the rainforest, showing things I've never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student should see before he is dulled. I will encourage my niece to see this movie as it will inherit the planet we are leaving. This is also a movie that can be seen on a theater screen or on a very large TV because the photography is so powerful and exotic.
