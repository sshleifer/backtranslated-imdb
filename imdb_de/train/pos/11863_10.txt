Perhaps this could be the best film ever made, and if not, it is certainly one of those burnt to your students, as Brian De Palma delivers a great cinematic artwork here. First, there is the touch of the director of Brian De Palma, who once again proves that he is possibly one of the best directors ever. There's the excellence of Al Pacino, who delivers on the big screen (Tony Montana) an immortal hero many different (violent) scenes you'll never forget (the one with the chainsaw Tony is sitting in a bath in which is the size of most people's living rooms), there are many excellent one-liners (count how many times the word "f * ck" is used), there are the excellent little details (the Pan American globe, the "The World is yours ") or the great Descomusic by Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named, which is not exceptional here, and together with "The Godfather", "Good People" and "White Heat" it is easily one of the best gangster movies ever made!
