The best Modesty Blaise movie I've ever seen. It's like a good pilot for a TV series. I even think it's a bit of a cult, like a touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic or something. They've gotten a lot of Modesty's character, but I admit I missed Willy Garwin a bit. Although I have read many comics and books by Peter O'Donnell, I am not disappointed in this film, quite the contrary. Positively surprised by this story about Modesty and her childhood. I did not put my expectations because of the bad movie of 1966 so high. Maybe I just overvalued this movie a bit. But if you like the comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see them! can not wait for a follow-up ...
