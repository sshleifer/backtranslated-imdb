"Who did it?" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It's not just one of Shemp's best Stooges films, but one of Columbia's finest short comedies. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay for the Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke, he was for the Columbia Comedy Team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror.") Obviously it was too Good for the Stooges to miss them, and finally she was filmed in late 1947 by the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Old man Goodrich calls Ace detectives Shemp, Larry and Moe out of fear that he wants to be murdered When they arrive at his house, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and various crooks are trying to get rid of the stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and thugs to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially funny in this movie. His reactions, after receiving a Mickey from Christine McIntyre, are outstanding. He gives his typical sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre tries not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the dark fight with all involved actors. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his knotted hair he could almost go for a henchman, if he would not overtake everyone else! "Who did it?" is a jewel among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even hardcore Curly fans will enjoy it! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
