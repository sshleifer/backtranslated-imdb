Although it has one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price. Gallico has the quality missing in so many horror movie characters. When you see it, you feel for it, feel its frustration, the injustices against it, and you cheer it when it takes revenge, even though it scares you a bit with its original rage. As the film progresses, its character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he has to kill to cover it up. And to cover that up again. And again ... your stomach sinks with its soul as it goes down its spiral - as if a beloved brother would turn into a hood. Even though the revenge story is old, the action devices themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in ever more resourceful ways. Too bad that this is not available for Heimveiwing.
