First of all, I think the following comment is unworthy of such a website. Obviously you have no taste and do not respect the taste of others. I do not want to give you a history lesson, but I think it has to be done. Black actors out there are just more successful than others. If you are not part of the "Black" breed, you can not understand the quality, creativity and vibrancy of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Unfortunately, because you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we look at these classics. So you have to hold your damn mouth and just stay in your non-dancing race. Many Thanks.
