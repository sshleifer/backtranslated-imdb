I give this movie 7 out of 10 points because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown Batwoman creates an interesting "guessing game". But the movie needs more Robin. He appeared in the movie at first, and sporadically in the rest of the time. I always thought the new animated series would do little justice to the neat new Robin character, let alone Knightwing. This movie continues this bad tradition. The movie spends too much time with Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in a movie if the romance were not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.
