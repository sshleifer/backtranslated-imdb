It was an excellent piece for the puppet series, because this film showed all series from one to seven. And this was a woman trying to stop the new puppeteer because I never thought the dolls would be in pain. It also showed some of the puppet master series that I did not see and what I should see so that part 2 is so bad. It showed a look of Torch that can turn things and people, which is cool, and showed the puppeteer's return from Part 1. It also showed little aliens from Part 4 who were also cool and showed other episodes that might be good were for her, and did it too.
