Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a FBI-hunted serial killer. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for evidence and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widowed father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father collects the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God has just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons , What happens next is one of the scariest films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four years ago on VHS and yesterday on DVD. Although it's a low-budget movie, the script is sharp and error-free. The cast is outstanding, but I want to highlight Matt O'Leary's performance as a young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role that a young teenager has to play. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this film: "A Mão do Diabo" (The Hand of the Devil). If it were at least "The Hand of God," it might be acceptable. But calling this film "the hand of the devil" is indeed ridiculous. Screenwriter Brent Hanley did not deserve such respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is strongly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Hand of the Devil")
