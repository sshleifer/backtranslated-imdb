Basically, the movie could be one of the most intriguing titles made by the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it clear the movie deserves its hype as one of the most stylish action / thriller ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to angry tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scott are a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers that you can expect. Washington felt very comfortable in the shaky cameras and the executive scenes of the movie. One could easily be associated with the emotions of his character and therefore enjoyed all the murders on the street. It is a success that they have created an extremely dark city with a lot of shit. One could easily be convinced by the extent of the corruption shown in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think if they saw this ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's see it again. It is one of the best in the Death Wish genre, but also suffers from massive violence. It is a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the film very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the type of "missing sheep" as a tragic hero. In the end, even the kidnapper was shot like a documentary in his own swimming pool. I checked on IMDb if the movie is based on real events. So that's a consideration for you, even if you consider the theme of the film as something spurious. <br /> <br /> In the end I hope you would not think this movie is real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for Art Direction / Cut / Film / Denzel Washington.
