This movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. All actors are pretty real and very strange. The overall picture of the film also looked different, somehow dreamy and faded, which only contributed to the spacey, fiddly, strange atmosphere of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you would call "mainstream", but I liked that. It's different than anything I've ever seen. , , unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and punch in the strangest places. The children are so heartbreaking (and spotty) that you can not help but feel for them. In other words, it's far from "Hollywoodized" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Everything that is a good thing for me.
