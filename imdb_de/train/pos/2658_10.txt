Kubrick once again demonstrates his impressive ability to create the perfect setting for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but also through an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that stretches across the entire film and tingles my spine from the start. It's really this immaculate ambiance that makes The Shining a masterpiece in my eyes. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson offers one of the best performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic depiction of a crazy mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial to be nice, but it's easy to drop by when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. Add to that the actor with the biggest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
