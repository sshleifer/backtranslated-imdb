I was 16 when I saw the movie for the first time and he has always been a HUGE favorite of mine. Of course you can not dispute the charm of Kristofferson in the movie - how good is this man ????????????? Sheesh He is still. He is the bad boy that every woman secretly wants. His acting is flawless. He just played a drunk like someone who had really gone through it - and he had done it - in 1976 he had finally gotten in the car, so everything was very real. <br /> <br /> The music is great and even though in later years I thought Streisand was not the right person for him in physical beauty, I think that this is more of a problem for male viewers than for women. We girls are just looking at Kris - and of course the boys are looking at the female interest - my husband can not see the movie - he does not like her look. But I made him just sit by the red Ferrari scene at the end of the road, just to see how well it was done - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with the music - you I should have WOW !!!! And finally the transmission quality was GREAT - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great colors and very low noise, except for dark areas, which is normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> I have brought some great memories of my mother and me, who loved this movie together, I bought a copy for her at Christmas, which I saw together with her yesterday. <br /> <br / > I tried to go through the original with Judy Garland, but I guess when I first saw it, I just can not go back to the earlier era, seeing all the concert material in the '76 version was like this as if I were in time /> <br /> I'm working through Streisand's comment, but she just seems to be talking about herself and the s. So far, she has barely mentioned Kris or details about the scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds exactly like it did then. <br /> <br /> Take a look inside, if you grew up at the same time as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
