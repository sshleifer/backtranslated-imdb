This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen lately. Goes beyond any international movie even by reputation. I'm really surprised why this did not get the recognition it deserves. Sonali Kulkarni, who wins the National Award, is perhaps the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar is surprised when she speaks volumes through her eyes. There are some scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city at the wedding of Krishna, she meets Krishna for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialogue is said. The full range of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes. There is another one towards the end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you are not moved by this scene, you have no heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to see the brilliant film production and acting skills.
