Hidden Frontier has been discussed and reported by several news agencies for their long involvement in creating the best Star Trek stories and as an example of Gene Roddenberry's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and racial acceptance is equal to or better than that of other Trek series and films. The production value started out as smaller and choppy, but in the seven production seasons the drama has improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have become smoother and more impressive. In Season 6, Episode 1, Countermeasures, there's one of the biggest space battles in Trek history. The ships are well done and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real attraction for Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but the people and the interaction and growth of the characters. There are also allusions to other trek series and movies with places and characters that we all know. I recommend every Trek fan to review the countermeasures and you will be amazed!
