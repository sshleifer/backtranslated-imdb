A great movie, more demanding than really entertaining. Unfortunately, no memorable quotes, but this one is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you loved, you have to say what I'm going to tell you: "Farewell, I'm leaving." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal is unworthy. (I did not see it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion that expresses everything. There are so many tactics in the relationship between Alexandre and the others, and yet everyone is longing for a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences. Usual interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of a "liberated love" by the undesirable effects on the affected persons. It shows this convincingly, but I would appreciate it if the reasons had been discussed in more detail: it is not that liberated love in itself is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should be in themselves work by themselves and try to overcome the prevailing morals, not by practicing liberated love. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie is realistic and really worthwhile.
