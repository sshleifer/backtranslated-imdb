How do you summarize how good and correct and how touching this film is? For several weeks, this DVD jumped off the shelf every time I walked into the store - after seeing Steve Carrell in a couple of movies before, I did not want to smear my thoughts on him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it with a "what the hell!" Attitude! And how surprised I was! I only wish I had bought it earlier. After seeing it three times in two days, I still smile like the image of a widower who fights with three daughters longs for what has been missing since the death of his beloved wife, who meets such a fascinating woman who she In such a way, a deep and interesting charm (dare I say book songs?) throws a very different light into the life that realizes that it is exactly what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> The hook of this woman, who is his brother girl, makes it difficult to count - which makes Dan funny and shy when he sees that his "special person" brings so much fun and joy into the family home as well as the life of his brothers. They are just beginning to feel for him. <br /> <br /> When the Blind Date with Ruthie Draper comes in, this is the turning point in Marie's assessment of Dan !! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment because he does not like Ruthie - a mere green-eyed monster! Trigger of an absolutely funny scene, as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the best developed when Dan begins to relax with respect to Marie. <br /> <br /> Other terrible scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, which is confronted by his brothers to describe what has just happened .... when Dan's face falls, it brings a sharp breath !! His youngest daughter, Lilly, who gives the gift to celebrate her love for Suzanne, brings his deceased wife a bit of warmth and a sip as Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings in the talent show ... his voice breaks slightly as he repeats the song. ... an absolute gem! <br /> <br /> Acceptance of what happens late in the movie through his daughters ... they all love their father and want to see him happy, does not make him deny his love for Marie; Dan's desperation not to abandon his daughters, because he is their rock, their fortress ... and in a few words more than that say I'll leave it for now - maybe come back and paste in next Future ... but I'll say in the end: .... <br /> <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie thats just so damn good, with weird twists to that To lighten drama that never feels compelled or crass, that acts as a true portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just a woman, but also his extended family. Then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 points for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by Sondre Lerche that leads you through it without being intrusive. Performances of the ensemble. I can not wait to see it again !!
