In the 70s, Charlton Heston played in sci-fi films of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the better ones. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 in New York. In the future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. When Thorn learns the unappetizing truth about this product, he is on the run. <br /> <br /> I think it's only natural that this movie seems dated today. Nevertheless, it still raises interesting questions as to what will become of our agriculture. Also with Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his last role).
