First, an explanation of what a great movie is for me. The excitement of not knowing what's coming next makes me enjoy a movie when I look at it for the first time (Case en Point: Twister). There are other things that lead to a great first impression, such as a good mood (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas is) THE MAN) and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the cinema and buy a DVD or VHS cassette? Character. With that said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every single scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most convincing reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good topic (I can not start because I do not want to ruin it). Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Impressive! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and the compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey - I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Her voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. In your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? This is an obscene area for a 7-year-old (obscenely meant in the best possible way). Well done. This is the best performance of a kid I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor beat the Von Trapp kids - no trifle!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and surprisingly sensitive (that really showed in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unspoken utterances (one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong - she really turns into Cindy Lou Who. And if she leads dialogues, she is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ********************************** Spoiler alert ****** *************** ************************* ********* *********************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when The Grinch sees for the first time. This is a classic quote ( "You are of /" and then filled with the Grinch-line "because since the GRINCH - after she tipped into the sorter and then rescued by The Grinch). Thank you for saving me" quote and subsequent response from The Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite section of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. This scene is two excellent actors who interact best with each other Expressing one another: Little Taylor Momsen can quite well assert himself with Jim Carrey at this point. I sincerely hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many more movies. All in all, everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses). ,
