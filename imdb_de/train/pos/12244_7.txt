As winter approaches, our state broadcaster, ABC, has for some reason decided to host a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday night. This began last Sunday with a twelve-year-old movie version of "Emma"; newer versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" will come. <br /> <br /> The curious thing about this production by A & E Television Networks, with a script by Reliable Andrew Davies, is that he appeared almost simultaneously with two larger budget movie versions, one with Gwyneth Paltrow and "Clueless", a "modernized" version with Alicia Silverstone, who transported the action to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale at the helm, this production sank without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a rule, much is lost when novels are reduced to the length of the feature films. The adjustments that you enjoy and remember at the same time are sufficient to develop both the story and the characters. One outstanding example is Brideshead Revisited, which had 13 fifty-minute episodes in 1982. All you have to do is compare the normal film length of "Pride and Prejudice" from 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six-part TV miniseries. It's not that a novel should be filmed side by side, and some novels (often not very good ones) fit in wonderfully with the film ("Atonement" is a recent example), but Jane Austen-type novels need Time and space to practice your full of charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adjustment, this production is fine. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is an open Mr. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane recycled more characters than Knightly is an articulated version of the mournful Mr. Darcy of P & P). Samantha Morton was a rather flabby Harriet, but Prunella Scales had got the flabbergasting Miss Bates perfect. Sybil Fawlty on speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also excellent. We saw the wet landscape, the mud and poverty and the classy interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for all. <br /> <br /> Although this was a condensed adaptation, was it strangely slow in places? some of the conversations were rather stilted, even allowing for the formalities of the time. I have to look at the movie again to be sure, but it may be because the reaction shots are underused. <br /> <br /> If you like filmed stuff, this is a perfect example. and compares well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, there is more!
