'Cry Freedom' is a film about how far people will go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting account of an unusual friendship between activist Steve Biko and editor Don Woods (fanatically played by Dezel) Washington and Kevin Klein). As the second half deals with Woods, he looks for answers to Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people prefer the first half of the film, which focuses on the unusual friendship between Biko and Woods. I found the second half of Don Wood's effort to hear the story of Biko around the world much more interesting.
