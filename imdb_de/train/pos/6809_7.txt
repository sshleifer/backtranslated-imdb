That was a pretty good movie. I am not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I did not want to take any chances. In any case, at the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a scriptural passage and then cites another from memory. I can not remember the first passage he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use for defense to use the death penalty. It is a pity that prosecutors today do not dare to quote the Bible. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court Justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad that we have lost this view in America.
