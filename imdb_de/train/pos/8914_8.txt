I grew up in Royersford, Pennsylvania. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember that my whole family saw the shoot. I remember a guy who showed me and my brothers the "blob" in a bucket. I also want to say that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was the same as Aneta Corsaut. One evening she was ill. They saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen to take a few blows from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and told her a story until she died last August. My mother was not a teenager and she was a few months after the birth of my little sister.
