Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) being banished from his kingdom because his father (the king) was killed by the clich√© "bad counselor". This movie is about Simon's adventure. The special effects, plot, acting and generally everything about this film is bad. It is so bad that it is funny. You'll just keep watching this movie because it's so bad it's funny, and as the other reviewer of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.
