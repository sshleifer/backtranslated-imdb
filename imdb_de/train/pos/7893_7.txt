I think I'm part of the dumb minority that enjoyed this movie. Is it one of the best of the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger achieves his evil, shaky potential. With parts 4 and 5 lagging behind the series, I felt that this so-called final episode ("New Nightmare" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump. There are some great nightmare sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner that falls into the bin, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that controls Freddy. This is a very original and funny sequence, especially when we see it from the dreamscape and hopping around like Super Mario. And Freddy gets the funny one-liner "Great graphics" out. And since the film was filmed about ten years ago, it woke memories when Freddy controlled the game with the Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo will remember the Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Lisa Zane is in the lead. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man" and I think the last time I saw the movie was about five years ago. He's another great, underrated actor with a strong screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best is from Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare"), who plays a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence in the end is really great! For those who want to watch this movie, borrow or buy it on DVD! I hope all editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the 3D edition was removed in the video edition. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have not seen much wrong with the film. It even went into Freddy's backstory. The movie is a great mix of humor and fear, and the gross effects are great. Could that do the franchise better? Of course it could be. But Rachel Talalay has done a good job. And finding the perfect finish is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> Finally, I loved the montage over the opening credits. Fans of the series will be thrilled and consider them as a tribute to the beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
