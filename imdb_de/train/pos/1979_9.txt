Me and my friend Annette saw this together and commented on both. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed seeing this, even though Dicken had some freedom. Many of Dicken are a bit dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed all that. It was funny, colorful (both visual and musical) and the characters were carefree. TRAVIS: Normally, I'm not particularly interested in music and dance films, but the melodies in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: That really says a lot, what comes from Travis. I can not stress enough how good the dance numbers were. For example, one could say that these guys worked really hard to bring the routines to perfection. TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really make a good bad guy. This one scene, where you see your eyes through the letter slot, gave me shivers down your back ... AWESOME. And this boy Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was awesome (man, I felt bad when she was killed). She can sing too! Kudos to the casting department for their decisions there. I hated the Oliver Twist kid. For my taste he was just too vinous and too weak. (I always wish Bill Sikes would throw him in the mud during the persecution scene.) And they should not have let him sing either. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really great. In addition to the three stars that Travis mentioned, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did an excellent job. He was so funny and at the same time a bit scary. The supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe wore his Mr. Bumble role very well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe in another movie titled "Davy" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been involved in many other films. TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not quite the book, but IMO was more robust. This movie was not boring, as it seems in some musicals. And the continuity has moved you along with the characters correctly. The tunes did not affect the plot and did not put you to sleep because they were too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Every musical film that Travis completely watches must be a rare find. And that is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy-to-watch production that carries the viewer gently and comfortably to the end. On a day when movies seem to be all effects, combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined score for this result was 8.5 out of 10. (In this case, we round up to 9). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated this rating as 7, mainly because the Oliver Twist boy (Mark L.) irritated me and his songs were torturing my too sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. Movies will not be much better. And you can say that everyone involved in this production worked really hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece of musicals. It is really a rare pleasure.
