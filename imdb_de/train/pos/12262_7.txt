About thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published an interview with Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film gets in with Sadoul today as he remembers the interview while we listen to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and see old photos and shots of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and we now know that they were dealing with his separation from his wife after having an affair with one of his co-workers (which would become his second wife years later). , , One interesting thing that the film does not address well is the shift in Tintin books from the early right and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in Soviet countries) to relatively anti-imperialist books just a few years later (The Blue Lotus) , On the whole, I come from this movie and know a few things more about Herge and see him a little more unlikely than when I come to the theater.
