First, consider the length of time this movie was shot. 1995. Rapper was there, and that added to the flair. Remy was a socially awkward teenager trying to find him, by the way, and could not, until he met and became friends with Nazis. They picked him up. Nazis are not so awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a gap that is missing, be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the hot shot track star with questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He always tried to repent of himself and his misery, and his girlfriend and professor had made him cleanse him. Kristen was a young white girl who tried to find herself and to fit until she was raped. She then found her own experiment with her sexuality and became politically active. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism. As with most things that deal with racism, people's own perspective comes into play. <br /> <br I read so many comments that there were no "bad" black characters, but there were bad white (Nazis). So what? Remy was not portrayed as angry, he tried to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see how he developed. He even says, before he kills himself, I did not mean it, I wanted to become an engineer. Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were furious black men, Ice Cube was an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was portrayed as a stupid thug. Both did not pay any attention to their roommates and do not seem to like white people in general. They were furious like the Nazis, but not at the level of the Nazis in terms of general wickedness. I'm sorry if that seems unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = -bad black = good. The only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (Omar Epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and reckless. Although her constant harassment by the police seemed to justify part of her anger. Remy's inability to adjust seemed to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all films dealing with racism, it's a great way to start a discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta could beat these Nazis.
