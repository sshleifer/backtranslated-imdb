"Shall We Dance" is an excellent movie because it shows how something like dancing can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human mind. Dance is seen as an expression of the existence and birth of individuality. That's certainly the case with Aoki. At work, he is a modest office dweller, but put him on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this publication is frowned upon in Japan because of the rigid culture of conformity. At the beginning of the movie, all characters are ashamed or afraid of their desire to dance. They are disdained or considered perverted because they express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth experiencing the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.
