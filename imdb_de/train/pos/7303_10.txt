I saw this classic for the first time only a few weeks ago. Made almost 30 years ago, I thought the scary moments would be more tame. Boy, I was wrong. There are some great moments that left me shivering. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was great. <br /> <br /> One downside is that the start can be a bit slow, but once it starts, you can not stop it. It makes all imitators, z. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can not really say that Carpenter is best because I have not seen many of him. The only one I can remember is Starman (I think he did it). Halloween is the culmination of the horror genre.
