Richard Linklater's beautiful blend of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the most romantic films of the 90s, which are the most thinking people. In one of the most exciting performances of the decade, Julie Delpy presents herself as a Parisian girl spending a day with stranger Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and tons of it) is sometimes meandering and overly valuable, but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers who create a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to each other is filled with wonderfully amusing, touching, and insightful moments.
