If you've never seen anything like the fight scenes in Matrix, you've never seen this movie before. The battle scenes were choreographed by action-scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also led the battles in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays a super soldier who has no pain and now lives as a pacifist librarian (you got me). As other evil supersoldiers start killing local drug lords to take over the drug trade, Li works with his policeman to help them stop them. Badguy gets his arm chopped off with a glass and barely notices). The fighting scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; The body count is high up. Li was rarely better and he surrounded himself with a group of beautiful female costumes (Yip kicking another super soldier in the ass). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no surprises there, he does a cameo in every HK movie). It's unfortunate that they do not shoot action movies in the US. I would not have to afford all those terrible synchronous jobs to see this action that I long so much for. Recommended.
