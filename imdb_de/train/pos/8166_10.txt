This movie is very good! Acting is good, with excellent casting by Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. In the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman and then he goes crazy. He also takes his revenge on his wife and the poolman, next to the patients he torments. Most of the special effects are nice too, though some are really fake (like a bored tongue that spent a night outside and still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are done absolutely well. Although this film has the flaw, it is very slow; Between the heavy parts are sometimes extremely boring parts. But for the real horror / thriller fan this is a must!
