It's no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus. This film is also a bad decision, but one that made me happy. The first 5 minutes are the least inspiring 5 minutes in a movie. boring, bad dialouge and then, with a spiderman attitude, Busey screams the best and worst line in a movie ever made ... "Her worst nightmare, but thorn!" I coughed some of my eggnog and laughed so hard. This line sounds so good that it even surpasses Clooney's notorious "Hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments are that Busey is always upset that people remind him that his former CIA partner was killed ... what he did when he accidentally shot him in the chest (all through a super-slow motion). Flashback sequence, which makes the observing of color seem dry to be exciting). There's an ashtray on the back of the neck, slaps in the face and a "that was not my fault and you know it!" The footage shows that he missed the bad guy and hit his buddy, so ... Other loud screams must be his ex-girlfriend dropping a grenade on the floor to allow his escape - a plan that will suit everyone defies logic, physics and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of Thunderblast during a fierce guerrilla war and starts running and hurting a small object, I'm almost soaked. Some of Busley's best works by far, rent or buy today "butthorn!" My voice is a perfect 10 (on the poo-meter).
