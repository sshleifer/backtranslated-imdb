This must be one of my favorite movies, as opposed to the faint "Elvira Haunted Hills" ... Anyway, I love that the movie is a goth / com story "Wizard of Oz" ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is a Goth Dorothy stranded in a strange city after the death of a good witch (Elviras Aunt Morgana) ... She inherits a "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and sought after by Bad Warlock (her uncle) becomes. She becomes friends with four characters, which she continuously helps to grow with a dog in tow throughout the movie. There is a show with her uncle (the evil witch of the West), in which Elvira realizes that she has the power in her and finally defeats him. In the end, it is sent down by the city's inhabitants after conquering their hearts, and finally arrives at its destination in Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the Wizard of Oz movie ... she and her uncle cite both lines that are relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There is no place like home, there is no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my pretty and your little dog!" There is a sign that Elvira is passing by when she was on her road trip for the first time mentioning the state of Kansas /> <br /> But apart from that, the fact that one of the sequences she "ripped off has, um ... I mean, was inspired by FlashDance ", pure genius ... and if you do not laugh your Titty whirls at the end of their" very 80s "Las Vegas show, then you have no bearing bone in the body ... This movie is a cult / camp classic
