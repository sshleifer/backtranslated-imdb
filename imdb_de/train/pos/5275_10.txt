This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film depicting Muslims as PEOPLE, here no stereotypes. This film is determined by history, by acting and above all by its theme of cultural confirmation and discovery. They seem like clich√©s, but at least they are not in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely amazing and the public gets a glimpse of one side of the Muslim world that is rare in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and devoted. What a welcome and overdue departure from the usual negative representations of the Arabs. Excellent movie.
