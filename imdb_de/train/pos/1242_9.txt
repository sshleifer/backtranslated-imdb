I love this movie. It is well written and played and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great scenery and beautiful locations. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and Murphy does a particularly good job in representing the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I was interested in what happened to these people and although the outcome was quite predictable (the good guys win, the hero wins.) The amazingly attractive girl and the holy child save lives - who does not see that? ), it still made me happy when everything went well in the end. Thankfully, the dignity of this movie was never ruined with a shitty sequel. Grab popcorn, cuddle up on the couch and watch this entertaining, happy and entertaining movie.
