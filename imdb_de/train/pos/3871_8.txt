Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in a crowded 19th century Jewish ghetto in England. It is surrounded by threatening, oppressive, dreary, bare bricks architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, darkened windows and hordes of black-and-brown, shrouded crowds. She lives in a small apartment with her large family, which operates a clothing store within the apartment. As a child she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed, and was silent to ward off the mockery of her mother and her siblings, who had made her look ridiculous because she had been imitated out of boredom. <br /> <br /> Young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical lifting, sluggishness and sluggishness, exudes an expressionless, expressionless expression, dressed in plain, unobtrusive clothing and Dwarfs are constantly besieging the gray, mundane, massively imposing buildings and narrow streets and narrow corridors and narrow doors as well as her noisy mother and her siblings and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family. <br /> <br /> Only her form of spiritual escape is the Yiddish theater. Sitting on the balcony, in the first row, leaning over the railing, there is a wide space between her mind and the stage, a space in which she can breathe, think, feel, and yearn. Nevertheless, the freedom of thought that the open stage offers Esther, her face and body remain sleepy, listless and dispassionate. <br /> <br /> The simple and common-looking Summer Phoenix brilliantly depicts Esther's emotionless behavior - Summer / Esther does not convey every desire to want or anticipate. <br /> <br /> After an unusual, explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther decides to finally free herself from the murky life in which she is trapped. <br /> <br /> She is cast in smaller roles in some stage plays, and he meets Nathan Quellen, portrayed by British actor Ian Holm, who teaches Esther the technical skills of acting. From this point, Esther begins a grueling journey that requires learning how to behave and how to feel. <br /> <She begins to experience feelings she has never experienced before, and she gains the experience she needs to fully understand and use the technical aspects of acting. Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional aspects of steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-hatred, etc .; She then goes through these feelings in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, says Nathan: the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react, and the truth A character and an actor are not the same person. These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct the defense of Esther and lead her to two edifying experiences in the dissolution of the film that mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement and emotions. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film that, with its quirky and narrow camera shots, a lackluster photo direction that conveys the ghetto's realistic, dull backdrop, and the lack of character of Summer Phoenix and bland and unsightly portrayals, the Kahn's mental and physical hethics, lethargy and dullness shines. <br /> <br /> A must-have movie for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who value minimalist ilms and character studies.
