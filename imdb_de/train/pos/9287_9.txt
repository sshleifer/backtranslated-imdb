Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to participate in a World Cup qualifier between Iran and Bahrain. When caught, they are held in an area where the game remains within earshot but out of sight. The prisoners ask for dismissal, but rules are rules. Given the lineage of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to conclude that offside is a comedy and often comic. In The Mirror, The Panahi presents two versions of the Iranian girls in 1997 and lets the audience wonder which one is the "real one". In 2000, several Iranian women appeared outside the system. Their transgressions are different, but they all end in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> If you think about Offside now, it's hard to imagine anything but comedy to be ridiculous.

They are just football fans and patriots, and although they are clearly treated unfairly, they never lose focus on the game and the historic victory the nation has under control.
