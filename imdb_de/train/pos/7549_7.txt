A young cat tries to steal his brother's soul from death, but only gets half of it and then has to go on an adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm not sure what's going on in this movie, which is filled with very strange, very surreal images that some parents might be bothered with (ie, the cats cut off a part of a pig who is traveling with them and frying like bacon all three eat). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie that some have compared to Hello Kitty on acidity, I think it's more like Hello Kitty like Dali. (Certainly this is more alive than Destino, which was based directly on his work.) <br /> <br /> If you choose a very unusual movie that challenges your perception of things, then watch this movie. Just be ready for some very strange pictures that will be burned forever in your memory. <br /> <br />
