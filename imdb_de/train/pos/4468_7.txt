Two sailors are on leave - the ladies' man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There are more, but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and healthy - gets annoying pretty fast. This movie is way too long. It's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a stupid story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Nevertheless, it is worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson sing, it becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you do not care. It was recorded in rich Technicolor with all the brilliance that MGM had. Acting is okay - Kelly is doing well (though he sees him as a lady-man, she's pushing) and Sinatra is just great (though HIM also saw him as a shy guy pushing her!). Grayson has nothing to do but she is unbelievably beautiful to look at. Some pictures of her literally took my breath away! There are many highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's great dance and song number; Sinatra sings everything; Grayson's two songs and the well-known animation sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also makes a funny cameo. There's also little Dean Stockwell stealing every scene he's in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the conspiracy does not last, but it's still worth a visit. This was a great success in his time.
