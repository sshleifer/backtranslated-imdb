I met this movie during the annual sale on the sidewalk at the local video store. Scanning thousands of videos in hopes of finding a few cartoons for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work to buy this movie. You see, I have a sibling group of three foster children (to be adopted soon) living with my family. Immediately, my foster children made a connection with the three children who starred in the movie. The film helped them understand their own circumstances better. For the first time, the eldest of the sibling group (7 years / female) decided to learn a bit about their past and their trauma. She fought the whole question of trust. This was also the first time I saw her crying. After watching the movie, I asked her what it means for a child to be adopted. She answered, "It means to be happy." A must for families who promote children and consider adoption. It certainly opened the communication lines with us.
