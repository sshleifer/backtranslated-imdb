Good, funny, uncomplicated story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). This was a good "vehicle" for someone who is familiar with comedy and drama since both contain elements. A romantic comedy about two thrillers, great final lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth About Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they are too implausible. Ebert has not commented on that yet. The great "screwball" comedies were obviously totally implausible ("educate baby", etc.). If you've seen an implausible comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people from the 1930s are ready to move on. Strange. Birthday Girl is a movie I have enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be the "killer app" for home videos.
