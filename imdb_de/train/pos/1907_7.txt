8 Simple Rules is a fun show, but there are also some lessons in life, especially a mature lesson on how to move on from a defeat that Paul died on, the first episode I watched ABC's show. The Hennessy clan - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - are looking for the death of Paul (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) help. I'm glad they chose David Spade later in season two of the show, since he's done the NBC series Just Shoot Me. But all this show is pretty good. This show reminds me of the classic family sitcoms of the '80s and' 90s that used to be on ABC.
