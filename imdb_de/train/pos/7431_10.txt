I am and was very excited about the movie. It was my favorite movie from 1976. Growing up in the 70s, I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson's looks and behavior. Of course, I'm not a film critic, but it was very good for the time. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I have seen the movie many times and still love them as Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Kris and see him in concert if I can. What a talented singer, songwriter, not to mention, actor. I have seen him in many movies, but still think of a star born.
