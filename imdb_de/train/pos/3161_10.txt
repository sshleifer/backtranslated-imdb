I actually started watching the show until it came to FX. I was bored and had nothing to see and saw that the reruns of the show had a premiere. So I decided to look at it. I was so excited that I did not see the show when it first aired on TV. I loved the show so much! Finally a show for all who enjoy it. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay but just not funny enough. They made silly jokes and laughed at things that were just stupid, but not the act of 70s show. The 70s show was funny, smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever and I am so sorry that it came to an end. Although I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. I still love this show and I hope the TV produces more shows like this.
