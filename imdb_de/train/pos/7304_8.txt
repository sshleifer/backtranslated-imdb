Every now and then, a movie advertises as scary or frightening, though this is not usually the case. Most modern horror movies fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are films in which tension and adrenaline not only flow through your veins stronger than usual. They actually scare you to a level you have never experienced before. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a movie. There are so many risks that most movie producers would be scared off. But almost all work. "Halloween" is impressive in its simplicity and altogether terrifying. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysits on Halloween night, while a madman is released after escaping from a psychiatric hospital after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the maniac, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the native population, and finally, he comes to Laurie. <br /> <br /> Sound familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher with stupid teenagers and bloody blood. No chance. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli fits perfectly into his review of "Halloween:": "Halloween has often been grouped with all the other Splatter movies that populate the theaters all over the country 1970s and early 1980s, although Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern Slasher genre, it's not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He has a point and for a number of reasons. First of all, it is almost scary, while most entries in the teen slasher genre are stupid gore festivals (you could argue that many of the youngest of them are funny, but most fail). Second, there is almost no violence (it is very little bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not scary at the moment, and he relies very little on it (the number of bodies is actually quite low). In fact, it can be argued that this is not really a horror film, at least not by today's standards, that most deaths can be stuffed into a single movie, each one Gorig and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for fear and skill. Third, while some characters do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not do them because they are stupid. The characters are real people. Instead of believing that the characters are dying because they are idiots, we are afraid because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is so scary is because it's so easy to believe it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural, there are no ridiculously creative plot elements or "inventive" murders or anything else. Instead, all settings and camera work (saving the opening sequence) are easy. Carpenter is currently putting the camera on and saying action. What we get is the feeling that a murder is actually taking place right in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the most difficult to make movies to do something scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a hit-or-miss game. So, if I told you all of Carpenter's good ideas (which I'm not), then they seem primitive (especially since they were repeated over and over with less effect) through the years). <br /> <br /> Trading here is not a plus as it does not have to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicting characters. The actors behave like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception is who plays The Shape or is later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary if a person does not say anything and simply kills, but it's hard to get to (and even more difficult to prevent people from asking why). But the guy does it, and the result is scary. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's film through and through. He directed it, wrote it together, co-produced it, and wrote the frightening score. This is a man of brilliance, and his later film "The Thing" supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has fallen dramatically as the incentive of big money is being used for less freedom once big producers "realize their potential". As good as this film is, it is not without defects. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the fears work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, there's no reason to fear "The Shape". Fortunately, Carpenter usually uses this time to establish a relationship between the characters and the audience. There is no intimacy in this relationship, but it suits the purpose. We get to know the characters, but not so much that it's daunting when they die. But once the movie arrives on Halloween night, Carpenter puts things in high gear and NEVER stops until you come to the end. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" may be flawed, it's just a bit. It's an immensely frightening movie and a must for anyone who loves spooky movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare your hell out!
