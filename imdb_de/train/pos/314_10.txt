This show is a great story. It has everything from slavery, the way they were treated, the religion, the way the Jews were submerged, the Inquisition, the belief in the Orisha, the African gods, how women were treated, including the daughters , Even to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined, and this violante, that character makes me sad. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I'm so glad they decided to retweet it to t.v. once again. I would like to see the unedited version. Xica has become my heroine. I see her use her power to help all who seek her. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people in this century. I'm looking forward to my Xica every night. It would be great to dub it in English so Americans can love it too.
