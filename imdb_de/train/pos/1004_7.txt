After a brief prologue depicting a masked man necking an elderly gentleman on an abandoned, urban turn of the century Australian street and then slicing his neck, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they chase the house go . They manage to get a loan for a Fixer Upper on a posh street in Sydney, but it turns out that physical deterioration is not the only problem in their new home. It can only be tracked. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable, if somewhat cliched story with a good to average sense of Catherine Millar to a slightly above average shocker. <br /> <br /> The biggest shortcomings seem partly due to the budget, but not completely excusable for this hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening "thriller scene" offers some interesting editing options. Still images and series of still images are used to hide the fact that there is not much to do. Suspense should be created from stagings, not "fix it in the mix" techniques. There is a great atmosphere in the scene, from the surroundings, the lighting, the fog and so on, but the camera should follow the killer and the victim slowly and move from one to the other as we walk down the street and they show increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts have to be slow. The attack had to be longer, clearer and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feel and a low budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene, we move into the present and the flow of the film improves considerably. The story has many similarities with The Amityville Horror (1979), though the budget requires a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett create many creepy, scary scenarios that are often dramatic in nature and not geared for special effects, such as the mysterious man who takes away the old iron plates that were bizarrely attached to an interior wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of the movie might be a little realistic drama. At least in the first half hour of the movie, it's all about Julie and Peter trying to arrange the house financing and then get set up. But Morphett writes a fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is good enough that it's often as exciting as the more traditional thriller aspects that come later - especially if you've gone through similar efforts and tried to buy your own home. <br /> <br /> As soon as they get it If the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. The performances help to create tension. There is no excess of death and destruction in the movie - there is an abundance of nightmares for home repairs. But no threat is really the point. <br /> <br /> It's about human relationships. There are a number of character sheets that are very interesting. The house exists rather as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it sour and possibly destroy it. That it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship exists between two successful yuppies shows that these problems are not just affecting those who can blame them with external suffering, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from an aspiring business associate with "normal" work-friendly friendships to someone more desperate as he becomes subversive, trying to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how shallow these professional friendships can be. Julie undergoes an almost verbal nervous breakdown, but eventually finds release as she frees herself from her failed romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row never surpasses their TV lumps, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. Who likes ghost house films, psychofilms or horror / thriller with a little more metaphorical depth, should have a lot of fun here. It's definitely not worth spending $ 30 on a DVD (which was the price my local PBS station demanded after a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth it a loan and it is definitely worth it to look for free.
