I saw Soylent Green in 1973 when it was first released, and perhaps eight times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite science fiction and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater in Los Angeles had a Charlton Heston retrospective with twelve films. I flew from outside the country for a period of two days and saw six of the films. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From the opening montage to the after-home scene to the great ending, the movie was fantastic. Charlton Heston, a policeman who lives in a dog food dog world and has few natural resources and no understanding of how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past, is great. <br /> <br /> Your chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better in a 35 mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the Cinematoraphy, the writing, the music used and everything about it works. The film is also very strong in its bleak and possible future perspective. Just think about how the world population grew, the rainforest disappeared, the resources had been used up and the greenhouse effect had been getting worse since 1973. I'm just wondering why this movie has not been played in theaters over the years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputation, people often talk as if Charlton Heston is not a good actor. See him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee. I am convinced that he is one of our best actors. Of course, he has made over a dozen other great films, and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
