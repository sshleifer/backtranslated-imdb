Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together. The acidity of Willy with the astonished Amnesian Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene, when they meet again in Willy's apartment, is a gem and the final scene completes the film perfectly. As an irascible, half-retired comedian, Walter Matthau gives an outstanding performance, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated drama coupled with his general misunderstanding of what's going on here. The timing of George Burns is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this movie. His calm serenity with desert-dried answers is memorable. Pay attention to the scene in the end, when Al and his daughter ask something from the Spanish janitor and In response - priceless.
