This movie is just great. It is entertaining from start to finish. You will always be at the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this film is highly underrated by the critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of well-trained mountain rescue man Gabe Walker. Together with him, Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie is played on a mountain with a lot of bad guys makes space for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
