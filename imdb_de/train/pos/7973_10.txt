Maybe I'm a juice, but this is the cutest movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5 years old and called my eyes out. Between then and now (at the age of 15), I've seen it over 25 times and sobbed each one of them. Do not worry, they are tears of happiness! And it's not all juice! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. Usually the whole animal thing can be a huge resistance, but in this movie that's not the case. My only advice: Even if you love that - do not see the Sequal ... bullshit! I suggest that everyone check that ... you will not regret it, no matter how old or young you are!
