OK, here's my personal list of top shows from Nicktoons like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All adult / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a youth robot <br /> < br /> 3. Intruder Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a word in uppercase only? This means that this is the nick show that I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple yet great animated comedy about three wealthy cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get into weird and REALLY surreal situations, from trying themselves Taking care of root beer at Human Kimberely's slumber party, or saving a planet of snails from the evil spaceship. This is a nick show where you will sooner or later tickle your funny bone! The title song is catchy and memorable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the Seinfield franchise - bring the characters to life with very peculiar personalities. The stories are pleasing (the episodes of the fans would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And the humor is all in the style of Earthworm Jim. <br /> <br /> In summary, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which are very popular in just 3 seasons or less around the world.
