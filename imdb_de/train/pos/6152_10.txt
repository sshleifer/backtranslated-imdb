Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I've loved this movie for over 35 years because it's so inventive, smart and funny. Despite the stupid "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialogues are magical and funny. Could you have selected someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not imagine anyone better suited for this role. To recreate this classic would be as stupid as Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though he has only a few high-quality film roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a strange genius who is often forgotten nowadays. Bloating, primitive and decent Englishman - no one could make Slapstick as good as he did. It would be tragic to re-shoot this film because Tomlinson died a few years ago and no one could step into his position to bring justice to his character. The dancing nightgowns and the armor have a magical aura Other films with witches just do not capture. I especially enjoy the places where the Germans invade Eglantine's house, and she has to defend it in every way she can. <br /> <br /> At the bottom of the beautiful, salty sea, hop. Richard and Robert Sherman have surpassed the musical numbers. Everyone is fantastic and worth remembering. Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still lasts today !!
