I think I got this movie when I was young. I remembered how I had seen it as a kid, but I could never find the movie. I remembered the good old Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the greedy, King Koo Koo. I was looking for this movie and still no luck. But one day, when I moved home from my childhood, I found it. We were reunited. I'm 17 years old now. I still watch it. The whole time actually. It's one of the funniest and most touching movies I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally, I think they should do a sequel. Mmm, yes, a sequel. Now I'm even considering tattooing the captain's bird somewhere on my body!
