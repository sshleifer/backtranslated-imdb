Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer Vs. Kramer combined with the idea of ​​Pan's Labyrinth. Even the initial special effect seems to mention Pan's Labyrinth. However, this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago, and in this way she has even more resonance today. In Jake's Closet is about a boy, an only child, which is practically and in the summer holidays alone has to do with the collapse of his family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. When looking for a slasher, this is not your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and exciting and provides a good drama, this is the movie for you. At the show I saw, I swear that there was a moment when the entire audience was screaming. I definitely recommend this movie.
