It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya again, what he does best. A story that revolves around a marriage. It feels good to have a movie in which there is no scene that you would not see with your family. Although the story is simple and contains no new elements, the movie still appeals to you very well because of the presentation, the performances and the overall treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film is about the fact that commitment leads to love. The presentation of the changes in mindset and behavior as soon as you get involved is excellent. The director has definitely given a lot of thought, and the actors have done it to perfection. Although the movie is slow, you do not mind because you are so involved in the story that you just want to watch the joy of watching this new movie fianc√© couple. As a typical RajShree stuff, it has a lot of sentimental scenes that are likely to make the viewer cry (especially ladies). But when you come out of the cinema, you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth it :-).
