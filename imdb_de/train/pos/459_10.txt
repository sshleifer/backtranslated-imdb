This is the best series of this kind I have seen all year round. I can not help but think that it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant flow of cookie-goers is always endless. <br /> Reasons why new tricks succeed are many. The scripts are good and the mix of characters outstanding. The acting is first class and the mixture of comedy and drama is a treat. The stories are not so memorable, but that's not why I watch such programs. <br /> <br /> The title song is a favorite and we were disappointed that it is not available in any published issue. Great stuff, BBC - a triumph of the sense of sex appeal (apart from the young cop no one is there for a feast, and even if he is IS, he can still act!).
