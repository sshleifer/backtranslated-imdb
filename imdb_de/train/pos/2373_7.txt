Pendragon Pictures 'new movie "H G Wells' War of the Worlds", the first true-to-original adaptation of the original, has been in development for about 5 years. A movie release was scheduled for early this year (March 2005), but this never happened. The DVD was released coinciding with the release of Spielberg's version, which will be released on cinemas on June 29th. <br /> <br /> I liked this film with certain reservations. <br /> <br /> How faithful is the adaptation? Wells' book is not 100% true, but 90 - 95% are good enough for me. At least some scenes were completely new, such as Ogilvy, the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer / narrator, who drank awkward tea with his cousin. On the whole, however, this film follows the book very closely - certainly much more than the classic version of George Pal from 1953. <br /> <br /> His biggest mistake is that he obviously made a very cheap budget has been. The majority seems to have been turned blue and composed of digitally rendered backgrounds. This is especially annoying in most indoor scenes and scenes of crowded streets in the city. The Surveys of 1898 London act like a video game. Many scenes in horse-drawn carriages were faked - I think they could not afford to hire a horse. The only scenes that were shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or woods. <br /> <br /> But within those budget constraints, they could accomplish quite a bit. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are pretty well made and correspond to the descriptions of Wells. The heat beam has particularly impressed me. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should be a highlight of the movie, is very disappointing. It's a pity that they could not afford more current sets or better quality animations. <br /> <br /> The acting and directing wins no Oscars. Mostly they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is also pretty good, if not with one of the great Hollywood composers. In fact, I am glad that there was no theatrical release, because the budget limit would have made it look a lot worse on a big screen. From today's point of view, I would rate this as a BBC TV adaptation of classical literature. <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks: Most scenes are shown with different color filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but is used very unevenly and seems to be rather a sloppy task of mastering the DVD. And the obviously wrong mustache of the writer / narrator mutates from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: is it worth seeing? If you can go beyond the technical and budgetary constraints and go down in history, I think you'll enjoy it, especially if you've actually read the original HG Wells novel. However, if you are easily deterred by cheap production values, it is best to pass this on (unless you are an MST3K fan). However, be forewarned that the movie is running for a full 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching everything in one session. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of War of the Worlds (aka "INVASION") was released on DVD the same month when Spielberg released theaters in the cinemas: http: // imdb. com / title / tt0449040 /. This was done on a budget, but is updated like the Spielberg movie - but it's much better! Jeff Wayne is making an animated feature of his bestselling 1978 album, but that will not be out until 2007.
