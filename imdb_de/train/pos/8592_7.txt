Good for evening entertainment - but the plot did not convince. Garrison's affair with the First Lady was unreal and dispassionate. The president was a cardboard display. And who were the villains? Nothing was sufficiently developed or explained. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole was involved. The villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to make history a bit more reality - hunting and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their roles, Basinger lacked character and in no case could Longoria be an intelligence agent. It could have been a very good movie, but somehow he was missing too many unanswered questions. Disappointing overall despite some very good scenes. And did you use the "West Wing" for the scenes in the White House? - I always expected CJ or Charlie to show up!
