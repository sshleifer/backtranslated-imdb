I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This movie is more than just a documentary (which offers nothing more than cold facts) with long mono / duologists and many charts of air or the Arctic. When you watch this movie you will learn more about our planet than just reading a book. It shows that WE are embedded in the cycle of life. This movie is not just for "environmental fanatics", even if people who want to find a good movie with a message should see it. This movie has taught me that we do not just live on earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
