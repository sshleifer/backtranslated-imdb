I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but first let me quote a few remarkable dialogues, which, please remember, are quite on the lips. Aussies and poms will understand, everyone else, right? <br /> <br /> (Theme Song) "He can sink a beer, he can choose a queer in his latest two-row Bondi gear." <Br /> <br /> (another lyrics) "All pommies are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the e-hole of the universe." (during a television interview on an "artistic program"): Mr. Mackenzie, which artists have impressed you the most since you were in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin 'bull artist! <br /> <br /> (while chatting to a naive young pom girl): Mr. Mackenzie, I assume you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Barry answers) Subscriptions? I have never seen a subscription in my life. Mom does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) around us. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the weird farce of this Aussie Aussie strip. If you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy it.
