I had waited a long time for this movie since I saw the trailer that saw it as a political drama with three of my favorite actors. Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although led by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, he and Pacino combined SEA OF LOVE, which is among her best works. But disturbances on some level (for starters, some of the original trailer's scenes do not appear in the movie) and changing the sound (subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this perceptible, but by no means as close as possible , <br /> <br /> That's too bad, because I really wanted to have this movie. There was a great potential here to make a film about how the government, despite all its corruption, could still pay off and make a complex statement about this corruption, not the usual good or bad ones. And there is good action here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good and Danny Aiello shows one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, has nothing to do, and though there are advantages in the central storyline, if the movie turns into a thriller, the film loses its way, recovering briefly in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino and then falls at the very end. I wish I could like that more, but no.
