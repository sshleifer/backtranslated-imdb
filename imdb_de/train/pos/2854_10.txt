Much has already been said in this film and I would like to join those who praised it. It is a highly unique film that uses elements from different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without getting confused. In places you only laugh loudly, in other places you feel like the characters whose mistakes and failures you observe. Sabus genius can be shown in relation to some sequences of the movie. For one thing, all three men who pursue each other have an erotic daydream about a young woman they are passing by on the street. This sequence is beautiful and shows the characters of all three runners very well. It's both erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the movie where runners get tired. One of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for somebody is back and you see them both dancing together and in the next shot he dances with himself, which is deeply moving , All runners come to this point where they believe something has been lost or is back on track. And in one part of the movie, they stop chasing each other, running in line and laughing like that. Here it is all the beauty and ridiculousness of what we call the life Sabu shows throughout the movie. His characters fail (or in the end?), But he does not rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues", living up to Sabu's claim to be a genius. Look at it! <br /> <br />
