Jörg Buttgereit sometimes goes a bit too far with his films and themes, also for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically designed and often have a deeper meaning for their themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It's also very difficult to name this movie. It's not really a movie with a story about it, in the sense of beginning, middle and end. It also has no main character, but focuses on 7 different suicides and murders on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are told with a lot of lessons, although some of course are more interesting and realistic than the others. They are not necessarily related, but they still tell a story. The movie does not feel disconnected at all. All different stories have a different feeling, and Buttgereit tells the story without using words (also typical of his style), but instead lets the pictures and the obviously sensual emotions of the characters tell the whole story. It helps to make this movie an effective movie. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are not too high and this could be something that might scare off some people. However, for this film it is helpful to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark, disquieting and depressing themes br /> 7/10
