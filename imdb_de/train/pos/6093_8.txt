I've just previewed this movie and all I can say is ... "What was I watching ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The story is really simple. Stiller and Black are playing friends / neighbors. Stiller is the focused hardworker, while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that clears Poo. The idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black takes and the fact that he is still Stiller's best friend makes Stiller go crazy with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is just weird. The direction is odd, with a strange rotating aperture that shoots sequences shot from nowhere. The dialouge and the acting are very strange. strange in a wide way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, from the weird "Envy" song that keeps coming up, to the scene where you think you're listening to a classic 80s song, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <br /> So the real question is ... is weird funny? That depends solely on the individual. I broke with the filthy humor of the movie. After the show, I heard that people called it terrible listless and happy it was free. Strangely, I understood their point of view. There are no jokes, so if you are not fascinated by the uniqueness of the whole, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This film is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I suggest you see it. If not, flee from this movie. It will only make you angry.
