According to John Ford's lyrically shot fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life, his biggest failings may have been female mutilation and the ability to dance in the "worst way". Ford's camera has only praiseworthy views to show Mr. Lincoln's early life. But what the film lacks in character complexes makes up for it in beauty and depth of field. Exceptionally beautiful compositions of the early film, which could consist of a series of beautiful statues, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln at a discount, one of his best roles. The film is about two young men, brothers who were tried for a murder that they both allegedly committed. In the classic, angry mob style, the city decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the two until the honest Abe steps into the fight. He enchants her with his humor and tells them not to rob him of his first big fall and that they are as good as being lynched with the boys' lawyer. What follows seems to be the outline for all the court murder dramas, as Abe interrogates Witnesses for the rapture and humor of the judge, the jury, and the city before he encounters the missing links. The movie runs like many John Ford movies: a Tablespoon of Americana, a touch of moderate predictability, a touch of sarcasm that you're not sure whether you use the recipe or if Ford has done it himself. Despite the film's apparent Hollywood feel and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and pleasantly well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.
