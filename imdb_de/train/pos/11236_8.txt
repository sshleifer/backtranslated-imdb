For the protocol I am in no way connected to the production. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie with the most episodes ever made. Over 7 seasons (this is the last one) they have produced about 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad performance for almost no budget and everyone volunteers time and energy. <br /> <br /> According to their own statements, the previous seasons do not have as good production qualities as the later ones, but with progressive effect the effects, the green screen work and the acting are improved. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "immerse" so started from the beginning and looked all the way through. HF profits from story arcs as well as the best science fiction and fits in well with the Star Trek universe it is in. Characters and "relatives" from the original series have been included in the stories, contributing significantly to the sense of the stories and sometimes improving the characters over the original. <br /> <br /> All the experience includes an excellent web site, Blooper Roles, a high-profile forum frequented by many actors and production staff, and a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for high-resolution, high-budget productions, you probably will not. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for more adventures in the Star Trek universe, stories that credit Star Trek and make you think, this is one.
