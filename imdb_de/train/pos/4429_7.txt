Personally, I found the movie pretty good, very good acting by Tadanobu Asano from Ichi the Killer. I really can not say much about the story, but there were parts that were a bit too confusing, and overall I just found the movie too long. Apart from that, however, the film contained great acting skills and many of the locations were beautifully filmed, with great effects and a lot of swordplay. In my opinion another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano. Well, I can not really say anything about the movie anymore, but if you are only dealing with Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers in Asian cinema, I would suggest that you try to lend it. I would say that in your collection this must be very good Japanese movie.
