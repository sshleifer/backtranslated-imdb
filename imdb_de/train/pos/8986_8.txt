Anton Newcombe makes the movie and he is the main topic. Watching him open a song, if not an entire album would quickly prove the guy a real talent. He thinks he is God, but is so wonderful and interesting. The DW are in comparison musically or otherwise not really that interesting. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton tells the cameraman: "Now let's pawn this guitar!". Great use of archive / home video material. It's great to see that rock documents are still being made. A cool document about the creative process. If you like this, visit Nirvana Live! This evening! Sold out! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
