The man in flames was hot. I love a classic fairy tale of good old revenge and what can be better felt as revenge than kidnapping an innocent girl. <br /> <br /> The authors have done an excellent job in this film to explore the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that viewers can truly understand and feel that Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a choirboy type who tried to save Pita through the "right" channels, but used torture tactics and street smarts. Some may say, "Torture is always wrong," and you may be right, but when you see the pain Creasy is experiencing through the loss of Pita and the sheer passion that he has to get her back, you can not help it with Creasy and pull him for even more merciless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy in dealing with the various nefarious gangsters and criminals, and he knew that. Creasy's search ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy's death in the bad guy's car. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, he actually improved it by showing that Creasy was ready to die to get Pita back. His death was indeed noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel does a great job, just like the authors. This movie deserves good grades because it was definitely a good movie.
