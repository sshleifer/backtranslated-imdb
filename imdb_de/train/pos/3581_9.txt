I had seen this movie back in the 80's and had almost forgotten it when I noticed that he was back on TV watching him. I remembered that I liked this little sleeper at first sight, and I liked him even better at the second sight. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy responsible for the accidental death of his older brother) are outstanding. The film feels very authentic - an unobtrusive, calm, deeply moving story of a family that hurts from grief. The dialogue is frugal, but enlightening, and nonverbal action is excellent. A bit of a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People without a psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. The Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy that comes with it.
