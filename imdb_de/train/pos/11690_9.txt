I really wanted to see this movie. Well, it has taken so far to decide to actually rent it. It was absolutely worth it. This movie made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny, no matter what movie he is in. However, this should almost be his best. If you are looking for a family movie, ie pre-teens and more, then you can not ignore it.
