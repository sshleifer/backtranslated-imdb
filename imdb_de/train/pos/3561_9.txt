At least, something good came from Damon Runyon's false attempt to sentimentalise the mafia. "Guys and Dolls", the seemingly indestructible stage musical, was recorded in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful, entertaining movie that included an All-Star cast including Vivian Blaine (from the original) Broadway -Show), Jean Simmons (whose character bears a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the great gentlemen of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, who both recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ("From Here To Eternity ") and Best Actor (" On the Waterfront ") and were at the top of their game. You can hear Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight", volumes about where Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who shuts down the house with "Sit Down You Rocking the Boat." Omnipresent Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his villain's onscreen gangster gallery. The film looks bright and cartoonish and anticipates the Pop Art of the early 1960s. The figures speak a stylized patois, which is obviously based on Yiddish idioms. Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are outdated, it's all a lot of fun, and even the gentle joking of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real hostility to organized religion. Seeing Sinatra and Brando alone in the same movie is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has many other attractions to offer in the 149 minutes.
