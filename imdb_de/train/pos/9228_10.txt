Expecting another Nunsploitation film with a bad mother abusing and torturing her allegations, it turned out that Flavia was much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> It actually has a feminist plot, even though I do not believe such a term existed in the time the movie plays. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very oppressed and tied to deserted places in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she simply can not sit there and actually does something about it, albeit with catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> The advance performance sequence has Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield. She sees an injured "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she can, her hateful father beheads the soldier and waves her head (big family dynamics, huh?). Afterwards, she forces her father to join a monastery in which she witnesses more injustice. Although scenes include violence, rape, and nuns, I would call this a historical drama rather than a nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are many of the ingredients for a trashy recycle, but acting, camerawork, action, and music are too good to keep up. Most of the "Nun" films I've ever seen have the following basic premise: A good girl ends up in a convent, where the matron is the ultimate slut who loves whipping and / or her Making Life Go To Hell br /> <br /> Flavia spends much of the first part of the film, passively questioning all the atrocities that are happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she's the most energetic (but a little crazy - she loves to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not crouch like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as liberators (the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim intruder, who spits on dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia to her violent crusade against those who oppressed her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover lets her down at a very bad time. I do not want to give too much away from the rest of the story, but I'm prepared to be shocked, devastated and sad at the end. This is a great movie, so do not be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash. And how could a movie go wrong with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli? I'm not familiar with Mar√≠a Casares's other works, but Sister Agatha is a damned character. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of great reviews on the release of Synapse (USA), but I love my German X-Rated cult DVD copy. It is not anamorphic / 16: 9, but it has slightly more image information than Synaps Release on all edges. <br /> <br /> And there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many by Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God male? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit? are all male! " -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are scared, look at them, sister, afraid they will lose their power!" -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christians who have fled after the arrival of the Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going, the Muslims can not do you anything that the Christians have not done! Ha Ha Ha!" -Sr. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Muslims for frightening these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you only need the sight of a Muslim to make you a hiker for your underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a fleeting nun, and the idea for the film came from events that culminated in what was happening during the Musalman invasions of Italy still remembered today as the Martyrdom of 800 in Otranto "
