How powerful and captivating simple film quality can be. This film tells its story with everyday scenes that manage to awaken the hidden power within. It is true, as others have said, how this film makes it really clear how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, exaggerated emotionalism, and climatic endpoints, and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story with simple realism. So much of what these characters go through is implied by the scene and not described in verbose dialogue. One aspect I really enjoyed about the film was the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom was very openly expressed in his childlike way and the other was totally stoic, but both were able to trigger deep emotions. The older brother had, as usual, little to say, it was all in his dead face! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, good direction! Not to miss!
