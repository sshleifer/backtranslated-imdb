Short, but long enough, cat soup is a very wild excursion. One day I just searched my on-demand list through the anime section and found it and decided to look at it. I spent all this time basically with my jaw agape. The whole time I was either empty or had a fleeting thought, the "TURN IT OFF !!!" yelled. But I did not do it. And actually, I am glad that I did that. <br /> <br /> The animation is breathtaking. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally loved it for the amazing animation, but the seemingly vacant story behind it is just as convincing to me. <br /> <br /> A little boy - well, cat - goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part, she lies ill in bed and is soon paid for by a visit from a kind of grim reaper. Her soul is divided in half. One is recovered by the cat boy, while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie is a bit lost for me, honestly. I assume they are going back, and their world is ... maybe decaying slowly? Maybe their absence of soul is the answer behind it, because the rest of the movie contains different stages in which the world is. First there is a huge flood, and then it dries up in a desolate desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to both) What is God or fate, as you will see? Then I believe that they find the soul of the sister in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, did not quite understand that, but it always shakes me over the back. <br /> <br /> Although seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind that if you see enough and do some research. Personally, I love trippy stuff like this and would like to spend time just to understand it. But for some people it's probably not their cup of tea. It is very disturbing. So, if you like your direct anime, this is not a movie for you. However, if you are open, I highly recommend this movie.
