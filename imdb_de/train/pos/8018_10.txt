This Muppet movie features Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot College graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical Manhattan Melodies to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will meet with the Muppets. After being rejected by too many manufacturers, Scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on their own. However, Kermit still believes that he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally did it and let everyone know that he sold the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> You'll find many great scenes, including a live action sequence featuring the Muppet Babies, a muppet-filled wedding sequence, including sesame street cast and Traveling Matt (by Fraggle Rock) , Scooter as a moviegoer and a scene in which all this is possible Rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters were no longer included. Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should be some significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in that movie, as he was in the final season of the Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper and Miss Piggy's dog Foo Foo should have been with her as well (Rizzo The Rat, also starred by Steve Whitmire), had a big role in this movie, and he was not well known back then).
