My babysitter was a fan, so I saw many older episodes when I grew up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV on when this show premiered. To my surprise, I found it pleasant. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodging the fans of the other * the tomatoes *, so I like that they focus only on those two. However, this may cause fans of the original shows to hate this. I like the voice, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked to listen to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he really enjoys his job as an actor. The techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play dungeons and dragons or to play scenes from Star Wars (of course not mentioned by these names in the show), I enjoy.
