A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger kids, but it's also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc to his colony as he destroyed the foods that were superior to the grasshoppers. He is banished and has to find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90s. The story is good, but a little more detail would suffice. The voice output is good as with most animated films. The music is nice to hear. Nothing special, but it was nominated for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie was awesome to me. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie with 10/10.
