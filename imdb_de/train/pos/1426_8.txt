I have to say that sometimes "looks" is all that matters, like Jeremy Clarkson from BBC (not about our earth, but he's still right). <br /> <br /> And when it comes down to it, this movie is an incredibly stunning beauty that you'll absolutely love what your eyes will see. <br /> <br /> And then there is also the personality of the film, interesting, with a captivating narrative voice and a narrator stories that will touch your soul when you see these excellently filmed pictures. <br /> <br /> The film is unlikely to affect your lifestyle and ruin these beauties, but it will certainly remind you how valuable our earth really is. <br /> <br /> This film deserves its 10 stars, as it is one of the few stylistic documentary films I have really enjoyed.
