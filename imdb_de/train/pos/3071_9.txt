Panic delivers the goods ten times with Oscar performances by William H. Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland. In a movie about our decisions and the consequences we live with. Chillingly honest and thought-provoking, Panic is one of the best films Hollywood has produced in years. The effect remains with you after leaving the theater.
