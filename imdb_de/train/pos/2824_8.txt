Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be torn from destiny and our actions like a torrent, resulting in us losing part of ourselves. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl, in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother. Leonora ends homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation of a laid-back woman. In fact, part of her attitude is the bitterness over Rafael's job. <br /> <br /> She returns home to visit her family and finally confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows she's the famous La Brunna, and Garbo plays her role as the diva she really was, and valued her with such cool arrogance in her later depictions. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez is very reminiscent of Valentino in this section, and he was prepared by MGM as a Valentino clone, though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right. He believes in a disagreeable part as weak, strong-willed Mama's boy and can be realistic but funny aging at the end of the film. He does not win Leonora when she returns home. Later, as he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully filmed, with brilliant storm sequences, and the sets that show Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some good secondary performances of classic cars like Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain , <br /> <br /> Although this is a story about lost love and missed opportunities, I do not think Leonora and Rafael would have done this was happy together, as he needed a more traditional woman and she was a career woman, and I believe not that she was happy in a small village. The end is lifelike and does not take any punches. <br /> <br /> See this as Garbo's American movie debut and pioneer of what's to come
