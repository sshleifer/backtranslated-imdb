With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, you can go wrong. Very unusual scenes, especially the modern ones. The realization of modern machinery is very effective. Here you have blasting gun explosions from construction vehicles that help clear the terrain so that new structures can be created. Although she is much younger in this movie, it's not hard to figure out who the future Mrs. Pumphrey from BBC's All Creatures Great and Small series will be! Really effective reappearance of Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The score is by the renowned Swiss composer Artur Honegger and is also unusual. For the time (1936) it looks like they are really used, big sets or the effects make it seem like that. After all, it's a really good story.
