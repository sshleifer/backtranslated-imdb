This is a real "80s movie": back then, they made perhaps 100 times more films than they do today, which makes many of them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Nowadays, perhaps the same people who made cheap "direct video" movies in the 1980s make cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, this is above the middle trash movie level: it has a good and fascinating story, and it's pretty well done, I think. In a scene you can even see the microphone swinging at the top of the screen. Of course, there are also little cameos by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not add much to the movie "success," though they are good in their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer Sammi Curr, really looks awful, especially when he sings. One of the scariest monsters I've seen in horror movie. I may have nocturnal nightmares about him. Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.
