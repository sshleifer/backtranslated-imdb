I would say it was time, this movie was fantastic ... and yes, if you do not feel like becoming a Christian, why should you watch the movie? I saw this movie after I was already rescued and found it very moving. I see now that they have taken these films to another level and created the Left Behind series ... They have a close comparison and are definitely more modern for reaching people. I think, to really judge this movie, you should see it, there are three or four of them in the show, if I'm not mistaken. ! God will bless you if you watch them for that.
