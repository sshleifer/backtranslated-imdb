I have to say that this was not very exciting, but talking about fashion and funny ways to solve a puzzle. A bit too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... that's awesome! I really liked that part of the movie a lot ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter), however, is extremely funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) really seemed hopeless ... he should have been more angry to her, how she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is tour and fashion in bad luck. Anyway, I recommend this movie only for the summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teenage spy films by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... do you remember? She will be fine in this tricky detective work.
