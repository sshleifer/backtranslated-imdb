Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after he runs out of ideas. I can not say much about this movie without revealing the story. I can say that was little, it seems, as if you were looking at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances from all.
