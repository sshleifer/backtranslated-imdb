As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to record as much of the story of my new religion as possible. I was invited to a film screening with my sons and the other young men and women and their family members. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening we drove to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic village of the church. We had reservations at Vistor's Center to watch this movie. Since my film was limited to a few documentary films of the church, I was fascinated. The only "full-length films" of the church that I had seen were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years". Both were in my opinion very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> The missionary interpreted handkerchiefs that said that several people had been moved from this film to tears. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to make me cry." Imagine my surprise when I had to sob! It really is a very moving and inspiring testimony to the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See it and believe in its powerful message!
