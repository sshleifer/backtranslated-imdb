In my opinion, this is much better than either of the two 1990s versions, but still not so good. It feels outdated, probably because it does, but it holds up well compared to other BBC 1980s newspaper pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey's book as one of the two '90s versions, and St. John Rivers at least covered, if not very good. Timothy Dalton is very good as a Rochester, but the actress Jane plays is far too old. There is quite room for a TV adaptation of this length, for which more than a tenth has been spent.
