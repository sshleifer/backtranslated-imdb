Four great stories by Master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors of the early 70s, form the basis of this outstanding Amicus production. This was a kind of movie that was very popular in the sixties to the mid-seventies, and it's one of my favorite types of horror movies. This is particularly true for the episode Sweets to the Sweet, in which Christopher Lee is pursued by his evil little girl, heir to her mother tradition. Great fun from start to finish and good to very good are the other three episodes (with the last something on the comics page, but with Ingrid Pitt, the UK's most famous Vampress show).
