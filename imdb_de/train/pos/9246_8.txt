One of the great mysteries of life that has suffered daily is why cute girls are so often more interested in kicks and heels than in the nice boys. Worse, if the nice guys even want to marry these girls, the girls still prefer the idiots and heels, even after the idiots and heels have shown their contempt, they've just shown that they are the girls are interested. Stu Erwin is the nice guy, who is still nice after he has been lied to and cheated and even after he has completely lost the girl. Clark Gable is the idiot, and he's perfect in the role, a sad touch for his fans. <Jean Harlow looks like a slimmer Mae West, who even sounds like La West in some of her cynical disposable lines. <br /> <br /> Something puzzling is that so many of the other characters you're supposed to be angry with - I mean the hell, they're locked up, they have to - so obviously nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who are in a minority movie or story would be growling and repulsing, but here you can help someone. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe the story is more clich√©, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the audience will be glad to have seen. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors do not get credit. Once again, we can say a big thank you to IMDb.com.
