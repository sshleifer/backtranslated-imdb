Well, I finally found "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after becoming a midnight sensation in 1979. (I'm the latecomer, I'll probably first see the new documentary "Patti Smith" this summer: Dream of Life sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel a bit old-fashioned, and yes, it was worth it This is a very high-energy comedy that features a lot of great music and surprising moments, telling the story of Riff Randell, who is enthusiastically played by PJ Soles, and the fight she and her fellow students make with Vince Lombardi High against her new repressive client, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," pretty much describes Mary Woronov's performance as "Evil Eve Arden.") A typical teenage-against-establishment plot is here with absurdist humor (this exploding Mice, this giant) beefed up mouse, the monitors of the Hansel and Gretel Hall) and some really rousing melodies.Riff is of course the biggest fan of the original nglichen punk band The Ramones, and this band flushes throughout the film from a dozen bakers dozen of their greatest songs, including five at a concert, that's really exciting. In fact, the sight of Riff, furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" on this blowout, may be the funniest moment of the picture. And the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, who later sinks down a street singing "I just want to do something", is pretty exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation, which I think is the wet dream of every schoolchild. Great stuff. By the way, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands I've ever seen in a concert, and I was very pleased that the DVD for this movie contains optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks thought these subtitles were necessary, I wonder ...
