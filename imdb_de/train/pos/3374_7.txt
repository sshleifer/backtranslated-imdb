"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing sci-fi movies of the 70s and still very convincing today. Although they are flawed and a little old-fashioned, the apocalyptic touch and the (then typical) environmental premise are still very disturbing and thought-provoking. The quality level of this film outweighs the majority of contemporary SF films because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classical. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to live, with overpopulation, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the absolute scarcity of all vital food. The only food form available is synthetic and sold by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in great condition) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most outstanding executives, stumbling over scandals and dark secrets ... The script is sometimes overly sentimental and the climax does not really come as a big surprise the atmosphere is still very tense and scary. The uprising sequence is really grueling and easily one of the macabre moments in the cinema of the 70s. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his final role and there is a great (but too modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is science fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable loss to humanity! No fantastic spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
