Minor Spoiler <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful top model who lives in his apartment with attorney Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon). She tried twice to commit suicide twice in the past: for the first time, when she was a teenager, and saw her father cheating on her mother with two women at home and then when Michael's wife died. Since then she has left behind Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment, and with the help of real civil servant Miss Logan (Ava Gardner) she finds a beautifully appointed old Brooklyn Heights apartment for a reasonable rent. She sees a strange man in the window on the top floor of the building, and Miss Logan informs that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest living alone and supported by the Catholic Church. Alison moves to her new location, and as soon as she gets there, she receives a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) welcomes her and introduces her new neighbors. Then he invites Alison in the night to the birthday party of his cat Jezebel. The next day, strange things happen to Alison in her apartment and her health. Alison looks for Miss Logan and learns that she lives alone with the priest in the building. Another investigation shows that all the people she knew in the party were dead criminals. Afraid of the situation, Alison embraces Christ again as Michael investigates the scary events. Alison realizes she lives at the gate to hell. <br /> <br /> Although underestimated in the IMDb user rating, 'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever. I have watched this movie at least six times, for the first time in the seventies, in the cinema. On September 7, 2002, I bought the imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie again. Even after so many years, this movie is still great. The scary and spooky story is scary even today. The cast is a constellation of stars and asterisks. You can see many actors and actresses who became famous at the beginning of their career. Fans of horror movies surely worship "The Sentinel" and I'm one of them. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'A Sentinela dos Malditos' (Obsolete) <br /> <br /> Obs.: On September 2, 2007 I saw this movie again ,
