Shintaro Katsu, best known for the Zat√¥ichi films, plays a major role in this third and final film of Kenji Misumi (mainly for "Lone Wolf and Cub"). The saga of Hanzo 'The Razor'. To rape "ghosts" and reveal shady events in the shogunate treasury. The "conspiracy" of Hanzo somehow became stale and repetitive. What was once a novel in the first movie was not anymore I'm just glad they decided to quit one trilogy (I'm watching YOU Lucas) <br /> <br /> My class: B <br / > <br /> DVD Extras: Trailer for all 3 Hanzo the Razor films only <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima unleashes both breasts, Mako Midori only her left
