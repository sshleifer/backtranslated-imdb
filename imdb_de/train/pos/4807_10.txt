I really thought that this movie is great. Not only is the story true, the style is lush yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrait of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner in which Vicotria became famous (perhaps notorious). The romantic elements of the film are so unadulterated and tender that at the end of the movie you really understand why Vicotria has been mourning Albert for the rest of her days. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are also worth mentioning. I appreciated the beautiful score, which mirrors the dramatic movement of the story. I also found the cinematography excellent, some scenes left me out of breath because of the opulence and splendor that they depict. <br /> <br /> There have been so few movies this year that are as beautiful and tender as this movie and it rates as one of the best 2009!
