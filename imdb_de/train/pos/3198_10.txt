That's how I felt watching this movie. I loved it. It was funny. But I felt like I was taking a sneaky look into someone's psyche and then laughing as it turned to an interesting point. A friend put it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel like we broke into someone's house and are now watching their terrible home videos without their knowledge". <br /> <br /> Another fact is stranger than fiction. "Groovin 'Gary," the original "Beaver Kid," is a small-town person who appears near a TV station, hoping to get into the movie. With high hopes for fame and significance, he invites Harris to film a truly terrifying talent quest he has organized in his hometown - led by his own drag-act "Olivia Newton-Don." <br /> <br /> Director Trent Harris is doing a great job with this slowly evolving story. Some shots of a clumsy child who wants to be someone turns into two other reinterpretations in the story of freedom from the suppressed sexual identity in the small town of America. At the same time, Harris criticizes the attitude of the small town of America, the celebrity cult and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover produce impressive performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely he follows the actual "Gary material," but with strong nuances that reinforce the sense of interaction as desired by Harris. <br /> <br /> In The End of the Big-eyed Naivety of the Original Gary moved me - in contrast to these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie you should not miss. I have not seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
