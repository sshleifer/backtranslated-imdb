Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a little girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their faith every day, and have soon consecrated Azaria to God in their church. Her two older boys are watching. Michael is on vacation and the family decides to drive to Ayer's Rock, one of Australia's most impressive tourist destinations. Since the families are not rich, they store near the place. After a wonderful first day Lindy lets the baby Azaria sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly she hears Azaria cry. As Lindy crashes into the tent, a dingo dog comes out and shakes his head. The baby is gone and soon the dingo. Although the entire camp is looking for the baby, it is not found. Concluding that she is dead and that the dingo has said goodbye to her beloved child, the Chamberlains endeavor to accept the decision of God and continue their lives. But unfortunately the story is being spread sensationally in the news media, and soon the story is spread that Lindy has murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could that happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows that "mob rule" is not a fantasy. The whole country turns against the Chamberlains, partly because they are considered odd. Streep gives her best performance ever, as the complex Lindy, whose own strong-willedness takes every step against her. Neill also does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the biggest ever, with portrayals of people from all over the country bringing Lindy's case closer. The costumes, set design, script, directing and production are at the top of the line. If you've never seen or heard this movie, you can fix it right away. It is not far from the reality to say that this "scream" should be seen by all who are interested in the film and the abusive power of the media.
