In truth, this is not really a "movie" but an extended final episode; By that I mean that you did NOT pursue the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street). I suspect that you would have a hard time tracking this movie produced for the TV movie. "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a TV production that EVERY single-cast member would return many years after his absence to re-portray his characters and close an incredible program. The film expresses this sense of "family", not only in the characters, but also in the actors. It's all very bitter-sweet, knowing that this will be the last time we'll all see them together again under the title HOMICIDE. In terms of story, I found this movie a bit flawed. Giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly fictitious, and I felt that his shooting could be treated as a lieutenant in his regular position. Also, Det. Bayliss's extreme conspiracy that got stuck at the end of the series is finally fixed, but I never felt it was necessary; I enjoyed staying with a mystery (remember that the first case of the first episode remained unresolved for the entire series run!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I can not recommend it to anyone who did not have the slightest attention in the show. Well, if you just put it on DVD ...
