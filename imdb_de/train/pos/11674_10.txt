The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert it was pretty funny to watch them. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is that, to my surprise, Charley dropped out of the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then a miracle correction, but he actually left the race. The most fearful moment of the show must have been when Max was standing in the desert with almost no water or food! The end was great and I was very happy to see that at least one team made it. Overall, not as great as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch as you get a glimpse of the most challenging race in the world.
