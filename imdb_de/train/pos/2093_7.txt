This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it has a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel. In other words, there is much reason to cover. <br /> <br /> It was at times soap operatively, but also had visually dramatic moments, which were limited by a grasshopper attack at the end of the film. That was amazing to see. Considering that this film is about 70 years old, the special effects crew of this film has done spectacular work. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day. Both perform well. The only problem is credibility, as all Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just do not look real. I would like to see a reissue of this movie with only Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but just to make the story seem more believable.
