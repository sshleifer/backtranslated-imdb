I really enjoyed this film about the relationships that sometimes developed between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - and the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando goes from the contempt of the Japanese (which is natural in World War II) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is wonderful throughout. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his touching performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese playing next to him did a remarkable job as well). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it But the movie is a good movie with a box of handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something while being entertaining. A mostly underrated gem.
