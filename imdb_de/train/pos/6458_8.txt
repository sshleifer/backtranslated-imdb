A beautiful film that fundamentally touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and when you see that nothing in this world can really be perfect, that's pretty good. The only minor matter that I objectively reject is the pace in some places in the middle of the story. Acting is also very good, and all actors are easily top actors in high-profile films. The actual director seems to have been well thought out and the script must have been amazing. There are some truly breathtaking moments of foreboding and a fairly circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment the main character gains that sense of heaven, the perfect ending is a really brilliant yarn.
