While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." has no really important qualities, it is still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein and tries to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics PhD student Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). The funniest scene is likely when Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he looks like a French Impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously little of it The film is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It is nothing but a light comedy, in contrast to Robbin's most famous 1994 movie, The Shawshank Redemption. A film about Einstein's entire life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and spoke against nuclear weapons (he came to the point where the FBI arrived has kept a file about him). <br /> <br /> So this file is acceptable anyway. With Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
