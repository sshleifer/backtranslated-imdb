I found this movie a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest, announces that he is HIV, the reactions of the family members alone and with each other were touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; still so likely that they shout at each other. I did not understand why the family felt that the youngster could not handle the news, but after I had this difficult time behind me, I found this film moving through. <br /> <br />
