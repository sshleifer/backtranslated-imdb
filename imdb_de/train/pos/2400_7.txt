I see what my ancestors saw in the youthful bed of Davis. She is great in this almost insane political comedy, in which Warren Williams stands as a political agent who is constantly behind his entertaining. Vivienne Osborne is as brilliant as his ex, and I have chosen her again and again. The Williams character is not likeable at all, and he is not even a decent Op. Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. When a candidate at a political rally was awakened from sleep and appointed governor to prevent a rival's candidacy, all this chaos is carried by internal political warfare in a party called the "progressive party." If you think politically, you're likely to see a different party than the one you're connected to, and it's reflected in the fictitious "Progressive Party" by Williams and Kibbee. I could draw accurate parallels, but we're not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever seen one of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll see Frank McHugh as Williams's right arm, looking and behaving like Bert Wheeler. He let me be fooled. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
