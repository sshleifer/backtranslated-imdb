Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is pretty much the most perfect example of a giallo I've ever seen, blending all the necessary elements into an eerie stew. Most importantly, and of paramount importance to me, it has a complex, curvy storyline that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer does not come out of the left field here at the end. The story that concerns a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the movie's title, right?), Which seemingly concerns the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy about two sisters, is one about the killer and the killer is red camouflage figure with the insane laughter of a madman, is scary and memorable. For every great Giallo, there are some beautiful leading ladies, and here's a whole selection, led by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Danning as a relish tramp in Barbara's fashion house. Another necessary component of a superior giallo is a catchy, summing score, and Bruno Nicolai delivers one for this movie, which should stay with you for days. Beautiful landscape? Check it again. The picture was shot mostly in WÃ¼rzburg and is a real feast for the eyes. OK, OK, but what about these murders? Is not that what Gialli is about? Well, I am pleased to report that most of the viewers should be pleased with the various knives, shootings, sharpenings, and other slaughters that this movie spits out tastefully. Not to mention the crypts, the crazy dream sequence, rats and bats (and many of them too!), The drug names, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and in the person of Ugo Pagliai a handsome leading actor for the female audience. As I said, a perfect giallo. Better yet, this DVD is from the fine people of No Shame, and you know what that means: a beautiful print and tons of extras! Thanks, people!
