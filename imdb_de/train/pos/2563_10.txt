I've seen some comments here on southern-accented Brando, some of which felt it was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination in the South were very strong. The Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Civil rights were still in their infancy. Could this possibly have been a subtle social comment, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? In the same way, MASH was a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War. Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made that Myoshi Umeki appears "cold". Anyone who was in Japan would understand. The Japanese people did not tend, at least in my experience, to express emotions in front of strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who meet single women. Americans in Japan were completely alien to this culture and the dull attempts to meet women shocked the ladies. A feature of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassing or uncomfortable, which many American soldiers considered a sign that their progress had been welcomed. Remember also that Japan was just defeated at the time shown in the film and the occupation forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki has provided a very credible account of her situation. Seeing her interaction with American actors brought back memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet a pair of pretty young ladies who, after convincing them that I was not the typical American, taught me their language and culture during their time in their country.
