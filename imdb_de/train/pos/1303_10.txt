Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago, when they founded a trio called "Cream". It was the psychedelic days of England and America, and these people looked like this: everything thin, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was mostly good. <br /> <br /> Well, these people are now 60 years old and can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disk shows us. Of course, I was always very familiar to Clapton, who was never out of the limelight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, whom I had not seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so thin he looked like a speed freak. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drumming was solid. Bruce looked a bit choppy, but his voice is great, as good as ever, and it's a pleasure to hear those old songs. This is just great material and performance from guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this show as unobtrusive. I do not agree with it. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song "Spoonful" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
