This is a wonderful movie about the Mormon struggle and its final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly powerful and the message is one that we all need to be reminded of - God does not speak, but he communicates, if only we would listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors of Katrina in New Orleans and the surrounding area, I was particularly moved by the Mormons who had to leave everything after Joseph Smith was assassinated. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution and yet they could not. The Mormon struggle to cross the country, the cost of life and the hardships they suffered were truly impressive, demonstrating their tremendous strength. As far as the actual Mormon faith is concerned, this is not very important, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not a core piece of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is first-rate, even if others do so. Commentators know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the representations were. But as an actor, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, all the script they've given make them outstanding. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily stand alone (and certainly does today), Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to get viewers to the cinemas to see a movie about the Mormons. The power as a young Mormon is wonderfully beautiful, and Darnell as Zina is not a Mormon, but remains with the family after her father is killed. Power does not have much to do until the end of the movie when he has a big scene, and Darnell (another teenager at the time of filming) has even less, though they make a lovely couple. Her fate remains unclear regarding her conversion, and one wonders about the polygamy in her case. However, you can not beat one for eye candy.
