I've never bothered to see this movie in theaters, though I remember hearing that name over and over again. I finally watched it this week and what a pleasure. For some reason I expected it would not be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and held on to it, feeling totally drawn in. I read many of the other user comments and it impressed me how many people are talking about their fight in the ring, but the wonderful thing about Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All she has to do is find her place, where she is, who she is, and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story, and I am amazed that this is Michelle Rodriguez's first time - what a great job she has done. Adrian and her coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is rough on the edges, but it does not matter in the least. The story, the will and the performances outweigh any shortcomings (which are usually associated with indie films anyway). A convincing account of a girl telling herself about his circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
