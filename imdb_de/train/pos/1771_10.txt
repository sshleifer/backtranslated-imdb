A classic series that should be repeated at least or released on DVD. After Tyl adopted his parents after his parents' death, he embarks on a journey to find his true parents. After various pass rites, his quest culminates in the discovery that his father's identity was stolen and used by a trafficker in Europe! If I recall correctly, the series ends on the Austrian ski slopes and a cliffside chase that led to the death of Billy's father's traitor. The shootings were filmed in various locations across Europe and looked polished and incredibly good with some episodes of involved in film noir and thriller crime. The main arch was often covered by the stages of life that Billy experienced in his years of work Find his mother and father's secrets. A class, but underestimated and forgotten.
