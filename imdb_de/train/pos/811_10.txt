When I think of the return of the Jedi, I think epically. Yes, Ewoks were in there, right? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they resemble the Vietcong, which also defeated a technologically advanced army with primitive deeds). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an amazing ending to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy, and I think people can now understand and appreciate this after the Sith's revenge has come out. His salvation in the end moved and really brings you a happy, but bittersweet feeling. The best of course was the special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can outlast time with its graphics. The scenes in Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in this metal bikini) and of course the epic three-way fight in the end are still breathtaking. In all of the deep actions and emotional moments of the Jedi (especially between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals Leia the truth) and incredible special effects is the fitting ending to one of the most popular franchise stores in cinematic history.
