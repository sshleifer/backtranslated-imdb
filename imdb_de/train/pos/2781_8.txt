This was a delightful movie. A real feel-good movie, if you need one. The story is easy (this is not a Gone with the Wind), but sometimes you need that kind of action. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV series ER) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on them, they will be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for this movie was also impressive. A nice mix of modern and Indian sounds. I danced most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you need a fun movie.
