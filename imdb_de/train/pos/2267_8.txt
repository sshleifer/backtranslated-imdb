I have not read the novel or anything by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I want to start. This starts from the first picture and will not let you go until the credits begin to roll. In places you do not expect, the plot is interesting everywhere. The pace is pinpoint, nothing takes too long, and this is the perfect job to balance unexpected turns and allow the viewer to process what we've seen. It is well told and thought out. I've never seen a movie that I could compare that to. It's intense and exciting as well as funny and sad. The acting is excellent, Nolte shines absolutely, Goodman proves again that he does not have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are fascinating. I could go on, really ... No role is treated with a less than outstanding performance. The cut and the cinematography are wonderful and all the visuals are great, with some unforgettable and amazing pictures. I will choose the author of the books for more of Keith Gordon's films as well as the other two films that seem to refer to them. There is a scene of sexuality and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates it. it is not pleasant. 8.10
