This 70s show is the best TV show ever. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live, and the Simpsons in my book. This 70s show lasted 8 seasons, all focused on a group of teenagers / young adults who had relationships, separated from their parents, and their future as a whole. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers living side by side. They have lived side by side most of their lives, beginning to feel more emotions for each other at the beginning of their first season. Much of the show is about how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so he really shoves Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Although she drinks a lot, she treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, her neighbor, is obviously Donna's father. Bob giggles with different women throughout the show's history. Bob also annoys Red in full. <br /> <br /> The remaining figure, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the history of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, first season is great. At that moment, the characters begin to feel new things for each other. The first season is original, funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Second season is good, although not as good as the first one. It is a basic continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together, and everything works fine. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. It went back and captured the feeling and humor of the first season. I also think that the character chemistry has improved a lot and the show is so much more fun. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not nearly as good. Eric and Donna Arne't are here together, which makes the show a little less enjoyable. It's still funny, although I did not enjoy it as much as in previous seasons. <br /> <br /> Fifth season is the last season I thoroughly enjoyed. It's the senior year of the gang, it really helps with the story. The fifth season also had the best end of all seasons. <br /> <br /> Season 6 is good for the most part. It's extremely funny, though it does not capture the feeling of other seasons. The gang is not in high school, so I think she did not make the teenager feel like the previous seasons did. I did not like the last three or four episodes, considering that they had a dramatic feeling. <br /> <br /> The seventh season has the same feel as the fifth season, though it did not do it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season, since I did all the others, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The last season is totally crappy. Eric was not there, which ruined it. Kelso was also largely absent, which did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and was a fitting end to the series. <br /> <br /> So if you like comedy, then give that 70s show a try. They've stopped making new episodes, but it's still a bit on TV. I also recommend buying seasons 1-7. It's up to you if you want to buy the 8th season.
