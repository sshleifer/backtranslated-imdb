Lloyd Bridges like Mike Nelson and his boat were all stars of this series. What made it so good for me when I saw it was the feeling of going underwater. The show shows a youthful energy for underwater exploration that is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was instructive and showed the viewer things about diving from someone who seemed to be a consummate professional, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows and the program always seemed to be well produced. Granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than one episode, but each show has its own and every other show produced during that era, the childhood of American television.
