I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of time that feels like time travel. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong opponent for Byron, Claire is teen and a bit annoying, Polidori is a convincing, repressed sycophant ... all are beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the frightening wrecks that they are in Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as a standalone piece of shock film, and I loved it for a variety of reasons, but it works like a Merchant and Ivory movie, and from my readings it was the best recording of what The Summer needs to feel like , Romantic, yes, but every time I think of the movie, my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron is completely awakened. One of my absolute favorites.
