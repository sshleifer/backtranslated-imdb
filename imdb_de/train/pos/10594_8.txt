The pass to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. It is not only a fun and entertaining comedy, but also a cinematic review of bygone times, with settings and scenarios that are unfortunately just a reminder of British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton, who, after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb, discovers a wealth of medieval treasures belonging to the 14th-century Duke of Burgundy, buried deep beneath his suburban street for the last 600 years Treasure is an ancient legal enactment signed by King Edward IV of England (which was never formally revoked) to explain that this London road was declared Burgundian, which means that in the eyes of international law Pemberton and the other residents are no longer British subjects, but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street is a separate land and a law in itself. This uses war-torn and impoverished Resi Believing that they are outside of English law and jurisdiction, they incinerate their victims, destroy and ignore their clothing vouchers, disregard UK registration laws, etc., and declare themselves completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> But what happens then is Spiv, black marketer and dishonest crook follows and crosses the "border" in Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell his dodgy goods and half of London's consumers Follow them to avoid the ration, and make their quiet, happy little haven, a thieving pit and a rather overcrowded one.

However, they declare that the area is a legal frontier, and at the end of the road, they set up a fully-fledged Customs Office, mainly to monitor smuggling, to ensure the safety of the inhabitants of Pimlico. Ultimately the border is closed overall, resulting in a major siege. The Bugundian residents are starting to run out of water and food, but they are still fighting in true British style. In a Bugundian resident he quotes: "We are English and we have always been English, just because we are English we are so struggling to be Bugundians." <br /> <br /> A feeling that is soon repeating itself throughout the country as if the rest of London is being told by the poor Bugundians, they all feel compelled to intervene and help them by providing food and supplies throw over the barbed wire blocks. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who has fended off This is how invaders over the centuries have been brought to their knees by this new group of foreigners, especially as they are British !!!! <br /> <br /> Great story and a lot of fun. Not to miss.
