This movie is the best movie ever. I can not remember the last time a movie made me cry. With a tear in my eye I admire this movie. It has all the elements a good movie has to have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Drama, Story / Plot. A story about friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street that made the king of masks famous, and a little girl who sold herself as a boy on the Serbian bazaar. The little girl liked to be his granddaughter and the king of the masks a grandson. They were not really conventional. Every scene they were together was invaluable. The camera work is impeccable and packs you. The spectacle is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of the masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks pretty and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and kindhearted character very well. If you do not have this movie, try it once, look at it.
