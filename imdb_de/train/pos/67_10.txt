The industry dropped the ball. The trailer does not do the film justice and when it opened it was on a handful of screens. Had people had an opportunity to see this, oral work would have made it very successful. The two leading actresses offer great emotional performances that really get you involved in the story and especially the characters. I have reviewed this with the enthusiastic recommendation of Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie released on just a few screens. What was there no chance to be seen? Some movies go to the video quickly because they are not that good. This is Oscar-worthy and it is a tragedy on many levels that most will never hear themselves. Maybe it is inferred by word of mouth on DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie, you should. Great performances by the two main actresses make this film. It could just have been another formulaic teen movie after the school special, but instead it's good for other notable movies. Girl interrupted comes to mind. If you like it, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another, without being melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries most of the movie, she is so real that they are not stereotyped or melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you're an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better than in traffic. I hope these two actors get more roles that use their talents and make them shine. Watch this movie and recommend it to your friends if you do not want to be caught between all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried when Spiderman 2 set up the best records. In what word do we live? AGHhh. So, to make the world look right again and recommend it.
