This film has cheered me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and unwilling hosts were planted in a rural village. While I had escaped from the bombing raids and experiences that produced precious memories (for example, when I first sang a nightingale on a dark night) and had enjoyed a life I could never have had in London, I missed my family and worried me. Tom is an old man whose wife and child both died and lives alone in a small village. As an old man who is now without a wife, whose children are married in another province and live in another province, I am once again lonely. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas for raising a child. Since a deep affection has grown between the old Tom Oakley and this young lad, Tom goes in search of him and eventually rescues him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there are great tensions, as it seems due to bureaucratic decisions that the child loses someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
