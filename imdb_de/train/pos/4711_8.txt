Oh, what fun there is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a feel for the comedy's direction (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, look who's talking), but here it looks like she's telling the actors to go out and Have fun. Micheal Keaton blows through the role of Johnny, with ease his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame that directors did not understand. I even mentioned Richard Dimitri, who plays Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I do not think it's a coincidence that most of the name of the character is written MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are sprayed throughout the movie with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. Merilu Henner receives a good line. Even actors with supporting roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get into a good line. <br /> <br /> recommend it to a friend.
