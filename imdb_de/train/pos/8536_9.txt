I recently got the opportunity to see "The Waterdance" and I really liked it. I do not really understand why that's what it's called, because there's no dancing, except maybe in the strip club at the end. We get to know the main characters of the film, invalids in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically disabled man and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not watch movies of this kind today. I'm not "stuck in a time jump", I'm not saying that in the 80's and early 90's everything was better than today, but I really think the movie industry is getting worse and we can learn a lot from old films anything from 1920's 1998th
