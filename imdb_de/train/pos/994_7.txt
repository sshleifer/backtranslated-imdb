I've seen this movie once and may want to see it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good at the movie, I feel like they could have used a less funny character than Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes, for example in prison, when confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is again a wonderful performer of a policeman. His hard but mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. Once again, Morse Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) meets in the theater. Morse lands hard on Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this scenario in every movie. Personally, I love this quality in a movie in which the actors get into the same situation as in a previous movie, like these two in The Green Mile. Overall, it was a pretty good movie.
