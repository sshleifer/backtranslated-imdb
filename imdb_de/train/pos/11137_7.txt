Midnight Cowboy was very excited when it was released in 1969 and received an X rating. By today's standards it would be difficult to make an R-rating. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out-of-town hick who wants to grow up with the ladies in New York City. He meets a crazy hijacker called Ratso Rizzo, who tries to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a connection that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than in this presentation. He is so in character that everything else around him fades in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a skilful hand with his production, but this film has a grungy abdomen that leaves the viewer with a bad taste. Worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone.
