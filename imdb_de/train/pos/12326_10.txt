I first saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival, and I had never seen the Hong Kong Cinema before. I felt like in a rollercoaster: the action was so fast and there was no boring moment in the whole movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks for himself, sings and fights - one of the many scenes that emphasize the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is an absolute must !!
