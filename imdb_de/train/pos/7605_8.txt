Lost is an extremely well-done television series about some people lost on an island. There are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide who your favorite character is. In a minute he's something, so he's the coolest, then he's doing something right now, so he builds the coolest ones, then tension builds up and just as you're about to burst the episode ends and you like noooooooooooooooooooo! !!!!! So you have to wait a full week to see the next episode, but it's worth it to wait. Excitement, action, romance, humor, apart from the topless girls, but that's a good thing, because you can focus more on the story and in the story it is about. So if you like a good story and you like suspense, this is a good one, but I think it's probably better. (I also have a review that you could check it out.) I would lose 8 out of 10 points in particular Because it's so unpredictable, you never know what's going to happen next.
