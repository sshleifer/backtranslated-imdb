Paul Verhoeven's The Fourth Man is one of the most intriguing thrillers I've ever seen. It was really a pleasant surprise. The story refers to the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with the beautiful barber Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard, the story could be more. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and morbid sexual images. This really pulls you into the story that you do not want to see, but you can not turn away. This is by far the best film by Verhoeven (maybe only after Robocop second). True The Fourth Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are pretty unfounded (just ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes, you'll be thrilled.) This is one of the movies you need to know As it ends, a true whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, captivating, contentious and exciting, I even like the spider metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
