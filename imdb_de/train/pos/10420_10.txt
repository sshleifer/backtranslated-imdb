The Great Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting skills and is in top form as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, the soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. I dare say that he plays some songs better than Caruso (A'Vuchella by Tosti and La Danza by Rossini). The art and music departments of the MGM have also done a good job. This movie could be perfect if it were not for Ann Blyth's awkward presence; we see that she does her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unpardonable. Lanza deserves a better lead actress, and Blyth should stay with less demanding productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the movie's opera duets with Lanza and has the wrong idea that Caruso had a kind of permanent soprano.
