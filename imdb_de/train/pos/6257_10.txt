This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. The footage does not look all fuzzy and choppy, as you might think from the 1925 B & W silent movie. The nomadic tribes of the documentary leave their homeland in the desert and cross an angry river, men, women, children, animals ... Then it passes on a snowy mountain pass. It sinks or floats and climbs or dies. Looking for grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule that is too ill to climb the mountain. The children in the documentation all look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes in Iran are still living like this. Lets you appreciate modern life in the USA.
