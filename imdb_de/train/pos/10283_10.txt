House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a fine puzzle and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with wonderful performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and a strong, strong cast of supportive players, and it features Ricky Jay, an exceptional card player, prestige initiator and historian of magic. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is played as though in a manner, giving the film (in which reality is often called into question) an extra dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, House of Games offers a compelling insight into the unfamiliar world of cheats and cheaters that are completely different from The Sting, which was only played for glamor and yuks. At this level, it succeeds admirably. <br /> <br /> However, at a deeper level, examining a woman's odyssey can not elude you from complacent expertise to incredible power and self-fulfillment. The only film that I know of as worthy of the theme of personal strength in a woman is the underrated Private Benjamin. Unfortunately, this thoroughly enjoyable film dispels its focus, jumps between different themes and uses the good performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after a few simple laughs. House of Games sticks to its business. As Poe once said of a good short story, she drives relentlessly to her conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another series of films about women portrayed by Thelma and Louise, a big commercial money-maker with a despicable topic that women are doomed to fail, regardless of whether they own theirs recognize inner strengths or not. What a trip. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really see this movie in a movie theater. It should be self-evident for film festivals. Nominate it for a person in your area if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. Better she should see it on TV than not at all.
