Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate in terms of their TV work. Their film work, however, was much sharper (for example, The Bank Job of 2008 was fine, for example, Across The Universe last year, this was very weak). Still, Crazy is a solid success. It has a great story, great performances, a lot of humor, fabulous music and, above all, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy "moments", and this movie has one of them - just when everything gets pear-shaped at the festival reunification performance ... <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
