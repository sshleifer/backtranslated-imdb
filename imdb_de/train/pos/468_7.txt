The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought back to the screen and many in the cultural world are made aware of it. The director connects us to the story of Alexander, an absent chaplinesque study of chess dependence. Nastasya is on vacation in a marble column village where a chess championship is held. She meets Alexander as he picks up a queen piece, which he drops through his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction develops, suggesting next day that the mother alerts the husband. He arrives and asks Alexander to bring these transitions into the past, ala 'Godfather II., Where we see the young Alexander, a prodigy. He is taught by a teacher and uses his genius for 10 years to earn huge sums of money. The thought that Alexander has reached his peak leaves him, but becomes a legend. The old teacher returns and tries to bring victory to an old rival Alexander. In a serious game of chess, where the world chess champion's victory is a possibility of immortality, the chess clock is ticking, ending the season and ending the next day. That day is Nastasia's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent into a nervous breakdown. Nastasya holds her stomach and looks through the mantle of her lover, finds his strategy for the game and follows the movements. Although the film unfortunately deviates from its Russian roots, the garments with low back are lovely. Alexander plays his role sublimely. The director underestimated her audience. We barely play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is to act for queens the opponent king with your 3 paws and king, sacrifice the castle for helpers. Nastasya is a great game, but he feels his conclusion deserves more intensity, but maybe the emotions were just right, because chess meant more to him than she did. The Luzhin Defense elegantly honors Navokov, the complexity of his work in pictures is a world event you should not miss.
