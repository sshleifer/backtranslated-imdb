This was another message from the Second World War to the soldiers and the Allies to draw attention to rumors. These were referred to as "instructive" cartoons because it was a mix of serious messages and a weird looking character named "Pvt Snafu". <br /> <br /> We all have fantasies, fears and have you, and this happens as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes in with "five". You can cause panic and disasters of all kinds if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe it. This also includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as shown here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. This is still done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," explains a big nonsense towards the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans have not learned it yet. This cartoon may be 65 years old, but has relevance today. As I write this, there have been two terrorist bombings in Europe today, and some people still think that "War On Terror" is just a slogan for bumper stickers. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous Dr. Suess, uses analogies to "hot air balloon juice" to present the above message here. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> Nothing funny here, but it should not be. One has to understand the climate of 1943 and the legitimate paranoia that existed during the Second World War. People forget that the war with the victory of the other side could easily have ended. It was a tense time
