All right, here's the deal: If you're slightly offended, you might want to stay far from it. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably got as red as I laughed. Actually, I probably got MORE red when I laughed. And when I did not literally turn red outside, I blushed inside. If there's absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you, then you just have no shame. Whether this is a badge of honor or not, is probably in the eye of the beholder. I will not deny that I've laughed a lot, but this is a movie that I just can not recommend on a flat basis because of its subject matter. If I said, "This movie is hilarious, give it a try!" and a sweet little lady going to church goes to the theater and has a heart attack in one of the graphically explicit sex situations, that's just something I do not need for my conscience. <br /> <br /> How slippery is that? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mother would have gone during the first scene. I feel obliged to at least warn you what to expect. <br /> <br /> There is a clever, intelligent comedy here, but I expect that from the man (Judd Apatow), who was both freaks and geeks and undeclared. I'm just making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to fight Kenny Rogers for his money. Paul Rudd announces, "If I hear that Ya Mo is back there, I'm going to burn Ya Mo," is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we saw a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed a good two minutes after the joke was over, while most all chuckled and then forgot , <br /> Strangely enough, despite the attack, there is an admirable moral in the story. The movie does not show Carrell as a crazy loser just because he's a virgin. He is really portrayed as a sympathetic, admirable character. Sure, he is a bit weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, "more video games than an Asian kid," and a toy collection with the Boss of the Million Dollar Man, but we never think there's anything wrong with that virgin. Strange as it may seem, there is a small "It's OK to wait" message. <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, be warned that this pushes his R rating as far as it is possible. That was certainly the intention of Apatow. In his opinion, he just let some of the guys (especially Rogen and Malco) improvise and talk the way they normally speak, trying to find many new ways to get dirty. If you can handle it or speak this way yourself, you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive obscenity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, smart humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of sexual discussions with F words or friends. But that's me. As I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments, but you have to wonder if it's worth sitting in one of the most vulgar movies you'll probably see in the theater. I just do not know how interested most women are in what men discuss when playing poker. Honestly ladies, you may not want to know. If you have always been curious why some girls think guys are rude, then you get a good idea. <br /> <br /> Go - my modest, honest opinion, what to expect. Be that your guide. It should by no means be seen with your Sunday school class, mom, grandmother, opposite sex family members, children of any age or anyone who is easily offended by exaggerated profanity or explicit sex talk. If you saw this with one of the above points, you seem to have no idea what to feel uncomfortable about.
