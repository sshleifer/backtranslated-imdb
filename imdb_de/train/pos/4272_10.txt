That's what I call a great movie. It lives on the fantastic actor skills and a simple, but human story. There are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. But the main theme is very cruel, like live. The bus driver and his son collect people across the country (Yugoslavia) on the way to the capital Belgrade. The funny and cruel situations that happen on the way connect the people and the pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> look at it and you will remember it for life ... it is full of Slavic humor and way of life. <br /> <br /> and another reason for his magic: it's hard to get !!
