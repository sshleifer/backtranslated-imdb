The wonderfully urban Ronald Coleman presents himself here like in a few other films. He is literally in every scene and this weird film stays fresh because of him, not despite him. He is pretty, funny and very smart, as he is always one step ahead of his wandering, loveable wife - played perfectly by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French piece and brings the best qualities of this farce. Most of the cast are known, at least by name, if not by name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, as he is always one step ahead of the other characters. His all-round talents are even more worthy of recognition in the classic "Lost Horizon", which every film lover must see.
