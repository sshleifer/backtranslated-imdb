I got that in 1996 in a one-week cinema visit. I was very impressed and my feelings have not changed much. <br /> <br /> Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., who describes his life and his films. There are interviews with people who have worked with him or known him. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or bizarre recoveries. It's interesting (something), but was it really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's movies and they're just awful. Wood had ambitions, but no talent for doing it. I would not say he was the worst director of all time, but he's down there. Do we really need a documentary about a very mediocre filmmaker? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a kind of saint. Quite a few of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated the man quite a bit and it is clear. They also ignore his films in the erotic film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still, it's interesting if you're a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (the wood tears) and Dolores Fuller (a longtime girlfriend).
