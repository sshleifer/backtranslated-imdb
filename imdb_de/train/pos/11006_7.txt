This Filmfour-funded sci-fi movie is definitely a must. The Manchurian Candidate has a great influence and offers nothing new or original. It is handled with the utmost skill that it appears fresh and resourceful, even though it is basically a re-run of an earlier movie. It's good to know that films like these are still being filmed (even if they do not get big releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The action turns and turns, giving it an element of paranoia, and also serves to keep the audience at the edge of its seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The action follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburbanite who decides to take on a job at Digicorp, listening to speeches from various competitors and picking them up for reasons unknown to him. However, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young woman named Rita. <br /> <br /> This film has a series of white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with its apocalyptic imaging of the future. This gives the movie a very strange look that sets it apart from most other movies of the same type, with Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange being just a close partner. The plot is also very efficient and the characters' development in favor of the more stylish - and more exciting - plot increases. You never know exactly where you are with the plot, which makes it even more intriguing. The drama is largely good with a largely unknown cast, which supports the team of stars. Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam looks very much like the part of the calm and discouraged man in the middle of the story and does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actress with a CV that is not quite up to her talent, but she has a look that fits in with this film. Cypher is anything but perfectly illogical in some sequences, and sometimes it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an imaginative new science fiction movie; Cypher is the way to go.
