Sentimental and naive, but undeniable, emotional man-helping request, in this case personified as German and French miners, who had to be separated by a new frontier after the First World War, which led to a disillusionment on the German side. like the French are the bosses. However, when a fire breaks out on the French side, the normal decency of German men leads to help, security and even friendship. This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, as a certain man of Pabst's own side would break this piece and merely make the Great War a prelude. But for me, it's obvious that Pabst really wants to believe or hope for this fundamental humanism, as this film radiates with this optimism, while his slightly funky, cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera does not have the necessary bite for this work. His honest belief is that the characters are not simple mouthpieces for positions, but real people with real families whose homes we know. These are ordinary workers from the working class who happen to believe in the value of caring for and treating their fellow human beings, and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I will laugh a little at my plan to get a positive message that is a positive message Point of view that we can all strive for. <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently the end has been cut short on most prints, with the French rebuilding the Mining Gate and the men shut off again a brutal turn of events, and maybe the movie has made a better movie overall but I would complain if he acidifies the positive vibes of the last sequence, so I'm glad he was cut off.) {grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931}
