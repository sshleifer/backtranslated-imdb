This movie is not a typical horror movie. It has some funny humor and death scenes that can seem funny. I personally liked the movie because of its unusual humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the performance of Hillbilly Guy and Lester ... very believable. I think I will dye my hair red like this girl in the scarecrow - very cool! Nevertheless it is worthwhile to rent for the campy humor and the not typical horror experience.
