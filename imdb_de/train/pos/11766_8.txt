This movie contains everything you expect from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, baddies and worse. It's fun to see James Belushi use his humor to get out of the trouble he's been in since stealing $ 12 million from the ultimate big boss, The Skipper. Sounds cheesy. Of course it is. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It's a lot better than all the direct DVD garbage that's made these days. If you can overcome the stupid plot, you will find that this film has some surprises in store. You might argue that the twists are predictable, but the fast pace of this movie does not make you think too much about what a blessing is because this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. Just the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. They were probably expecting a movie about gangsters instead of some crooks crossing each other.
