Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film in which Freddy Krueger was listed as a solo act (not as an entity or co-star). The killing years have called for the city of Springwood. The time has come for the little town to become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have paid the ultimate price. Only the madmen inhabit the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that does not stop Freddy from seeking his last revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he learns something more about his old life. Can the kids finally stop Freddy? What is this secret buried in Freddy's twisted mind? To find out, you have to see Freddy's Dead. The end was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverse life and he has to go out! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger play the main role in this last episode. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the last, but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If you enjoy the show then you do not want to miss it. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
