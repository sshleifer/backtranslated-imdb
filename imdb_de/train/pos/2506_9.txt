Moon Child was one of the more symbolic films I saw. What I really liked was the illustration about immorality / mortality and the obstacles and guidance through life. The film shows a lot of Vampire Kei with the power of immorality and the benefits of it. Whether it is supernatural abilities or an eternal life, people usually wish that. Moon Child shows the pains and disadvantages of immortality, as the feelings of loss affect almost all characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Moon Child" reveals itself as the movie comes to an end, where it is clear that everyone is a moon, who makes the other people's path shine and gives orientation. Personally, I like the moral on which the film is depicted. The weaknesses of the film are in some parts of the drama and special effects, as the film became less authentic. The scene in which the character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions were included in the drama. Some scenes with special effects, such as the gunshots, could have been more authentic without this being similar to an action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns seemed too fake, and I think that could have been eliminated or remedied. Still, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should look at. The symbolic ideas and images produced by the film are easily accepted by everyone and can interest many viewers. It's a pretty pensive movie and entertaining too.
