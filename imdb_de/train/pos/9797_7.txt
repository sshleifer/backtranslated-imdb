Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman direct to the video / DVD movie being released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crimefighter, the Batwoman, who for some reason is personally involved in stopping a major arms shipment. <br /> <br /> Although interesting enough, the movie is not as good as Mask of the Ghost, Sub-Zero, or Return of the Joker. The main reason is that it does not trigger the emotional appeal of the other films. Nobody at the end of this movie is so sorry for us as in the others, especially "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy that made the other animated films special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batwirts alter ego seems so incredibly "stiff" and boring that it does not really matter to the viewer what happened to her, what made her put on the mask, or what happened to her in the end This is the main reason We do not get that special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie. It has its moments, for example, when the audience finds out who Batwoman really is and sees an old villain coming back who was last seen in the original "Batman: The Animated Series". The action also makes very exciting moments. <br /> <br /> If the background of the Batwoman would be more interesting, this movie in my book would have been better than 'Return of the Joker', but as it is now, it's # 4 (out of 4). <br /> <br /> As far as the animation is concerned, it's the same as the cartoon of The New Batman Adventures from the mid to late 1990's. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but still it's good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD as it is pleasing despite its shortcomings. But remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated films. <br /> <br /> 7/10
