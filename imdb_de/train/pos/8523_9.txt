I had been a fan of the book since the third grade, so of course I had watched the movie, read the sequel and then watched the TV program. It was a good show in itself, and now, as an adult, I still enjoy the show. My only real problem was that it did not follow the book. When I saw it for the first time, I was so disappointed that I switched it off. But that comes from a girl who has a first supplement to the book. But after a while, I decided to try again, ignoring the book (as you did with the Harry Potter movies). I thought the series was wonderful! It was a clean cut and something everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy to keep everyone running. It is really fun! Clean and wonderful!
