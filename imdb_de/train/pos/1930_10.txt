This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I've become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie and watched him at film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I have seen it now about half a dozen times and each time the enthusiastic response of the audience has confirmed that this is one of the best movies to come out in years. At almost every festival it has shown, it has either sold out or been awarded the Audience Award. It's clear that people love this movie and it's even clearer why they do it. The cinematography is superb, the characterization and the acting brilliant, the ending fantastic and the direction full of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It is hard to believe that this is the first film by Ishai Setton. I hope it will be published soon so that everyone can see it.
