James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play colleagues in a Budapest gift shop who do not really like each other and do not know that they are really nice pen pals who have yet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, very appealing played by two sympathetic stars and a very eager companion. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (not sure how to explain it) that movies just do not have these days. This is of course comparable to the current You've Got Mail, and the original wins in every way. <br /> <br /> This is a compulsory display of every Christmas. I can not imagine a better way to start a Christmas feel like this little gem.
