How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime, two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians who died in kitchen fire while useless people live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised children fighting against the repressive high school administration. It's extremely stupid stuff, but there is an optimism that is refreshing (even if they blow up the building). Who knew that would be a problem for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule from a time when people still believed that music was important and that it could have an impact on the wider society. It is full of children who know that authority does not have the right answers. Rock and Roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most important, this is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Just go in and have a nice time. If this was not the way school life was in the 1970s, then it should have been.
