Much has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real "Miike" movie, and I thought that this kind of description might have been a cliché. But like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humor, the homosexuality, the taboo test and the difficult to sympathetic central character. However, Shinjuku is one of Miike's best-formed films. In an interview he says that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I mean, what he means is that the film has a really fascinating energy and a raw edge that seems so fresh that, while it can capture a visually or technically more complex film, it can not reproduce the purity of that film. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is absolutely visceral, bubbling blood and grubby blows are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has struck a chair over her face. (Only a Miike movie could let you get away with such a sentence.) The film has a fantastic tempo, unlike Dead or Alive, which starts and ends strongly and drops off in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar topics. Miike is obviously concerned about relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period. This emotional theme is treated well here. The central character really comes alive when you begin to understand your past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing Shinjuku's praise enough. I do not want to give too much away. This is Miike, before he used CGI to animate his films, almost reminiscent of Kitanos Sonatine. The central characters are well executed and the final twist guarantees that you can reopen the movie after the movie ends to clear everything up.
