This movie starts off vividly, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally moves well, has some very good moments and ends at the end of Act 3. I saw this twice in LA premieres (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leading man of tomorrow. He is humorous and self-respecting, but he is better as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles is "ok" in a new comedy role, but she does not "steal" this film as it should be a star of her caliber. For an actress who has so much potential (10 Things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see her continue to play such average roles, and not that she takes on the role and flees the role Movie (like Daniel Day-Lewis in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does an 'ok' job. I did not expect her to pay for the academy, and she has none, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is "above average". Maybe the problem is more than anything else in the script. I liked this movie! But it's not a movie in which you go away and say ... "that was great!" ... This "story" has been done so many times and there has not been much new here. The dinner dinner scene was probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller offers an incredible performance in a supporting role (he might be the best surprise of the film). If you want to see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if it has not changed the end ... again ... go during the church scene , or you will certainly be disappointed.
