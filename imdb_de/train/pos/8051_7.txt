"One of Hung's better early efforts, the humor is sometimes overkill when Hung tries to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also a bit where Hung makes fun of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master, and the action is pretty good as well At the end, a trio of martial arts experts is not the best movie, but pretty good for the 70s kung-fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee, but be warned: most of the videos are Versions of the film are of modest quality and there is also a character in Blackface that some people might find offensive Sammo Hung is a rural swineherd who moves to Hong Kong to fend off some bad guys Sammo exposes his dead Bruce Lee impersonator This film is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon", but it's not exactly that ... Sammo is a shepherd of the countryside Pigs - owned by Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant With the new job, he has to defend the place from local gangsters seeking protection money. When Sammo goes into combat mode, he turns on his Bruce Lee identity, which must be seen to be believed! This movie is pretty sloppy. In many combat scenes, Sammo fights people who are more likely to be actors than martial artists, and there is a character who is supposed to be black and played by an Asian man in heavy (and absurd) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy, it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
