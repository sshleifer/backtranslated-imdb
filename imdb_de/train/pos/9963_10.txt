I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I enjoyed it every time. Sure, the graphics are a bit cheesy compared to now, but it was great in the 70s. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That's how I remember my Christmas with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, get them to watch this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". , It's a different version than today, but who says there is a way? <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie. It teaches children well against bad. I do not know what the English subtitle version is or if there is an English version of it, but Spanish is the best. Have fun and happy holidays! Feliz Navidad!
