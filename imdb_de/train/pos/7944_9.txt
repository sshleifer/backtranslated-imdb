Have you ever or do you have a pet that was through you thick and thin without you being lost and loved, no matter what? Betcha never thought they would feel the same way as you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft spot for animals, you are guaranteed to cry at any age. When I was a kid, I watched that movie all the time, and I think I love it the same way I did when I was sixteen. I could never choose a favorite character, and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but hostile family. I love Chance and how he ends up saying he finally has a family. Cheesy, yes, but you have to keep in mind that this is a family movie that perfectly fulfills this role. Sassy just has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect model for the young, adventurous chance. <br /> <br /> The animals tower above the humans, but the tearful moments are most to have during an interaction with them (ie to save Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack, which gives every moment even more emotions, and an accompanying heart swelling feeling. I give this 9/10. Comparable to (and even better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe.
