I actually found this movie "interesting"; finally worth a look to see and rent. True, some scenes were overkill in terms of emotionality, screaming, etc., but what movie does not emphasize the agenda, the genre, or the "ax for grinding"? Almost nobody! What surprised me is that I read a review that a S.Fran reviewer did on another review site, but instead found a negative description of his "own" review of the film. Not at all from the movie. Anyone watching this movie will find it's great to recommend it to family and friends. no chases, yes !! Being myself in an Italian family, I can fully relate to the environment displayed on the screen. The film also has cracked parts. In such an environment can be real life. Good movie.
