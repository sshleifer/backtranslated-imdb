I can not believe I'm watching this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about slave abuse, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - as I've never seen before I do not want to be "entertained" by the pain of others, no matter how authentic or informative it should be. <br /> <br /> So I think the main thing that I noticed in The Color Purple was that it was not about blacks being abused by whites. The blacks were absolutely capable of rape their own daughters - or give them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but in the end everyone broke away and the spectacle was phenomenal! I could not believe Oprah was playing at the age of 35! And I love to start Whoopi - she was amazing. I am so glad that I felt bad yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running The Color Purple.
