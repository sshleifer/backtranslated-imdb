If you read only a summary of the plot, this film sounds like a very typical movie of the 1930s. The story seems pretty elaborate, the topic is maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film lies in the direct, earthy performances of the cast. I have seldom seen Jean Harlow hovering such a range of emotions and subtle nuances over her face. When you observe their faces in the chapel during the wedding ceremony, the depth of the feelings between the main characters is obvious. The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: When Clark Gable looks at his son with such joy and surprise, picks him up and proudly says, "My child!", I can not remember that Mr. Gables own son was born he posthumously This is one of the best examples of the cinema of depression.
