Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan bring their flock from Seattle to Alaska and on to Canada to apply. Once there, they have to deal with the seductive, unsteady businesswoman Ruth Roman and the ice-cold, happy crazy villain James McIntire. John Wayne may be talking about more, but his good friend made Stewart some excellent, hard-edged westerns, some with the great director Anthony Mann. To be honest, I take it with his rugged action sequences and fine melodrama about North To Alaska every day! <br /> <br /> The Far Country offers stunning scenery and cinematography, which should definitely be recorded in widescreen format. <br /> <br /> There is also strong support from the always reliable Brennan, Roman (who is great), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types does not take himself too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would be a great double count with another highly recommended man / stewart in the north west, Bend Of The River.
