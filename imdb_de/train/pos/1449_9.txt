This is one of the best thrillers of the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast and a strong storyline, and many of the players involved did a great job. Pacino was great. he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good as long as the viewer does not disturb his Louuu-siana accent. It can prove annoying if you do not like this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and sometimes funny. Danny Aiello was great as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good, but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second consideration to remember "which Zapatti was which?" After so many cross-references you have to stop and just think. The end did not have much sting. It was built up so long and was a bit disappointing then. This was one of the few problems with the movie. Since the film was not billed as a "big blockbuster" high-screen hit, he let some forget that this movie existed at all. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splashes" in theaters is not likely to have resulted in any nominations. It has been unsuccessful in the home market, and viewers are still finding out that this title is on the market. Made in 1996, it still stands today and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So, make lemon pudding (you'll see) and watch this movie!
