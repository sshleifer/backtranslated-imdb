Go back to page 10 of this overview section and work your way back. Go straight ahead; I'm waiting. <br /> <br /> Ready? Well, then you probably have the same trend as I noticed. You could pick the lame jokes, dated timing and obviously derived plot points and the sound of 'Bogus' all day long, but this movie seems to be one of those who hate me now, I love them later. Bill's biggest problem and Ted was that the original appealed to the kids of the 80s, who followed the trends and saw themselves at the cutting edge of fashion. I would get caught if he had worn something other than flannel or confessed that he was anything in the 80's Like Ted would say, "Man, this is a totally deep hole. Want to play 20 questions?" <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is said to go in 20-year cycles, and that certainly seems to work here to be the case. Here, in 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth start to pay tribute to some of those crucial films that made us who we are or not, if you're one of those 'Bogus' look at it as if it were an obsolete ("fa gs!") rip-off, then you miss the point and probably spend six years wearing facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed. <br /> <br /> Self-referencing His Own Origin (The Star Trek Episode ") B & T makes no attempt to conceal the love of its creators for tribute Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I'm not saying 'Bogus'' True Love 'is, but I think it has to be valued what it is: a fun snapshot of our society at a time before child psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking advertising, terrorist paranoia, and the proliferation of media anxiety. <Br / > <br /> So for all the B & T haters out there ... turn off your CD with the screaming trees, take the hair out of your face, go to the beach and make it easier, narcissistic depression and intellectual boredom is SO corporate.
