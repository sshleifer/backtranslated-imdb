This may be the most nostalgic journey back in time and back to the time when childhood begins a journey of going backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, up and down, and back and forth. Puffinstuff, Dr. Linky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion and even the evil Witchie Poo through and through. The latest inspiration from Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview Special", Sigmund & the Sea Monsters and Land of the Lost are both new and old, and this show was the perfect way to fill that gap, as did Donny & Marie Show. The Brady Bunch Variety Hour or Brady Bunch Hour and even the Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Maybe other things in between and Beyond the Buck just keep moving, even beyond expectations and unexpected boundaries. Now that we're updated in March '06, we know that Jack Wild has left and now it's even more symbolic for us to become really nostalgic. Now in August 2006, both when playing Jack Wild as a guest on Sigmund and The Sea Monsters, as well as on the latter episode, HRPuffinstuff recalls all the nostalgic travels of all Syd & Marty Kroft characters, including The HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, The Donny and Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, or Brady Bunch Hour, etc. Honestly, Stephen "Steve" G.
