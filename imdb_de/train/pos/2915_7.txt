Bunny Comes Home "The Man's Navy" deserves more recognition than it gets, a clever script by Borden Chase directed by "Wild Bill" Terror, which came into play a few years later. The 1944 produced Japanese defeated the battle scenes a small Déjà-vu. Tom Drake's melancholic appeal for the bright young Jan Clayton is solid chemistry, playing real and confirming Drake's career with Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel'. Wally Beery, a bit deceptive, prides himself on an ever-disbelieving Jimmy Gleason? His memories are an enhancement of reality, giving Beery a Ulysses-like shadow against which he can play. The images of the Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) are authentic and were photographed by Tustin and Lakehurst. The P-38 squadron is not in March. Lot 3 doubled for India and Bunny's U-Turn ?? Bunny is coming home ?? is Beery giving back an authentic piece of his past, something he wanted to believe was true? then is the future we are in again fantastic? Now on a larger scale, a redesigned Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance aircraft? how expensive, blissfully optimistic? still: "You have to believe it, so you make things come true ??"
