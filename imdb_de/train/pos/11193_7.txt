I kind of liked The Lonely Lady somehow. Give Pia a break. She looks good and has beautiful eyes. What's not to like The scene in which she is raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was pretty crude and cruel. In fact, a lot of the stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel. But it's a shabby movie. Many dirty films are not all bad. I liked that better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not only trashy but also boring. At least that was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia gets undressed a lot and acts as a writer miscast. It's incredible how she talks to a man about Pushkin and Byron three times her age. I'm sure Pia is a nice person in real life. She just does not project the writer. She looked much happier as she worked for the type of Saturday Night Fever hostess and wore a glittery disco gown. <br /> <br /> A few scenes are funny. The one in which she tells the actor with two bars that she is pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and grabs her to "stop staying!" > Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to run a supernova (the swirl of floating faces and freeze-scream - whoa!), And her subsequent catatonic stupor is somehow exaggerated, but still. I want to see someone who holds this speech in an acting class. <br /> <br /> But this is also garbage we talk about. In the eighties you could find worse in every movie of the week.
