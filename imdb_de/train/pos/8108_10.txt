I have "Things to Come" on D.V.D. and it is very clear compared to my VHS version. The sound is fair, but sometimes it can be hard to understand. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. There have been details of why some things happened. The best thing about the movie are the little things that I did not notice at first. John Cabal played with a toy airplane at a Christmass party as if it were a diving bomber dating his naval power, calling a battleship "Dinosuar". Ships sunk by Luftwaffe, an unexplained enemy attacked by planes. Flying planes flew. Strong roles for the women throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is more, watch the movie to enjoy it.
