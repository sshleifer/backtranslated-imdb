Bela Lugosi plays one of his rare good roles in a series based on the lengthy radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing character and is no longer sad Get roles where he could be the commander in a good way. Here, Chandu returns from the East to help Princess Nadji, who is chased by the leaders of the Ubasti cult who need them to bring the high priestess of her cult back from the dead. This is a good looking globe series that is a lot of fun. To be sure that the tempo is a bit relaxed, listened more to one of the principals (the producing studios), then a blustering adventure, but it's still fun. This is better than the two feature films cut from it, because things can happen at their own pace, rather than feeling hectic or feeling "Hey, I missed something". One of the trilogies of three good series that Lugosi had made, the others were SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
