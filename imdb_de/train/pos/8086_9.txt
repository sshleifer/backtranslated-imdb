I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings after seeing the live action version of FANTASTIC 2001's movie. The live action trilogy "The Lord of the Rings", directed by Peter Jackson, will undoubtedly be far better than the "Prequel" trilogy by George Lucas (Episodes 1-3), which has ever been regarded as the true fantasy film series of the 21st. Century is considered! > <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a kid, and I did not quite understand the depth of the movie at the time. Now that I have read the books, I understand what the story is about. To be sure, some of the characters are pretty stupid (Samwise Gangee is especially annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One (AWFUL!)), But I have to say, it pretty much follows the book. and it goes in part two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the action is a bit interesting and some animations are quite remarkable for their time. The bad part is that it ends half way through The Two Towers, without Frodo wanting to destroy the one ring and the animation looks outdated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Not all that bad, as many say. BUT the live action version of 2001 is the new trademark of "The Lord of the Rings"! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn made him create one of the biggest fantasy series ever made. So at least we can thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings with me every day through the live version of Harry Potter! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1-10, which is far less violent than the 2001 live action version, but NOTHING as good as possible! For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
