Although I can not claim to be a comic book fanatic, I've read my post, so I'm probably part of the audience of this movie and was not disappointed. In the end he runs out of air, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, has stayed on the tailoring floor. A little bit of Blue Raja from Hank Azaria can go a long way. Still, forgiving all these mistakes is easy if you have a movie that is so much fun. All actors seem to enjoy their roles, especially William H. Macy as Shoveler with a straight arrow and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys. somehow it seemed appropriate.
