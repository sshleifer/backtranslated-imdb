This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, much of it is familiar: winter, canoeing, dropping, hunting and the like. It's easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching this movie a few times, it's grown on me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is known to many filmmakers director Attenborough and scriptwriter Nicholson for extending the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan can represent a complex man well, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is charming in her first major role. The rest of the cast is solid.
