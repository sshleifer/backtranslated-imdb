I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it then, and after catching it on a Canadian station in August 2005, it's still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find the soundtrack or the DVD in stores ... ... everyone wants to save some light or I have to order it from an overpriced internet company. But back to the movie, the music holds the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain's' 80s. Actually, it was the same decade that I moved to Canada for the same reasons as "Thatcher" did what she did to the country back then. If you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not apologize!
