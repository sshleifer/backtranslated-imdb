One of my favorite movies that I saw in Seattle in the preview. Tom Hulce was amazing, without words he could convey his feelings / thoughts. I actually sent Mike Ferrell donations so that the film can be distributed. It is good. The system says I need more lines, but I do not want to reveal any plot stuff. I was with Hulce and director, a writer I think, and Mike Ferrell in the audience in Seattle. They talked for about an hour. Not really a dry eye in the house. I do not know why Hollywood stays stupid. (Actually, I know it's our fault, look what we see) Well, you get what you pay for. Get that and see it with someone special. It is a gem.
