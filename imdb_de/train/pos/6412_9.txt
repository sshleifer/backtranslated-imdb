I am sure glad that a film about Carl Brashear's amazing life story was filmed. As in the era of civil rights, Brashear became an inspiration to people of all minority groups who were unwilling to settle for an expected status. Brashear, as played by Cuba Gooding Jr., sets a good example of the lifestyle he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who has integrated baseball and lets him stick to his character and behavior. As Brashear, Gooding knows he does not want the life his father Carl Lumbly does not have, and Lumbly really makes it clear that he's getting more out of life than he got. But while Harry Truman has integrated the Armed services after World War II, the Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a cook or an officer who denies the real fighting parts to him. This is not good enough for Gooding, who applies as a marine deep sea diver. <br /> <br /> Once in the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets responsible for everything, mostly from the Master Chief Petty Officer, thrown at him, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro still has some prejudices, but he is still a hero and one who can inspire when you pass the discipline of race. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but when they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good services include Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school Guy the Navy just wishes to withdraw for reasons you see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people who have the courage to free themselves and change.
