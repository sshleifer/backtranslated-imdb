Ghost Story (the TV movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The movie was well written and well played, and when the TV series began in 1972-73, I thought if the TV series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie would be available on video !!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with William Castle as a leader. Manufacturer. However, if you have the opportunity to watch the original TV movie "Ghost Story," check it out. You will not be disappointed.
