I do not have much to add to my summary, this movie ranks Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made without trying. I do not think that should be taken seriously when looking at it, as it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I do not think it detracts from Christopher Walken's reputation, as his reputation was weaker anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him up from the sleep he had been in. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the great jokes while not trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I find amazing is the budget this movie had. The scenes and actors and explosions, etc. are pretty amazing, so obviously someone liked it very much and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or she was, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads this and is looking for information about McBain (and I doubt there are too many), you just know that this is a hilarious movie with a smile on your face should be!
