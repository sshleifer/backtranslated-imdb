ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the heyday of the mid-70s to be very aware of it, even though I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-80s, when I was about fifteen, and laughed all the way through. (Is not it the dream of every high school to ruin your school and blow it up, all set to a rocking soundtrack?) I recorded the movie one or two years later, watching the Ramones concert sequences thinking over and over again : "Man, those guys are kicking their ass! I have to watch some of their albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, countless Ramones LPs / tapes / CDs and three Ramones shows later, they are still one of my favorite bands, and RNRHS drives me insane every time I see them. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.P.I. all), at least we have this movie and lots of great music to remember.
