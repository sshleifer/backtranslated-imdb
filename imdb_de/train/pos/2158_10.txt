I do not like "inflation", but I just had to give it a 10. I can not think of anything I did not like. I saw it last night and woke up today and thought about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake that someone told me about J Lo and Richard Gear will be, but this 1996 Japanese version was so emotional and thought-provoking that I barely think about it It could be improved in any way, or the environment was transformed into another culture. <br /> <br /> A story I wanted to see, and with fistfight scenes or weapons being fired, or something similar! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All characters seemed to be well developed ... even non-primary characters had good character development and a pleasant acting, and the casting seemed very fitting. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good movie musical in our time, and maybe that's not quite enough (there's a lot of learning how to dance, but no singing), but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who have championed a place of dance in our lives have found this film and the role of dance to be very valuable in helping to tell a story about a middle-aged man succeeding in a Japanese family was looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the Japanese team that contributed to this film. Thank you for creating it.
