This show is absolutely worth seeing. It has the best talents I have seen in a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I think the executives of ABC are also not used because it was not a reality show). However, this show was credible with sympathetic characters and wonderful storylines. I'm probably not in the age group that they will like the show since I'm in my forties, but many of my friends loved it (late 30's - mid 40's) and die for quality shows with talented actors. I do not think that this show was given enough time to win an audience. I think that this show would have worked very well with more time. Once again, ABC does not give a show of real potential a real chance. With so many shows, the chance after another is given and it's far from worth it! You have to give quality broadcasts a real chance and have the time to really click and win an audience. I really loved the characters and looked forward to every episode. I watched the episodes of ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us one more consequence (number 13?). We want to see what we can do! Bomb ABC with emails and letters and find out if it's possible to save this show from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving, and this show is definitely one of them. Sign the online petition at ABC at: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
