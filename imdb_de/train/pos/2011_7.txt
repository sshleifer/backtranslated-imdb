If you have never seen this movie and like old-time actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely skinny, with sunken cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave an excellent performance with many dance and music numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role, along with Victor Borge, who played the classical piano and no baton comedy like in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great pleasure at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
