I have never heard of this movie, he saw it on DVD. Big movie, perfect example of a movie where every actor makes it work. Not an overly typical Hollywood movie with the same old, over-hyped actors. No Current Quote "A" List Actor I have not deducted any performance in this movie. I remember my own military experiences after the Vietnam War. It focused on the people who were sent to fight. As was depicted by the characters who had fears and emotions even when some volunteered to serve. They were also ordinary people, some just were not meant for military life, I remember some of my experience - to put it mildly, it could not adapt to military life - but I'll never forget it - should have stayed in touch.I highly recommend it and then think of those who serve today in Afganistan. The basic training is a journey. Note that these sergeants are not morning people and maybe a "sensibility training" HA! HA! HA!
