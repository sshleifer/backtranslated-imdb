A film for a contemporary audience. The masses see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. This is not exactly a movie you would like to watch with the whole family. It is not for children's eyes. I had to rewind quite a few scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're just looking for entertainment then this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. I have to add an elaborate production. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the film is not universal. It emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you will become good. And if you do evil, you will become angry. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life this is not always true. It is well known that most people in this world do not get justice. While it is true that some evil people come to a bad end, there are many who flee. And then there are many people who do good, and for that they come to a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in the message and everything you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer in order.
