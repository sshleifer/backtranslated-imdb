A true classic. Nicely filmed and acted. Shows an area of ​​Paris that is alive and full of comedies and tragedies. Although the area of ​​the Hotel du Nord and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and as happy as it needs to be. The film longs for the past that has been lost, with a sigh and a bittersweet.
