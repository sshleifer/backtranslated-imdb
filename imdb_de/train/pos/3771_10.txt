In 1991, the two best sequels of all time were released: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. I have always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the better, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, a more comedic duo than Bill and Ted is hard to imagine. You are unique. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by National Lampoon's O.C. and Stiggs, Bill, and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo when they appeared at a Los Angeles local theater in the 1980s. The two quickly began writing a screenplay for two, and BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was soon born. The film, filmed in 1987 and published in 1989, became a major box office hit and an instant cult classic. It was not long before work on the sequel began. Stephen Herek, the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE', was not interested in continuing the sequel, as he considered this to be too mean and unlike the first, so Peter Hewitt, who made his feature film debut, was staged as a director of the film episode. There could not have been a better director for this job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is wonderfully directed. It is filled with a unique style and an energy that can not be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequels of all time is the fact that it is darker than the original so funny. It does not change the characters like most sequels. Bill and Ted are the same loveable characters as in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original authors. Most sequels are not written by the same authors as the first, but since "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same script authors, they ended up as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE," if not better. "BOGUS JOURNEY" is, just like the first one, absolutely funny, well written, funny and above all original. It is filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable "journey". 10/10
