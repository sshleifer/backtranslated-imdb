Actually, I'm surprised that there were so many comments on this film. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American university. But no one in the US has heard of it, which is a pity! The dynamic between people makes it funny and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus trip - most of us were already there !! But I have never had such a !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when they stop for the funeral. Then the man and the woman sneak off to a lovemaking in the forest, but everyone follows them to watch without their noticing it! Just as she pulls her skirt up and he goes all the way inside her, consumption begins to hack and they realize everyone is watching !! Talk about surprised! But ... you really have to feel for her, even if it's weird! When you see the end, it's ironic that they were having fun! Serbian humor at its best!
