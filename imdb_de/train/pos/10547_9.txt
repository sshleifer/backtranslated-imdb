I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. It made a lot of the fact that the movie was "directed by Cube" and made it look like a horror movie, even though it's actually an absurd comedy (IMDB's spell checker does not seem to believe that Absurdist is a word, but it is ), reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way the story builds up slowly and then gradually escalates. I am also glad that there is no explanation of what happens in the film. That and the fact that the story is mainly in a set are the only aspects in which this movie is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
