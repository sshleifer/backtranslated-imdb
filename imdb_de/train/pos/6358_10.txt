I love this movie, but I can not figure out what's wrong with this movie. People who dislike this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe Mr. Carrey is behind all the make-up. And I'm sure most of the movie's actors and actresses made films before. And in the movie there is a new face. Taylor Momsen playing Cindy Lou Who. When that opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And make some Whos Whois in Whoville. We know that those who love Christmas. While The Grinch does not like Christmas. And even make fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), the daughter of the city's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrator's voice is by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as mayor of Whoville. Who does not like talking about the Grinch near Christmas time?
