The story of Mrs. Patty Duke about her life and the struggles with manic depression were like my life struggles. I saw myself as behaving as she did. I was so surprised by the similarities in our lives to include the sexual abuse we both had as children. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it premiered in 1990 and I loved it so much. Anyone struggling with manic depression can get so much out of this movie. No matter if it showed their awards or what they were for. That's not the problem here. The question is how Ms. Duke had a disease and struggled to survive and overcome it. Ms. Duke can be very proud of her achievements in her struggles to survive a disease many victims are often hopeless. <br /> <br /> If a person has not personally struggled with this disease, they do not know the hell they have to live. The film was a success for me because it showed the real problems and acts like a person who is depressed and manic. It was so real ... so, really. It was like watching myself up there on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could personally thank Mrs. Patty Duke for having the courage to inform the public about her illness. bocka
