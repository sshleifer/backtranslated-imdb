What can I say? Mrs. Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde, and like an Italian American, fan number one of female beauty, I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember a lot the plot, the situations or the other actors. All I can remember is that Erika is just gorgeous and that she looks better in this movie than ever. I really do not care if it was a bad or a good movie. I'm only interested in the beautiful moments when I was a teenager in Brooklyn. I just think of Erika's beauty. <br /> <br /> Well, just to say if you're a beauty fan of Erika Eleniak like me, this movie is definitely for you.
