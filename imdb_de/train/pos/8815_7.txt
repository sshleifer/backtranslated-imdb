This collection of eleven short stories in a movie is a great idea and includes some great sections, but also some disappointing surprises. Due to the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to approach the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not just an individual sympathy for the American people, but mainly intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. Ken Loach (UK) presents the best segment, for example on September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with US support. <br /> <br /> The other outstanding parts are those of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by US governments in different countries in contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), who shows a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family whose son was falsely accused of terrorism in the US when he was actually a hero. Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows the innocent Afghan refugee children how to prepare harmless bombing while their teacher tries to explain to them what has happened on the other side of the world. the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows the effects of her war in a small town and the lonesome protest of the widows; Sean Penn is very poetic and shows that life goes on. and Shohei Imamura's story is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war, but sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> The segment of Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naïve, but shows the terrible bad conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The segment of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative and shows more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing. terrible, without any inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("11th September")
