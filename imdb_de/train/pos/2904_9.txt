This film is Damian Szifr√≥n's second immersion in movies after his outstanding character study in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well made figures, far from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I've seen Szifron's talent for carefree portrayal of each character, but just enough to emotionally connect with them. His control of her is great, so he returns the film a great direction and a brilliantly polished script overall. The characters laugh and cry with real feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their development on the screen. <Br /> <br /> The Spaniards take over the English, the urban landscape of Buenos Aires replaces Hollywood sets at night and the premise is just as interesting as any other. So we have a movie that dares to fight over Hollywood's machines. <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie because I've never dealt with such lovable characters before. It seems the script fits perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really think, to meet with a movie like this, Argentina really depends on the competition.
