Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie you will never forget. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the "king" in the drug world as he ruthlessly directs his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are uncomfortable to watch. This movie has about 180+ F words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. They cheer for the drug Lord, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as evil as other Crime Lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you to see this. You will not be disappointed. 9.10
