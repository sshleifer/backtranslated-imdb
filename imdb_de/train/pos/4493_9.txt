This is an excellent film about a traditional working-class family in the north of England. Filmed on location in Bolton, James Mason plays the father, who is the dominant force in his house. Or so it seems. Skillfully, the film, based on the play, describes the complexity of family life. The side cast is great too, with many familiar faces supporting it.
