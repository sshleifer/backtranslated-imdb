I've always enjoyed watching Chuck Norris in the movie. Although acting may not be great, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills by his side. In my opinion, the Norris Brothers have proved to be good entertainers and this was another good production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
