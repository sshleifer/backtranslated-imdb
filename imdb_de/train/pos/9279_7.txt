Jafar Panahi's comedy drama "Offside" portrays some women trying to enter a Tehran sports arena, where women are banned. The official reason: a lot of impure speech, and the football players show their legs. But of course it's really about sexism. Therefore, most of the film is a bit of comic relief, with women asking serious questions about why women are banished from the stadium, and a woman even has her own program to challenge the men. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, all films by Jafar Panahi (including this one) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the fall of the CIA in 1953 by the Prime Minister and the subsequent support of the brutal Shah Ayatollah Khomeini gave an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinist society and Iran's current policy to George W. Bush Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an excuse to play the cowboy and tighten censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a nice look at the people who find ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but worth seeing. Considering that all films by Jafar Panahi are banned, I wonder how he can do them at all.
