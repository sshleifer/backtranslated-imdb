The Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives on the state border. He decides to ride his lawnmower because he can not drive and he wants to do the crack alone. The film beautifully shows his journey and the lives he touches on the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth, as well as the rest of the cast, presents himself in a beautiful performance, especially Sissy Spacek in a ravishing performance as his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old Geezer trip across the countryside would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the insights into men's lives, made this a movie I can recommend to anyone.
