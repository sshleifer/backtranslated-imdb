The funniest parody of sophisticated Art House films ever made. This movie shows all clich√©s and more! Agonizing bad (downs syndrome!) Actor. Terribly difficult, self-important dialogue. Scenes that should shock but drop off flat. Jarring machining. Pointless plot points. All in a kind of iridescent miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague mental dizziness. <br /> <br /> It achieves exactly what it was created for. A funny satire out of those boring movies made of tainted teenagers' trust to show to their parents when they ask them what they've done in the last two years! After "What is this?" Presenter Werner Herzog received the Cannes Prize, they said that the film was a parody, partly in his own films! In the info he allegedly blew up. To this day, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> However, see and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years.
