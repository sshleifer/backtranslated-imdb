Distortion is a movie that somehow surprised me. A kind of multi-layered drama in which a man writes about his life experiences that happen to him right now. More specifically, he feels his wife is cheating on him, and he takes a private look to sniff him. His wife has no idea this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play also have some asses fooling around with each other and with, as I said, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. The whole thing culminates in a theater with all present actors and the predictable (but not really). <br /> <br /> The director of the play ensures that the cast and the arrangements of the ensemble really go on. A Way of Watching You This is actually a funny movie that I like to see and recommend to people would take a look.
