The film begins very slowly with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, a staff member of a photo service. His wife was confined to her home due to an arson judgment with an ankle bracelet. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes firefighters seriously. <br /> <br /> As we watch Wallace's rather boring life, something new and shocking comes to the city. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. Also Wallace. They are both pyrokinetics or "pyrotics", people who are able to trigger fire through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. Spoilers: Some of their differences are due to a childhood incident in which they accidentally caused the death of a tramp. Wallace holds back to use his powers. Wilder wants to go public on national television. <br/> <br/> To complicate matters, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, both of whom she had years ago. It becomes a point of contention and one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal firefight. <br /> <br /> The movie is entertaining but not funny. I think enough of it to have a copy in my library. It's a good offbeat movie.
