I just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD. The spectacle is consistently excellent - no question. There was not enough action for me, I have to say. No real tension as such, just a lot of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "Whodunnit". If you like a good story that is told slowly and carefully, then this is right for you. Peter Egan as the lead actor Magnus Pym is awarded. The film portrayed the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of British intelligence, but was psychologically damaged by his unfortunate childhood so that deception in all things became his way of life. As a child he adored his father, but his father was repeatedly exposed as a crook and cheater. Pym did not cheat on ideology or money, but on deceiving those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is mortally damaged by his father's influence - he has eaten away his moral strength. He has no real love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6-hour series. Very well done.
