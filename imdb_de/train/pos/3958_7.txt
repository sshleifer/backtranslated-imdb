Moe and Larry are newly married husbands who married Shemp's demanding sisters. In his music studio, Shemp learns he'll inherit a fortune by marrying someone himself! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a remake of the 1947 "Brideless Groom", considered by many to be one of the best Stooge movies with Shemp. The remake contains most of the material from this movie. The new scenes, recorded on May 17, 1955, include the story of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, as well as cooking a turkey infused with turpentine! A couple of new scenes are also pinned at the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green was used, and if you blink, you will miss twice that.) <br /> <br /> "Husband's Caution" would have made for a good movie with you just the plot line to marry the sisters. Budget considerations, along with fewer bookings for two-roll comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage. Although completely new films were shot by the Stooges, most of their releases from 1955 to 1956 consisted of older films with some new scenes. "Husbands Beware" while one of these hybrids is watching and entertaining; We see most of "Brideless Groom" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to take the viewer through the film. This film is one of Stooge's latest comedies, featuring new Shemp recordings, and was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
