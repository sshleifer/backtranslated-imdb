I saw this movie today with my kids (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film, the children of the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) shared several stories about his life and the making of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the tangents, my two kids really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to rewrite many subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything, but the bottom line is this movie is so much better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially kids movies) out there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" King of Masks that can / could do 12 masks at the same time. The actor in the film trained and learned to make up to 4 masks simultaneously (then they would cut and switch to 4 new masks).
