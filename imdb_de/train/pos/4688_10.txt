I showed this about 17 years ago in my 6th grade and the students were thrilled. I loved it too. The history of termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. The cast of the creatures is deep and everyone plays their part well. The fight between the two cold-blooded Titans is really classic material. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did incredible camerawork and this should have been the Best Documentary Oscar. The copy I have is not told by Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and is not referred to as "mysterious castles of clay," but only "castles of clay." That makes me think that Welles must have been added for star power and an Oscar push. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently, and it's now my kids' favorite movie. They brought it to the latest family reunion instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're actually lucky.
