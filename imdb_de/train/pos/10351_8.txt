When the Chamberlain family camps near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being pulled out of the tent by a dingo and begins a ordeal nobody needs to experience. It seems that the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing becomes a circus. Nor does Lindy help because she does not play in front of the jury or in court, she's just herself, and she's a tough nut to crack. Of course, everyone believes that they are guilty because there is a piece of evidence that has not come to light. Sam Neill is honored as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people in other places are just as biased and stupid as in the States, because the Australian public does not believe the story and the media just fire the flames. Finally, Lindy is found guilty and put in jail for hard work, but years later a missing piece of evidence appears and she is released, but only after the family's life is basically ruined. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a bit long, but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
