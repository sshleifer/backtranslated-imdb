This early black-and-white Sirk melodrama is a small film, but it does show the flair of the German director of making tired storylines something like art. Barbara Stanwyck, who plays in the 1910s, is the woman who sinned when she gave up her husband and family in the small town for the temptation of the Chicago stage. She has never fulfilled her ambitions and is retreating to the city she left behind, through an eager letter from her daughter, informing her that she too likes the theater (a high school production). Back in her old town, she comes across Kleinmut again and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, the confused (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The storyline is nothing new, but Sirk excels in creating meaningful compositions, with each image meticulously recorded, and he is immensely helped to have Stanwyck as his lead actress. It takes a whopping 76 minutes and that's a good thing, because the material does not really have the legs to go on.
