I saw this show as a kid, and I loved it! I saw it when Toonami YEARS came ... Sheesh, I sound so old! I had to be 13 or 14 when it started ... But it still had a great storyline, and I'm one of the girlie girls who saw Sailormoon (and ADORED), and I really liked it. The animation was not the best ... Actually in some parts amusing, and the voice was initially extremely lame, but it was all a good clock, and I felt busy day after day. <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and an eternal favorite. Go Ryo !!!!
