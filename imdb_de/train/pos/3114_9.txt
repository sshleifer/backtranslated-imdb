I'll keep that pretty short so as not to spoil anything for you. This movie is great. From start to finish it is filled with real thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chases are intriguing, and they are moving at such a pace that it felt slow towards the end of the explanation, but that's just because everything went first. Damon shines and has really proven to be a very solid actor who makes you believe in this role. He is that role. A welcome addition to the series at David Straithrain (hopefully I've spelled it out as well) as a rotted CIA agent to kill Bourne. This is uninterrupted and lets you really lie on the edge of your seat most of your way. Some things towards the end are just a bit absurd, negating a rating of 10. The end is open to sequels, and I sincerely hope that they consider doing more, because none was bad. All in all a great movie and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaky camera did not do anything to the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is, you really only notice it when people are talking and not so much the plot.
