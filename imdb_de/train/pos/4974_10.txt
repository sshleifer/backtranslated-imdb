This was a pleasing presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority, and innocent astonishment. The quote (or scene) that I remember vividly is when Hemo gets sick of "all the plumbing ... you have not learned my secrets at all" and threatens to storm. Saltwater that makes the Fiction Writer dreadful, but calms Hemo and fits so neatly into the chemical aspects of the blood. <br /> <br /> This wonderful mix of entertainment and information makes this classic as fresh and engaging as the day it was released. Arousing interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching children learning.
