I do not doubt Victor McLaglen won his Oscar for Best Actor for this film when he had a triple split among the Mutiny on the heads of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a good movie, because John Ford would not have got his first Oscar for Best Director. There was no split in his prize. <br /> <br /> The film and story of Liam O'Flaherty, on which he is based, refers to a poor fool of a man named Gypo Nolan, formerly a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was fetched back for a foolish stunt he pulled and wants to be recovered. He is there except for his last money and if he can not get back in, he wants enough to get to America. There is a reward of Â£ 20 for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness, he goes to the Black Tan police and learns about McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is very excited about who McPhillip rattles and they are pretty sure it was McLaglen. He does not have the wit to really hide his own tracks. He struggles weakly to name another man named Peter Mulligan, who is played by Donald Meek. He also attacks a hanger played by J. M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The whole action of The Informer takes place in Dublin in 1922, about six in the evening until early in the morning. It is inevitably turned into darkness and shadow, making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had he done it after World War II, the informer would have received a great noir classic, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which he looks very much like. John Ford knew this world very well. He took a break during the rebellion, was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before he became anglicised was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give the movie fans a certain interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informant because Black and Tans will grab him and get some more out of him and endanger the entire organization. <br /> <br /> The IRA process scene is the highlight of the movie. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of her court, Meek can not say no. The justice and judgment of the king do not run here. It shows graphically at this point that despite the occupation by army troops and military, the British actually lose control of the population. <br /> <br /> Of course the informer has a rather grim story, but rather less John Ford than you would expect. Even if McLaglen spends his money on a drunken Spree, the IRA is constantly in the shadows, watching him and counting everything, what he wants. The Informer is a story told in a dark and gloomy time about Ireland.
