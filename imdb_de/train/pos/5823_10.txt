In Micro Phonies, the henchmen are the best. In this summary, the three craftsmen who work in a recording studio. At the end, they see Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the spring voice. The voice is incredible. Curly in drags hears Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three Stooges are going to a party where Curly will dress in tow clothes. They play a record of Spring's voices and everything goes well until Moe destroys the plate on Curly's head. In the end, they use the Lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and pulls the power plug. Alice Van Doren attacks the boy's cry and hides behind a curtain to help them. Everything is fine until the baritone wonders how Curly discovers Alice behind the curtain without the help of a phonograph. The three stooges turn out to be a scam, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. The henchmen are thrown out of the room. Excellent.
