Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual who made his living as a waiter in the "Grand Slam" by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire of celebrity building. The waiter and the hatchee girl of the Russian restaurant, played by Loretta Young, become America's darlings as bridge partners, who do not quarrel. With the help of publicist and ghostwriter 'Speed' McCann (the wonderfully dead Frank McHugh), they walk to the "Stanislavsky System," a "system" of bidding, whatever it feels like, br /> <br /> Commandments are not rational, there is no basis for charges because of their stupidity). <br /> <br /> A duel with the displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds near Goren, no? and I suppose the choice of the name of the character "Stanislavsky" was also a slam on another system), a bloated charlatan well-played by Ferdinand Gottschalk is broadcast by radio stations across America like a prize-bout by Roscoe Karns (Another great, fast-talking, deadpanic comic actor of the 1930s.) The bridge players are even on a run-down Square, although the audience, unlike them, is above them in boxing "rings." <br /> <br /> The wide variety of American types shows the comedies of Preston Sturges, though for the production of celebrities "Grand Slam" Most views recall two better films from the same (pre-code) era, in which Lee Tracy plays fast entertaining <br /> <br /> publicists: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam". has its <br /> <br /> moments, especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious points. <br /> <br />. Loretta Young was already a clothes horse. (For me, her face looks a bit long and horsegy.) Another era of beauty, I think ...) Unfortunately, the movie <br /> <br /> lets Glenda freak out Farrell, who misses McHugh's forgetful <br /> <br /> Girlfriend plays.
