I really liked this movie. I rented this and expected something not bad for an evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were funny and they managed to be in a movie not just a stupid slapstick comedy, but with some sense and moral values. I succeed in both ways. I have never seen any of these actors, but they were sympathetic and made me pay attention to what happens to them in the end, which says a lot. The script is smart and engaging and looks refreshing. I think you will not be disappointed to see this.
