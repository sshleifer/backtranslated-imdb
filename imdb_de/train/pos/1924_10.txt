This show was great, not just for kids, I thought at first, but for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mostly about the father who took care of him, two daughters and the son, unfortunately he died in the second season, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed, they've continued the show like what's really going to happen in life and I have to mention the Goodbye episode It was so well done that it must be so hard for them To film this, one could say that there were real tears in her eyes. I'm 24 years old and this episode made me cry because I know how they felt when my dad died when I was 13, just like Roy. Season 2 and Season 3 had a great comedy There was also Season 3 with some of my favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think the show was strong enough to keep going. I was disappointed that it ended. It was one of the best, no was the best family comedy show since Home Improvement and could have been the closest friends. <br /> <br /> It should never have ended, but still loves the repetitions every day.
