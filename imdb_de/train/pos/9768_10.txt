This is the best piece of film ever created. It's a masterpiece that brought a tear in my eyes. I will never forget how I experienced it. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur plays a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. This should be released on DVD in Superbit format so that I can fully enjoy it as if it were to be enjoyed when produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg is really a tough, hardened policeman who has partnered with a hot dinosaur against her will. Then comes Hi-Jinx, to say the least. By the way, I say that the complete opposite of what's true in this movie is utter garbage.
