The name Hayao Miyazaki became known as Spitied Away, but what is often overlooked is the director's first efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg Duel or George Lucas judged THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late '80s. What fascinated me was the visual opulence of the design and the animation. When I found a specimen for Â£ 9 in a well-known store, I could not resist but buy it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie does not match my memory (memory is funny this way). <br /> <br /> If you look at this film now with all the knowledge acquired from the artist portfolios, it is much like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud is one of the works of art. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a clue to Jonathan Swift's overlooked part of Gulliver's Travels. With sound references to Jules Verne, it is a fundamental film against bad chases. The last part where the heroes land on Laputa is the part that is strongest in my memory - the "pastoral". The ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss under the huge tree. In my opinion, this is the highlight of the film - the view of the surface of Laputa as opposed to the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Even though this is the dichotomy of this film, even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot to look after the garden and animals. The end of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievably stylish, I would not say "slick" - very nice and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and design and look of just about everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and appreciate it.
