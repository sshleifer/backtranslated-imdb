The second part of the Why We Fight series focuses on Hitler's attack on Sudetanland and beyond as he hobbles Neville Chamberlain and begins his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> This propaganda series, which was clearly intended as propaganda over time, has become an informative documentary, with most "Allied prejudices" turning out to be historical facts. The leader rises on his own petard with smug statements to his people and the world as he says one thing and does another while his army moves eastward. The Czechs and Austrians capitulate quickly, but the Poles lead a heroic fight against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The inequality between Hitler's military power and Chamberlain, who waves the Munich Treaty like a white flag and declares "peace in our time" to this day, has lasting propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more as the darkness of World War II enters Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options: freedom or slavery. In 1943, there was no circumvention of this simple truth, and The Nazis Strike effectively expresses its point of view.
