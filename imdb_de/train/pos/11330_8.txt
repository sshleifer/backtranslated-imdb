This is a nice story of guilt. Matiss, on a solitary night walk in Riga (?), Comes past a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He walks by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film documents his efforts to find out more about the woman. He finds her paperback in a troll of local bars. He disintegrates more and more from their common life. His "appearance" changes with increasing obsession. He has to do things right. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with the "bastard ex-boyfriend," he forces Alexei to face the guilt that both feel. <br /> <br /> Spooky takes a long, a sinister soundtrack that emphasizes the guilt of dogs barking. Steps Beautiful Film Noir with a nice twist. A good indie ending.
