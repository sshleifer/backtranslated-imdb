A surprising rental in a local video shop. I was delighted to find a media satire worthy of challenging Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my television when I was in late 2004, as the Republican machine performs its magic on the majority of American television. The question is, "Are we really that manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It has definitely distorted my view. It also provoked a greater theological question - the story of Christ. Could word of mouth and the overwhelming dependence on something exploitative as television create a messiah? Could the story of Christ be exaggerated? Could it have been completely made? It's something that puts the film in an extremely perceptible light.
