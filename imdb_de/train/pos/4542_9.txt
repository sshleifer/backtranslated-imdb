Located downtown and out of Detroit, I found this comedy to be a fantastic new comedic duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very jolly man who happens to be a police officer from Japan on the trail of a thief of industrial crime who stole a "proto-type" super charger after he was ordered by his commander. Pat's character clashes with "Jay Lenos," a quick talk, but up to a Detroit-type policeman. But when they cross, the venerable "Ways" of Japan meet the investigative "Ways" of the Detroit police. The two stumble and stumble over each other first, but then develop a "rhythm," which turns into an explosive two-layer power plant team that solves the case, cold. After battling the stolen "equipment" with a city criminal and completing the case, they both expect to despise each other, to be friends, and to work well together. A little worse for the wear and when they need a longer vacation, they come to a victorious conclusion. I rated this with a 9. Lewis' directing makes this an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
