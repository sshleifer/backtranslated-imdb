This is a very good Spanish film, but I am worried that many will feel lost out there because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was about or when it was fought. As a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily see that the movie might be confusing until you put all the pieces together. I doubt that this would be a big problem in Spain, where this movie was made, but for other viewers, they may be a bit confused until they later appear in the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returned to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and they learn that they are coming to Spain from New York City. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and most of the film is about how she adjusts. Why she and her mother are alone, I will spill it now for those who do not know that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this bloody conflict) <br /> <br /> The Film receives extraordinary grades for its beautiful camera work and music. The slow and sprawling pace is not bad, assuming you're someone who can accept movies this way. I've seen some other Spanish films about this war, and that's pretty much comparable to them - no better or worse - just a decent life movie about those who were left behind, as well as a nice, aging movie /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side is which, the Republicans were mainly socialists and were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the US). The nationalists were led by Franco and were supported by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
