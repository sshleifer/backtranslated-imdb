It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last two years (I watched the premiere in Tel-Aviv, Israel, in the summer of 2006, just when the last war started ...) This problem in communication between The people who cause wars have been interested in me for a long time, and it does not matter who - boys and girls, heterosexual gays, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the bubble three times, and it's still surprising and exciting - Each character reminds me of one of the many people I know and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw it, I was with my friend, a Christian Arab and it was on Israel's Independence Day (the most symbolic I could - how ironic) and ... he cried in the end !!! - If it was touched and it was not embarrassing, everyone would be touched by The Bubble!
