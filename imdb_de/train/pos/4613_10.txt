This movie has one of the kindest acts I've ever seen. That makes it so great for me! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. Although there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully "comedic" together. I wish Yvonne De Carlo had had more action when Lily. She showed that she was able to make a comedy in the original series, which was mostly wasted in this film. The movie also features the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think that a better work could have come of it.
