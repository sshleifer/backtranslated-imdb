One of the joys of recording the new Bela Lugosi collection is to watch wonderful movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi work together in a film that deals with meteorites and radiation, and while the science is completely absurd (especially the camera technique that Karloff uses as Janos Rukh to determine the location of a particular meteorite) and downright ridiculous I did not care, because the movie is thoroughly fun. The effects are well done over time, the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and 50s, complete with blasting guns and ridiculous science. You have to see this movie!
