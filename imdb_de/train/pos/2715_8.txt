Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and it was really one of the few that was worth planning! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices, it would be much better than 1982. I'm curious that it's available on DVD! with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I'm all a big fan of QED, had a much more intellectual quality. But that does not suffer - the dialogue was funny and the action was high. The show was a mastermind in the UK and it had some BBC feel, but with better production values ​​than BBC normally had at that time. This series was initially running and had a lot to do in my life to take time out to watch TV , However, I remember my dear mother who called me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on, and we sat on the phone and looked together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. is a sad loss, and if it could be done today with the same quality and the same values, I would be very happy if it brings a return.
