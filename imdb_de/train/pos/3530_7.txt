I can safely admit (as an IMDb freak) that "Phantom Lady" will never get into my Noir Top 20 movie. It can not even sneak into the top fifty. But instead of discrediting the film because it is not as good as many other classics of the Film Noir genre, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady" contains enough strong and lasting images to make the movie worth seeing. The viewer only needs the ability to get beyond the awfully slow beginning. The film is cooked only when "Kansas" (Ella Raines) tries to prove everything but one hand the innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night. As a freshman, she does well when she works on the streets of New York at night. Gradually, she begins to assemble parts of a murder mystery. To be honest, the movie belongs to Raines and only because of her presence does the movie work well. Somehow, she can breathe life into a movie about a convicted man who is not at all interested. I'm not sure if this fragmented dynamic of a characterless captain is the fault of the actor or the director, but here's something terribly wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines As a novice detective, things accelerate into a different hidden pace as 'Kansas' visits a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) to search for information to help her convicted boss. She and the drummer paint the city in a new red during their visit to the "all-night" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene will either prove unfair to the scene or, worse, ruin the scene altogether. You will know the scene as soon as the last pelvic crash is over. If you are fortunate to have this movie on DVD, you will most likely rewind that scene over and over again. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this movie remarkable. It's mainly because of this scene that I rated 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of a 6. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this movie looks lame and bland, with some great scenes and a great scene. It's the "Drum / Sex Scene" that separates this movie from everyone else in the same industry. <br /> <br /> And just as the film says: "With Vanilla you never go wrong," I would also like to add that "going with vanilla" is the safe bet if you do not go for one more tasty enjoyment can decide. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
