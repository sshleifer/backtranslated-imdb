Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your ruthless Maverick cop who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and over), he never stops following the bad guys , <Br /> <br /> When a state-of-the-art US tank called "Thunderblast" is driven across the border into Mexico, it is attacked by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva) , hired by Russian villains. The army members involved are detained as prisoners, most notably Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who happens to be McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey does not have the physical presence of someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate track for a movie of this kind, but he's having a great time as a confident guy who can deal with the Wisecracks quickly , Wing is a great female lead; Not only does she look incredibly sexy, she's also a great action babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and the ever-welcome William Smith (as Russian major) are a disgusting scum in the classic action-movie tradition. The minor cast is full of well-known and reliable character actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. T. L. Lankford and B. J. Goldman deliver the script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. It's a kind of script where you just know that writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their stuff is absurd and cheesy, and they're just having fun throwing credibility out the window. Experienced action director Steve Carver provides movement and delivers a respectable amount of shots, explosions and general chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is great fun for the action fan who does not mind turning her brain off and on and enjoys a generous assortment of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
