Let's get down to business: This is the movie I would take on a lonely island (with DVD player). It's just perfect. If you want to watch a movie because you love the actors, you want them to be free in the space and the emotions involved, then this movie is for you. See the scene where Myrtle (Rowlands) gets drunk on stage and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because she does not follow the script anymore. If you are sensitive to the camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the particular current through which the Impression Camera follows the actors, as if they were inspired by the theater principle of "private space". And the story is just a brilliant mix of history and realistic drama, Cassavetes argues again with Hollywood and the politics of the majors, but this time he does it on Broadway and makes one of the most exciting films about theater. Well, this movie is a stroke of luck.
