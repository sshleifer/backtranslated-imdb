I did not even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin's review and 1 1/2 stars. Nevertheless, I saw it on the advice of my son and found it much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars from a 4 star system. You need to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I finished high school the year the movie was made. Maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there is a certain pretension in the film and it is, to a certain extent, strange, but that was the 70s, so what do you expect? I can see why people may not like the movie. However, I can not understand that people say it's boring. The movie is anything but boring. They will either hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you're probably brain dead.
