A preprogrammed stunner with Stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore sleeping upstairs. These pre-code flicks really let go of everything without leaving your imagination behind. Stanwyck excels as Lilly, the daughter of a Speakeasy owner / father who has sold his patrons more than alcohol. After the old man dies (good!), Barb goes to the big city for better things, they sleep upstairs. John Wayne makes a bad "cameo" and proves that the actors get better with age and an acting coach. I loved the banter and the strong lines between the actors. I recommend this movie to all movie fans and Stanwyck, who is gorgeous and beautiful as Lilly is.
