I liked the Night Listener very much. It's one of the better movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. Everyone played exactly the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the mother and never exaggerates. Everyone is very credible. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut out of the movie. The director has narrated a story and done it in an uncomplicated manner, which is a refreshing change from many directors of those days who seem to have their say. The task is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and be good at it tell. <br /> <br /> Do not get beat up by the previews and ads. It's not a Hitchcock thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie was the end. The director could have left something more to the imagination of the audience, but this is a small mistake.
