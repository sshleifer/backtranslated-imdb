as a habit, I always like to read the "hated" reviews of a particular movie. especially one that I want to comment on. and it is not so much a point counterpoint. I just like to see what people on the other side say. <br /> <br /> But I want to address one thing. Many people who hated it called it "nice but shallow," some even say that the desire of the norm, the inability to help his brother, was at best a secular conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I do not want to agree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction, I can tell. They see every day how they abuse themselves. They only know that their current path will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and it's not about what exactly when was done; why or why Paul decided to take up gambling and connect with questionable people; it really is more like they are wired. On the one hand, they are true geniuses and, on the other hand, painfully self-defeating (it's very similar to Howard Hughes's, you know that, and worse, you realize you can not do anything about it.) Norman Maclean is running a river through the river The tragedy had to take place and who was to blame, there is no one at the end and there is often no reason for it, but it takes great personal fears to really get that realization, sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it does not come at all.
