**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I know it's hard to ruin a historical documentary, but I'll reveal some background and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is not an extraordinary documentary only because of the remarkable footage, but also because of the story behind it. Since the Naudets did not want to tell the story of 9/11, but that of a novice firefighter, the emotions of the men and the viewer's connection with them are more real and powerful than in a normal retrospective. <br /> <br /> "9/11" is a textbook in filmmaking. If the events are an actual script, they would be great if the characters are set and then thrown a curve they need to respond to. This is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw material shoots the directors had to go through to put this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film gives an insight into life in a fire station. Specifically, how a beginner assimilates into a team of veterans. But this part is pretty good, and if the documentary had its intended course, it would probably have been solid. The brothers seem realistic about the process of becoming a firefighter in NYC. <br /> <br /> Of course, hell breaks loose. The chaos after the WTC attacks becomes obvious as various characters we've met get into frightening situations. Not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions are a very moving picture of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> The aftermath of firefighters being lost and found is a human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many films, the viewer not only knows who will live and die, but really cares about it. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say is that the Robert DeNiro (who I like) gossips were not informative, unnecessary, and did not push the story at all. They were probably added to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The best documentation I've ever seen. Nonpareil depictions of raw human emotions and dramas. 9.5 out of 10.
