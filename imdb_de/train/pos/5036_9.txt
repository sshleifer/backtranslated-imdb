Bill Paxton of Aliens, Near Dark, and the notoriety of Terminator surprises me with his debut as a director for Frailty. He hits all cylinders, but in the end there is an implausibility involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth), who deducts one point from this otherwise deterrent and thought-provoking thriller. Besides, this movie was okay. Bill Paxton plays dad. He never gave a first name, but that's not a weakness of the movie. It actually strengthens the movie and allows the viewer to see it as a kind of symbol of some kind. He has one day a vision of which he says he was sent by God to tell him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) punish the demons and kill them. The demons look like normal people killing them, and the onlooker wonders if dad has just lost his mind or if he is really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points, adding to the confusion and adding more suspense to the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is narrated by one of the adult sons (Matthew McConaughey) in retrospect and talks to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and justifiably so. After all, it is not commonplace for someone to come to your office to let you know that he knows who the killer is. The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton rules magnificently, advising us without losing interest. The spectacle is incredible. The two young leads and Paxton work great together and act like a normal family, even though they are all involved in murder. As I said, there is the one implausibility that affects Powers Booth's character, but it's really not a big deal. This was an extremely well made movie that included faith and family.
