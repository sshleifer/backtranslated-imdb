"World's Finest" is a unique project. It's a trailer for a Superman / Batman crossover movie that does not exist and will never exist, at least not in that form, with these characters, actors and plotlines. <br /> <br /> So the movie is a great eye-catcher, even more than the standard for real trailers. The trailer hype you in vain. In this regard, I really did not like this short project. Looking at this trailer makes you hungry and more and more sad at the same time - and you may even feel cheated afterwards when it turns out that a full-length movie of this trailer will never exist. Somehow, one wonders why this project was ever done. Sure to show Sandy Collora's abilities, but he'd done that with a real short film like his earlier movie "Batman: Dead End." <br /> <br /> But if you have to judge that for a second What that is is a great movie from a technical point of view. It looks great and is much more professional than you might expect at first glance, even if the people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" will know it better than if you approve with cardboard sets, even themselves costumes and a third part would expect a short film. Rate actor. The short does not always look impressive and obviously the budget was not sky high, but for the most part it's very impressive and professional, with beautiful costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> The short has built up a good fast and typical trailer, with a bit of a lot of pose-strokes that make it absolutely believable, but hey, it works well for the trailer style. There are some impressive shots, but also a few lame ones, mainly the Superman sequences. It was obvious the guy was standing at a moving car, pointing a camera at him from an angle. I even thought it was pretty ridiculous. But the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for that. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed to be a pretty good Superman / Clark Kent, although he's obviously not the best talented actor. Clark Bartram repeats his role as Batman again and Kurt Carley looked like a great Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast has served its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's especially interesting to see this short reinterpretation of the two most important superheroes of this film in the movies "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It's interesting to compare the style and character of these films with this one. It's really amazing and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> It's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer, but it wants to hungry for more, though you know there will not be more. What happened to the Waner Bros. plans, incidentally, that make a full-length Superman / Batman movie? I thought the development was going on a few years ago, but nothing has been heard of since. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman films were shot; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
