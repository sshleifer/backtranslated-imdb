This movie is charming and perfect in every way, if you want to feel good. If you love jazz music, this is a must. If you love to see lovable characters make you smile, a tear may pop in your eye and swing as if there's no tomorrow this movie is for you. If you're looking for an intense, deep, heavy work of art to analyze and analyze, it's best to stick to something by Darren Aronofsky (in other words - the reviewer djjohn relieves, you do not know when you'll see one!) My only complaint is that the movie was just too short. I guess I just have to look at it a few more times to get full.
