I've never seen four hours pass so fast when I saw this movie. This film gives Hamlet the power and art he should always have. Even these famous speeches are kept in a new and imaginative way. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and mastery of the role that defines the film. If you create a complete and complete version, so many holes will be filled and the tragedy will be re-evaluated despite the length. Where one would expect the dark, gloomy Klischeeburg, an opulent feast awaits us for the eyes. The only darkness comes from Hamlet itself, as it should. Worth your time, every four hours.
