This movie was one of my favorites from my childhood, and I have to say that the thief of Baghdad, unlike other films I liked during that time, stuck to its quality when I grew up. This is not just a movie that kids can enjoy but also for adults. The only downside is that you are behind the ?? bad effects (compared to today's effects) can not see more than if you were a child. I did not remember any of these effects, of course it was about ten years since I saw this movie when I was about eleven years old. Who then looks at effects? You're just looking for good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what this movie offers. In my opinion, this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. When I think about it, I feel like the Indiana Jones movies are very similar to this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure in one, creating a wonderful mix that will captivate you from start to finish. Although the film is old and the music and style of the films are clearly not modern, they do not manage to be dusty and old. All of this is due to the great story, the good direction and the good acting performance of the actors. This section features Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar), who provide mainly the comedic and cool elements of the film. Great movie and though an "oldie", definitely a "Goldie". I hope someone has the courage and the courage to publish it on DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
