Mat Spirogolou's family (Toby Malone) knows he's a talented footballer, and he's happy to be auditioning for a big club. They hope his cousin will take care of him when he arrives in the city. <br /> <br /> But the cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: one is a naive farm boy, the other a strict spendthrift that has mixed it up with drug dealers and gangsters. It is unlikely that Mat will have a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> After missing his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on his arrival in the city, Mat encounters further difficulties when a young biker takes him away in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably better known for his theatrical work, performs a remarkable feat as a bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs of a low budget, but like so many other low-budget films, it's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than is usual in a Hollywood blockbuster.
