Although this was obviously a low budget production, the performances and songs in this movie are worth watching. One of Walken's few musical roles so far. (He is a wonderful dancer and singer and also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - watch out for the cartwheel!) Also with Jason Connery. A great children's story and very sympathetic characters.
