Honost With you, I think that in this movie, everything was so good that there should be no reason why it did not go to the cinemas. The deaths in the movie are fantastic. The FX are awesome when used The story follows the little girl, but all in all this was a very good movie that I hope someday he gets the props he should get. The very first part of the movie is likely why it came straight to a video in which they killed a little boy, but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who had visited the mother's friend, the one from the house moved to try to become a writer. The property he buys turns out to be the place where the witch (Tooth Fairy) lives, and anyone who lives in their home or goes to their property is in grave danger. I do not really want to reveal anything, just some info, if you wanted to see this movie, it's worth the price
