Oh, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are a major component of a variety of horror films. This one has many. It is still Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, just too predictable. And what horror movie has no stupid people? This one is overflowing with backward victims who practically beg for their lives to be taken. Pet Semetary I found something scary. The way everything is set up was REALLY scary but not scary. For the most part, acting SOMEWHAT was believable, the excitement was not so exciting, but the level of entertainment is high; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans have to watch this movie, but like everyone else, an OK thriller awaits.
