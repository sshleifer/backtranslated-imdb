This movie is a true masterpiece. It's rare for you to come across such a heartwarming movie, full of fun, laughter and heartache, and a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound, a true family movie, tells the story of three brave pets making their way through the Rocky Mountains to find their owners along the way. One of the most amazing features of this film is the ability to give animals human personalities - the voice output is so good. Shadow is a wonderful figure, old, wise and brave, and watching him try to rescue Sassy in the river was a very moving moment. Chance - who would not love a dog like Chance? He must be the most roguish and lovable puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very funny for a cat - she had me in stitches when she mocked the keeper; "Here's Kitty Kitty Kitty ... not in your life, chubby." <br /> <br /> There were also many well-made emotional scenes, like Sassy over the waterfall (I was really scared for them), Shadow fell into the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic end. When all three pets return home ... including the good old Shadow! <br /> <br /> A favorite for all time - if you do not like this movie, do not like animals. Rent it or buy it now and you will leave happy memories that will last a lifetime.
