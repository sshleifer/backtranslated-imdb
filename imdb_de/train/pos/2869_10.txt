First off, I want to say, "Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing the movie 'Cinderella' on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Editions!) What will you do next? Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the lock !!!!!). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Disney stays in his 1950s animated classic movie" Cinderella, "a movie putting fairy tale films on the map, magical. We all know the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a coach, just to "Bippity-boppity-boo!" To say and of course to go home at midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a great old fairy tale that kids now like, now in movie form (as well as on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars
