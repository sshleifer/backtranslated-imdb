I think James Cameron may be my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was in all news and one of the greatest tragedies of all time. Well, James Cameron decided to make it into a movie, but two fictional characters should be in the limelight instead of the ship. Well, to the main review I would like to remind you that this is all one opinion and no fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the movie. <br /> <br /> So our main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). You do not bother too much, but look at that and you'll find out why they might get annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). I guess the main villain is bad luck, destiny, the hand of God (no blasphemy) or just Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all that and what do you get ?! Oh yeah! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The minor characters are: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (he was so nice), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many more. We also have today's treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). You add something to the story, something good. The action here is fantastic, especially in the second half the drama is just as good. In the end, you can let rainstorms or silent tears fall with your eyes. The story is simple and works. A treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds the drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her story about the RMS Titanic. Two lovers, separated by social layers and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are only a few shortcomings. I give Titanic, an incredible 86%
