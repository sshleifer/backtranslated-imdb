There have not been many films about aviation's Lighter Than Air aspect (LTA), but this is one of them and it's damn good. Just a funny movie you can watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the Navy Blimp operations of NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a sympathetic but Munchausen-like senior chief Ned Trumpet, a dedicated pilot whose big stories are so common that no one really believes him. Half the fun is almost at the end of the film as events prove that most of his fancier stories are indeed true. <br /> <br /> During the Second World War, the main plot revolved around bachelor Trumpet, who woos only a local widow at the end of a father-son relationship with the crippled son of the widow Jess. He said he would never be able to walk by doctors without crutches, Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and a Navy aviator helps restore the boy's crippled leg. Jess continues to become an officer in the Navy flying air strikes in Lakehurst, facing a whole new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> A very successful movie, but not without some crazy Hollywood dialogues past the technical advisers, and Beery's apparent inability to march in step. Otherwise, this film gets high marks for technical accuracy and gives a rare glimpse of the Navy's LTA operations. The box office scene, a swap between Trumpet and Jesse's future love interest Cathy, is an absolute shout.
