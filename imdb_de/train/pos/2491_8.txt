Budget constraints, time constraints, filming, filming, cutting, cutting ... This crew is a group of good young filmmakers. thoughtful in this script - yes, allegorically - wise in zero dollar effects, if only time and knowledge are available, and rely on actors, friends, and kindly others for their time, devotion, places; and get a first feature in the can, a 1-in-1000 thing. These guys are making movies. The good ones. Take a look at her shorts collection "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. And I can admit that working with them is the best thing you can do in business. I am slowed down by the harsh, insulting criticism of this film. I wonder if a reviewer has ever heard a word of dialogue, considered a thought or concept, or if the only thing desired from this work was the visual gore of hooking and slaughtering, to satisfy some mind-less view of it What horror should mean for an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" come to you. Do not claim what you expect just because it is included in the horror / thriller genre due to its supernatural premise. It is a drama with a depth that goes beyond how far you can put a blade into someone who has a reverence for a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain, but rather aims at the empathetic imagination of the other person to experience the suffering of others in spirit and soul. Mark Ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
