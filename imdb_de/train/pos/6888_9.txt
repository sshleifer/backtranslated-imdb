I watch movies to see which ones are good enough to distribute. Let's throw aside those who do not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on it. I'm just showing you how I came to see "The Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies are ending up on my desk and I'm actually all sitting through. I do not actually "look" anything, I usually occasionally look over to the TV as I scan for production value, performance, and story representation. If I notice something, I take the time to look at it. "Lou" got me dressed for the first few minutes, when I closed my laptop and turned my chair to the TV so I could switch on completely. I was fascinated throughout the movie. The story is well told, the characters are either lovable or disgusting (depending on the intention of the actor and the directors) and all played very well. Sometimes I've occasionally discovered amateur errors in camera work and editing, but due to the emotional nature of the story, these mistakes can easily be dismissed. I've heard other people's comments say that the film sometimes had tears in my eyes, sometimes extreme enthusiasm ... I laughed a minute and cried the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. Unfortunately, I could not earn it because, as the saying goes, I was one week late and one dollar was too short. That's the way it works sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure to see this, and I can not wait to see what kind of reaction it gets. Good luck and good luck, Bret Carr (if you read this), you are undoubtedly a talent to watch out for.
