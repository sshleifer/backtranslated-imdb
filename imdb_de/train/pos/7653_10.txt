Shot in the heart is wonderful. It shows brilliantly the plight of Gary Gimore, a convicted murder who has demanded death. Shot in the Heart shows the ordeal that Gilmore's family, torn by hate, went through. This movie is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
