Daisies is really a milestone on television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but in a world where fresh ideas are extremely rare, this show guarantees that you do not care if it's fresh or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I am fascinated from the beginning. Smart writing, stage-setting and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok, not exactly good) comparisons, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that there are no comparisons on TV. <br /> <br /> Really addictive and an absolute pleasure. Maybe like one of the Piemakers Pies that are mentioned in such a tempting way.
