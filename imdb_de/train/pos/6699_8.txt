When Sabrina came to our screens for the first time, I was about 12 years old and spent my teenage years watching the teenager, who gets into all sorts of strange compulsions. <br /> <br /> It has always been one of my favorite programs, the witch feeling of the sixties sitcom 'Bewitched', but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and uncomplicated, which made it pleasant to look at her. The characters in the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the Quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal favorite, pity that he left so early) Hilda and Zelda, their aunts started okay, but then irritated Mr. Kraft too, seeing as Sabrina's secret always a little closer. What I loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of family secrecy, and the learning of new spells, but over time it became more predictable. Too many characters came and went, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and decided to take Sabrina to college, which ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was self-absorbed in college, less magic, no spellbook, no aunts who lived with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring and I just watched what happened in the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed to be wrong, and Miles was just gone. In the last episode, I felt a lot better (SPOILER) when Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day to find Aaron dullard was great! All in all a great program if you forgot the poor last two or three series that reminded me of so many teen shows. Magical.
