My mother took me to this film when he came out around Christmas 1976. I loved him then and I love him now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbras hair, but I think she looks good and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who have copied this perpetual look! The bathtub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! The music is great too. This is the groovy 70s Babs at their best!
