I gave this movie such a high rating because it was really sweet, really funny and unpretentious. I watched this movie while walking in the Philly area and it was the centerpiece of a great evening with friends. The film is well written and well played, and although it feels more like a sitcom than a movie, that's not the movie. You just can not find those comedies that do not shock people to be funny. The film is about a Ukrainian housekeeper who works for a young, needy couple. Although she helps first, she soon adds more insanity than the couple she has chosen. Things keep getting out of control until ... you have to see! The joke made me laugh even after I left the theater. This movie just made me feel good. I can not wait to get it released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
