As I said above, four stars are just not enough. It's one of the best movies I've seen in almost 17 years of his life. For the people who do not really like or understand it, you do not have to have a real appreciation for art or you may have a short attention span. <br /> <br /> Even though I did not see all of his films I have to say that Spielberg is at its peak. It's very sad to see that films like "The Color Purple" are not that common, because I think we all need first-rate movie entertainment in these tough times. <br /> <br /> Films like these are more than just films; These are works of art that need more to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and did not receive a trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg was not even nominated for the best director! It should have swept the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only movies were so good ...
