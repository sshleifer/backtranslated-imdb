I saw that when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White like Lisa and the Meecy Mices were cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much sweets. What is sad, that Little Bunny Foo Foo, who shoots the Meecy Mices on the head, then a few wishes from a fairy Little Bunny Foo Foo, then he turns into a fool. This story is about Lisa, Snoodle and Doodle going to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent, the kids will like this show, watch new words, songs and them while playing.
