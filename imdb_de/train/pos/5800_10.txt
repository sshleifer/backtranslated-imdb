This is by far my most popular movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it at 16 !! It is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy every second of it and not only does the movie have big special effects, it also sends a great message to the teenagers of the audience that may sound crazy, but in fact the movie is really really cool. Although Michael Jackson has now been in a couple of new films, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is unbelievable !!! MOONWALKER IS A MUST SEE !!!!!!
