Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose the cast and applauded Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles that differed from those they had adopted in the past. Both show very restless people with warts, but make them sympathetic because of their humanity. The story is touching, but the performances are increasing. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable accomplishment whose search for romance opened my eyes to aspects of disability that I had not thought of before, but which were also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the movie ended abruptly, but better than a lengthy emotional manipulative end (see "Stepmom"). The very real English attitude encouraged my enjoyment - it was England in the 90s, both in cities and in the countryside, without being depressing.
