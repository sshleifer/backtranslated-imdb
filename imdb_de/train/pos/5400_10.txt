This film is a brilliant lesson in Japanese history that began at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate just before the Shogunate lost a major fight against the Loyalist who wanted to put the Emperor back on the throne to rule Japan. I really had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (aka Original Zatoichi) performs excellently as Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Human) Slayers of the Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes a holder of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke from Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultranationalist politician who murders his hitokiri gang, a crowd of high-ranking Western politicians, to achieve his political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to drink and spend on his whore. Okada's murders are becoming increasingly brutal as the movie progresses, and he's proud to have a reputation based on fear, wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It's a great portrait of the life of a simple samurai involved in politics and really too naive to realize what's going on. Only after he has been betrayed and tortured, and always with Sakamoto (a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and views on life. But too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give one brilliant performance. Every actor achieves his role. The sword fights are very unique and fast ... probably faster than many movies today ... <br /> <br /> Check if you have the chance !!!
