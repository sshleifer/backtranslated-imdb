I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. However, "Rob Roy" scored well above average on two fronts. First, I have rarely seen a "popular" movie in which the quality of dialogue was so high. There were many verbal slashes and strokes that accompanied the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood a principle that was rarely recognized. For a drama to succeed, not just a hero is needed, but a truly credible villain. If you do not have one, it is not much fun to root the good guys. And "Rob Roy" has not one but three - the Earl of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn and Archie. Also no one-dimensional villains, but fully developed and very uncomfortable. It takes a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - there are more dialogues and the accents are a bit hard, but it's a much smarter and subtler piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
