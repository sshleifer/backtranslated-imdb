please, future authors, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a bold and original story for the big movie before. brave, because the script has constantly taken a step, so that many fantasy films are safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and courageous. Especially when you think, "Oh, I've seen this before" or "I'm sure this will happen now" - StarDust would make an unexpected turn and get you more involved in the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with so much talent that the creators of this film fill me with awe. Robert De Niro is great and performs with such energy that he steals the show in every scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving "star" Yvaine. Other big names make excellent roles. I had the abundance that everyone tries to do their best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he "invented" for this universe - just outstanding. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie today in a preliminary exam the day before the official release and I hope it will be a great success. There is so much humor, but also exciting moments and delicate scenes. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the "frivolities" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the Witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the entertaining film # 1 of 2007, look and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> peace and love
