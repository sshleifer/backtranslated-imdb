Christina Raines plays a pretty model in New York who is looking for a new home and meets foreign neighbors to reveal a secret about the building and slowly find a climax at the end of the movie. This film contains all sorts of storylines, from the Roman Catholic Church to the Devil to the Gate to Hell, bizarre rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally to a number of talented famous actors and actresses who flood the movie. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly De Angelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum Forget about John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors are having a hard time - especially Burgess Meredith, who, as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat, is doing a good comic / dementia performance. Meredith is memorable as balm and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do, like Jose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it's just a cameo. The Sentinel is a fine horror movie with lots of psychological elements and some really scary scenes. The final scene is repugnant and yet daunting. I find something about the baseless sex and violence in the movie, especially the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was that really necessary? I do not think so. Also the father / daughter stuff was a bit much, but overall the movie works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner does a manual job and creates effective tension and scary movie moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
