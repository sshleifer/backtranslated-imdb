This is a masterpiece in B / W 35mm. The movie lets you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 in a bar and how much can be done there in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short film surprisingly brings you into a complex story of very few elements and step by step lets you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, lets your adrenaline rise with subtle details and is incredibly understandable for everyone, not low budgeted just for the critics of the cinema. Do not be scared. Well worth it for everyone, not just experts in the genre. <br /> <br /> Is not really much more to say, since the movie lasts just 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just looked at it online and could not understand why nobody had a few minutes to post a comment. <br /> <br /> It's really worth it to see it. 10/10.
