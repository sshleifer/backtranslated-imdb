IMPRESSIVE! <br /> <br /> This movie is, in my opinion, the best living testimony of what happened in NYC on 9-11-01, compared to everything shown by the big media companies. <br /> <br /> Outlets can only show you what has happened on the outside. This movie shows you what happened at INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It begins with a focus on a New York-based firefighter from New York who waits weeks for the first big fire to be called. The theme revolves abruptly with the SINGLE FLOOR of the first aircraft hitting the towers. They then get a seat in the front row while firefighters storm into the lobby of Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes before the crash of the second plane and the subsequent fall of Tower Two, you see firefighters reacting to the disturbing sound of people landing over the lobby. It's a sight you will not forget so soon. <br /> <br /> Heart-rending, tearing and very gripping from the first minute to the last minute, "9/11" deserves to be remembered as one of the best documentary films ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
