I really enjoyed this movie. Many Koreans will be familiar with this film as many of them have tutors when they go to school. The cinematography was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera were more irregular. However, the editing was very neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap opera. But this time she's playing a sweet tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very credible. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is that the characters' emotions are not over the top. There are many Korean romances in which the characters flow in front of the audience, and I always thought it was very stale. There was no such crap in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
