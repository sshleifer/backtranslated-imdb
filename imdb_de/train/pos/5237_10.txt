We all create our own reality or do we? This is the key question behind this highly original and masterfully explored investigation of the illusory nature of reality. A blend of Eastern and Buddhist philosophy with the visual chicane of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise, manages to solve the more cerebral question "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" Turn into a fascinating and entertaining 100 minutes. The film is about Bart, a writer who struggles with his screenplay "The Sea That Thinks". While sitting at his computer, the work begins to develop only as a description of his computer-based game and write the script. After a short while he is in a whirling puzzle in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a mischievous humor and impresses the viewer with a series of amazing visual tricks that deal with nature and the validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff's film challenges audiences on a number of levels to ask whether everything we see, touch, or taste is really what it seems, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is just one Trick is we play our senses.
