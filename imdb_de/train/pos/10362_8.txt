Meryl Streep excels in her nuanced and stoic performance as the notorious Lindy Chamberlain, who was charged with allegedly killing her own baby, Azaria Chamberlain, and using her alibi of raven dingoes in her defense. A CRY IN THE DARK is based on the book "Evil Angels" and is titled in its Australian release as being an ugly movie. It presents a scenario that is all too real for us in America: the witch hunt against a person who is considered an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. As someone who voiced their thoughts, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone just hard enough to continue his life despite their terrible ordeal, she was considered suspicious and hated it incomprehensibly, even if she knew it not killed her own child. The media began with a tightening of the noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon captured the entire nation on their sets as they routinely removed this family from the game. And through all this Lindy stayed as stoic as ever, even if her husband Michael fell apart. This attitude is, of course, the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may be, and people respond strongly to it. They want to see a desperate mother cry and occasionally faint in each round, not sit there and look blank. People do not understand that not everyone mourns in the same way, and when someone decides to stay strong, they begin to speculate. Meryl Streep embodies this corrupted woman, creating a cold, but unfeeling, woman who stands by her beliefs, even if they lose their freedom. Because of Sam, Sam Neill may slowly dissolve his character into despair - someone must, or the Chamberlains would be too distant, and nobody wants to see that. Except for the monster that has become the message medium at the time of this writing. They always eat train wrecks and feed the mutilated crap of the uninformed public.
