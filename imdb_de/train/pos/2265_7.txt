I'm a big fan of Vonnegut's work and I love this movie a lot, but I would not say that this is a Mother Night movie I read. When people say that Vonnegut is not able to film, I can think of two things. One is that many of his subjects are very close to the ankle or even taboo, despite the sometimes accusation that he chooses relatively "easy" goals for his satire. This means less every day that goes by in terms of filmability. Directors seem to enjoy breaking taboos these days, and I have high hopes for the version of "Bluebeard" that is now in production. It's amazing to believe that an innocent piece like Vonnegut's "Sirens of Titan" would probably have been the equivalent of "R" when it was filmed when it was released in the 50s tragedy that no one with a movie-enabled script to it yet has come. And in the current economic climate, I also hope that a director will look closely at "Jailbird", "Galapagos" and "Hocus Pocus". <br /> <br /> The other thing is his narrative style, on which irony comes irony of irony, but still weird. It seems impossible to objectify, and this seems to be the biggest obstacle to making great films out of his great novels, because the little comments that make up our reaction as readers are simply not possible in films, without too often awkward techniques Vonnegut said that the filmed versions of his work lacked a character who himself acted as author / narrator, and in his honor, "Breakfast of Champions" (the film) attempted to retain the comedy, and came to grief a bit of a Cropper, just like another turkey from a Vonnegut novel "Slapstick" in an even more spectacular way. <br /> <br /> Still, it is not wrong for a director to give us his subjective interpretation of Vonnegut and "Mother Night" is an excellent example of how a good director, as another critic put it, adds visual poetry to such a source gen can. But so much of the humor is lost, that although it is the same action, but not really, coming from the same novel I've read. If that had been so, I would probably have rolled in the hallways and laughed a few times when I saw it. For a reader of the novel, I think that a giggle is even forgivable in the end. However, the end of the film is really moving, and I think one of the film's successes is that you really can feel like someone has seen a razor switch between good and evil, and the jury is still there out. <br /> <br /> Alone and alone, a look is worthwhile. Technically, there are minor but blatant mistakes, especially in continuity, and it often looks shabby and theatrical, but usually meets an acceptable rating and occasionally shows considerable imagination and ingenuity. The spectacle is usually of a high order, even though dialogue may be stilted a bit by today's standards. <br /> <br /> It's pretty good to watch back to back with "Slaughterhouse-5" and that's indeed the case Vonnegut shot some "good" out there, mostly versions of his short stories - "Harrison Bergeron, "" Who am I now? " and a few other things, like, of course, the misfiring, filmed version of his very funny, but disposable, Happy Birthday Wanda June game. There was also an interesting piece, if it still exists, in the 70s, "Between Time And Timbuktu", which Vonnegut did not seem to appreciate, even though he was involved in his production because he felt it was him misinterpreted in its generality. He said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments that were done in the story of HG Well's "The Island of Dr. Moreau," but for many people it was an excellent introduction to his work. <br /> <br /> But if the movies do not let you go to the superior source material, they do not do their job. <br /> <br /> As the man said, more or less the big show is in your head.
