I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. The director? I do not have many things about him ... and I do not do anything. The script is good, that's for sure. Just a few words about this movie, which is weird, strange and dark, but it's good. I saw it a few years ago and never saw it. I want to see it over and over again. I know that I will not get enough of it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is fine. The movie should have taken longer, I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping that the movie would be part 2. Too bad it did not happen. Jason Patric: You are the man! very good movie the end. :-)
