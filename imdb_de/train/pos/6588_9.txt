After seeing several episodes of this series, I've come to the conclusion that television producers lack any form of originality. Here's an old sci-fi standby technique packed ingeniously in the form of a truly original concept - and yet they can almost always just get it to work. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! The male actors control their profession reasonably. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos for the hero and his more than sympathetic side kick. And most episode plots are tasty. So what could be wrong? How about those, the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actresses selected to portray them? <br /> <br /> The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series so that the final product looks like a failed cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> The episodes will expire whenever the female guest star or recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are all incredible in their roles, and you do not really have to see them to know that they are not able to fulfill their acting duties. A blind man could say it. Just listen to how they talk. They provide their dialogue with all the drama and impact of a 16-year-old at high school prom. Who would believe that these women are doctoral researchers, senators, officers and doctors? <br /> <br /> If the producers have the choice between Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? And of course the series suffers. Pity!
