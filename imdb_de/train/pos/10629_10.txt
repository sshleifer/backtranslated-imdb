Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a frying pan. , , If you do not mind the psycho-thriller or the horror movie and have a special place in your heart for the twisted, this is the movie for you. An amazingly well-developed first film entitled "Hate of a Minute" attracts mainstream hits like "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics like "Army of Darkness". The cut and the effects are well done, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio weaves a complicated tale of agony that describes both the Bible and the writings of Poe. At a time when the big budget of big name films lacks much substance, the independent film has revived this dying feature. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, watch "Hate of a Minute".
