I've read over 100 of Nancy Drew's books, and if you're not smart enough to look at it, Nancy Drew was the movie of a young Nancy Drew, not the 18-year-old who's not yet to school Books are over. That was when she was sixteen. So of course she would not be as smart as the one in the book, considering she's only in tenth grade. Besides, I found the movie very cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate, in her character and sweet. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they were obviously not old enough to be in a serious relationship as it is in the books. It was a sweet PG movie I thoroughly enjoyed because unlike most people my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or obscenity.
