This is one of the best movies I have seen in years! I'm not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she's honored as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is superb as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister Sophie is hysterical as Miss Bates. And look at the beautiful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. What a gentleman! Whoever claims to have sex and violence in a movie to do well has never seen Emma. I think that's what sets it apart from so many others - it's noble. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can see with the whole family, or looking for a romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is the movie. With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes and a great cast (did I mention the beautiful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
