I love this program. Period. I have not looked very long, probably only about six months, but it is now my favorite show and will probably take a while. I love all the characters except that I'm not really into Donna. I'm not sure why. I just do not think it's funny, and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Apart from her, I find the rest of the cast pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric's parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not hate the eighth season. I still watch it and it makes me laugh. But compared to previous seasons, it's not good. Randy is terrible. The final was neat, nothing special, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to go, but oh well. I have the fourth season on DVD, and eventually I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of my funniest episodes, in my opinion, were 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandma's Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I've seen so far. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
