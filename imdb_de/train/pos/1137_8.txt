This is very funny. You know, just how a comedy should be. It also looks very good, as a Hollywood Spectacular should do. What do you want more? Howz has a very good Sally Fields. She's a lot better here than anything else I've ever seen her, and she looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why she is a star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, all eyes are so good. I pretended to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. We do that where you look very fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They do not do that in Soap Dish at all. Great. The eyes have it! (Sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many great performances that it's fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. There's a whole workshop with Kevin Kline that's about subtle oversteer. Roger that? Yes, he is damn good. So does Robert Downey, Jr., who has since played the Slick, Slimy Executive. Although not the most gifted actress, Cathy Moriarity is so charismatic and intriguing, especially when she's angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives it a bit flat Zing. OK, no whoopi bashing, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then there's the hair. Soap Dish was made at the end of the BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous Doos are like a great personality in their own right. They are getting bigger and darker, just like you. Yes, we have pictures. <br /> <br /> Soap dish is better than I thought it would be better, I wanted it. I'm fed up with movies that tell me to take care of flat, self-centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV soap actor. Soap dish seems to be happy just to make me laugh at you. Thank you.
