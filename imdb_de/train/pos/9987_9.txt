The story has moved me a lot, and because I'm going through something similar with my own parents, I've really joined together. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once alive and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and with which they have to live. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. There's probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing was shown - it was just so nicely done. All in all, the movie's look was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good at this picture, he humanizes a man who moves down. I never liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - simple enough to tie us up, but not enough to hold on to.
