First off; I am an avid fan of Modesty's and have read the comics since my childhood. I found the earlier films about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, FOCKT! <br /> <br /> Let's go: Mrs. Blaise works for a casino, a band of robbers comes by and she starts to play for the lives of her friends. If the robber wins a round, she has to tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the employees is free. (Sounds silly, yes, well, I can not explain so well.);) <br /> <br /> She tells him that she grew up in a war zone, with no parents or friends, that she helped you has old man in the refugee camp and how they flee live by the rules of nature. They hunt for food and teaches them to read and fight. When they approach civilization, they go to war, and when they are brought for rebellions, they are shot at and the old man dies, leaving them alone in the city. She meets the man she is working for. and here the story ends. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is a great fight and the line is totally cool. Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! As modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic. <br /> <br /> Feeling awkward, Modesty also hears a slightly broken accent, but that's not relevant because the comic book can do nothing. Speak aloud, but certainly have some accent. (Not to mention that it's weird that everyone in the Balkans speaks English.) <br /> <br /> The show is really good, even the kid who plays the young Blaise has to applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part has to be where she rips her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! Really great! : D I can not wait for the real adventure to start in the next few movies! <br /> <br /> Take a look, you will not be disappointed!
