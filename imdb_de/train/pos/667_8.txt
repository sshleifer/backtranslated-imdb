Although I've been a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, I had not seen any of his Australian films until The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise. Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer who was asked to defend five indigenous people accused of murdering another Aborigine. For David's colleagues, it is a clear case of drunks and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick punishment. But David believes that the murder is a puzzle related to tribal rituals. In the course of his investigation, he not only learns things about his clients, but also about himself. To reveal more, it would be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. I can only say that this film is going in directions that nobody will expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this film a fascinating film: Chamberlain's play, for example; but also the performances of David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into tribal secrets; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an ancient Native American who is a spiritual leader. The relationships between these three characters make up the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> But there is also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the movie. David has dreams that warn him about the future. In Australia, terrible weather, storms, hail, and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing but pollution. But it's also related to the case David defends. How it relates to it is one of the big revelations of the movie. From small events, Weir manages to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression that suggests future horrors without really showing anything. Charles Wains score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. The photography is pretty good too. Russell Boyd, Weir's longtime DP, who won an Oscar for Master and Commander in 2004, shows a dark, scary world full of secrets. <br /> <br /> I also find it remarkable that it is not the case for a Native American movie. You will not become an indictment of white culture or a luscious celebration of its traditions, such as dances with wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too smart to be so simple. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating and upset viewers who expect to finish a movie if it all makes sense. But for those who do not enjoy strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
