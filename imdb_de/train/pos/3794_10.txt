"Our Song" tells us the life of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - best friends hang at the end of the summer. The adolescent summer - even though we do not know the signals and landmarks of this special site, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is / was the same for all of us. A lazy recovery from the pressure and turmoil of the school. Welcome heat and idleness. <br /> <br /> But if this experience of puberty is universal, the 90s downtown is a different place than most of us - maybe a foreign country like any other. Young bodies carving new silhouettes, attracting new territory ... the maze of growing up. The young spirit comes in, speaks for itself and says that I am, I want to try to be. It is / has always been like that. But that's what Brooklyn looks like in the late '90s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the author / director of this film project, but he recognizes those who have brought him suggestions. The opening title slide, A Movie From, seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the movie we know it's a real one. [The closing titles also have some of the most valuable and valuable credits I've read.] Jan McLaughlin's vivid audio recording deserves special mention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who's telling this story - it's his three Graces Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the real, their interactions have the fire of true friendship and the focus of reality. This is not a music video short description that talks about the lives of teenagers. It has the seriousness of the long, unblended look. <br /> <br /> When we hang out with them, we do not feel completely enclosed, but we feel privileged to listen. These are real voices that speak with clarity about the crises and stupidity of everyday life. We are witness to the modern mathematics of youth life - how their problems are interpreted, calculated, summed and solved. Small scenes illustrate big thoughts. Lanisha is hanging out with her father on his security job - that's the only way she can spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them, but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a coherent scene, Lanisha defends her father against her mother, and we see how much she has to love them both so that they can love her. Later, the three friends were in the dark, sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny children are and how tragic, how realism pounding idealism these days. And in the end, Maria, who just walks down the street, is a little story in her own right. We see how she has the courage to keep all her fears and doubts at bay. It demonstrates for us the strength needed to embrace the fragility that makes life worth living. <br /> <br /> `The greatest gift of our song is that we really feel the terribly fleeting nature of friendship. one day, alive and invigorating, the next day's intimacy can simply turn and drift away. It's awful, but that's it, is not it?
