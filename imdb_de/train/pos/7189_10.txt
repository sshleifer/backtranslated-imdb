My favorite character in movies, but in almost all of them, the character of Zorro has a small piece of cloth as a mask and if the rogue can not say who is under that cloth then they are stupid. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Zorro's Fighting Legion" (1939 series), the mask fills his entire face, making it a real secret who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But still, Zorro is one of the best characters in movies, and to bring it up to date, I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is enormous. But I really like the series of the 30s / 40s very much. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
