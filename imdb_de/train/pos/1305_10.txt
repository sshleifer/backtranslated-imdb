This film caught me off guard when he started in a caf√© in Arizona and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy", 04 decides to have something to eat. sexy waitress While Rex steps out of the cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him, "ARE YOU FAST?" and then hell breaks loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), 'Dressed to Kill', '80, is a television reporter, always looking for a news scoop to send. Maggie winds up in a hot tub and Rex comes to her and asks her to tell her he wants a western-style show with the local top policeman in town. This is another movie, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only actors to help this picture together!
