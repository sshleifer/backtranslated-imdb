I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was pretty good. It was the actual LAPD crime scene video that bothered me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that the general audiences would like to see people brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. Sorry Lion's Gate, this was an unbelievably bad idea! <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a moron and abused the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is hopelessly deep in drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that led to the notorious Wonderland murders. How exactly was Holmes involved in the killings? We may never know the whole truth about the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the movie does a good job anyway.
