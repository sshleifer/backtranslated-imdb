Oh, where are you going, my little one, kid ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> I remember to those shows when they first aired in Disneyland. I remember sitting there electrified by the explanations of Werner Van Braune on rocket science. I watched history, science and humor being woven into a gripping story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what a treasure they are. I saw her last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who would not even come into the room at first, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. As she watched, I watched her, and in the end she was almost as deep as me. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a young woman with own women ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. However, there is much information that is still fairly accurate, and the overall picture is still impressive. I thought my daughter's teacher could show her to her class, not just as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as entertaining and easy-to-understand lessons in the story. <br /> <br /> Turn around and turn around, turn around and again ... you wonder how much has really changed in 50 years.
