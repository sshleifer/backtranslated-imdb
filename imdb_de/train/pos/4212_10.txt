Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently buys a top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Jean Peters is also a tough Breitling who is used by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley as a courier. It's a film noir at its best and although the performances are very good, it's the great actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. When Moe, a tired street vendor who sells neckties (and also sells information), she's great in a role that earned her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated for an Oscar six times and never won. This should have been the role that cut it for her!
