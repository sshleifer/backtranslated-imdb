NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) Another weird premise from the director of the movie "Cube". This time, there are two main characters who find themselves and their home is placed in a mysterious white void. There is literally NOTHING outside their small two-story home. Surely fascinating, but I thought that the comedic tone that established itself for this film from the beginning was extremely unimaginable. There certainly has to be some humor ... and I have no problem with the humor that was ultimately derived from the plight of our two heroes (their last "showdown" was definitely a joke) ... but I really think that the movie really good It would have been much better if it had been anchored in reality in the beginning. After watching the movie, I saw the "Making of" feature on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost completely "weird" and makes a completely different (and slightly better) movie. In the last half hour of the movie things really start, similar to the last movie "Primer". The actors are fine if they do not overdo the comedy show. They are really believable in their more "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write off this movie halfway as a failed experiment ... but that eventually convinced me. (And keep looking at the credits for the last scene ... just do not ask me to explain it.)
