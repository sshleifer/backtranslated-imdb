"Rich in Love" is a slice-of-life movie that takes the viewer into the action of a somewhat quirky Charleston, SC family. Highly romantic, beautifully shot, well written and played - "RIL" washes you like a summer breeze, while its motionless movements breathe life into the characters, so you'll feel like an old family friend at the end of the movie. > <br /> A wonderfully crafted, character-driven film by the director of "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL", is a somewhat obscure little "sleeper" who will appeal above all to a mature audience.
