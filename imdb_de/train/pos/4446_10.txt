Yes, I call that a perfect movie. Not a boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly lesser-known actors and actors, a large number of characters, all clearly defined and all having clear motives I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, sharp black-and-white photography, a fitting soundtrack. an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is captivating and works. It's one of those high-quality images that Hollywood's pride should rest on. The goal that everyone should strive for. Barbara Stanwyck is just amazing. There was nothing this actress could not do, and she was always melodramatic. No hysterical outbursts on this woman - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and conveys true feelings at the same time. One can add that she also had many good parts during her long career, and this is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title goes very well with this movie. It's about desires, about human desires that everyone can understand. Actually nobody seems to plan in this movie, all characters are impulsive, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that this usually leads to complications makes the dramatic content that I do not want to go into here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this movie says about youth, about the tires and about the need to compromise. The film I associate most with this film is Alfred Hitchcock's shadow of a doubt that creates a similar atmosphere of idealized yet caricatured Small Town America. The story bears a certain resemblance to Fritz Lang's much harder film Clash by Night, which was filmed a year earlier and in which Stanywck plays a similar role. I can also recommend it.
