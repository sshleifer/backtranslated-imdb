About a year and a half ago my dad told me about The French Doors. I found it interesting enough, but I did not try to find it anywhere. About a year ago, I remembered this movie and thought, "Why not?" And tried to find him on the internet. sometime after about a week I found it in nuclear films. I called my dad to the computer and said to him, "Hey dad, I found this scary movie that you told me centuries ago!" He smiled at me, turned and switched off the light so that it was jet black from the computer screen, and told me to see it. I started well ... When he started to worry about what was there, I found it very nervous. At the end I pushed my chair back and I got up ... that made me jump: P If you have not seen this movie yet, I can highly recommend it, because it is worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time, it is still worrying. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM!
