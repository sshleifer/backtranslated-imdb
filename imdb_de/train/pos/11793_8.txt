I'll watch the series as soon as possible. I try to see everything on Star Trek. This is month 3 and I am now in the third season of TNG and I have already gone through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first recap episode in the TNG series. After watching the shows, these clips were fresh in my head, but I noticed that some of them were shot again because the movie looked better. Season 1 always seemed to me very dark and ugly - and the actors looked stupid, as if they did not fit into their own skin. <br /> <br /> The show basically consists only of the best hits of the happiest and the saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise by that time. The Data and Riker scene in the holodeck is a classic moment of the new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd Officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority as First Officer and Riker beats the living CRAP out of the Klingon. Then the admiral enters a good, but good. This whole episode is a reminder that a lot of crazy, great things happened in only 2 seasons, 5 more before the start and a handful of movies! At this point in the series, they really begin to develop the feelings that connect Riker as Imzadi with Deanna Troi. They have mentioned the fact to this point, but they do not yet have to take advantage of it. The record shows that the ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first," stating that she has close relationships with Riker and is deeply rooted in an emotional relationship. This episode further proves that there will be a long romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here's the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By At this point in the series, the production value is up to date and Star Trek TNG has got in the way Settled on science-fiction giants to which he was destined. Seeing this as an adult again, I now see what BIG ACTORS offers in the Star Trek universe. You really need to create a new ST show set after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would have been nice too.
