An outstanding cast makes this film a success; All characters are very well developed and it is obvious that the actors made this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not the expected comedy, but rather a carefree look at trying to regain youthful glory, rather than rejoicing humor. For music fans, there are a few subtle clues that are in themselves intelligent. <br /> <br /> I hate to make direct comparisons with other films, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker movies I can not help him: Imagine if The Commitments actually grew up - and then tried to recapture that fame 25 years later.
