I went into this movie and knew nothing about it, and I really enjoyed it. There was a lack of authenticity and credibility. Some of the things the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and many of the script seemed to be ad-libbed (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen, excuse my ignorance), but the entire audience in the theater laughed so hard , Not even in the jokes in the film itself, but in the entire movie. Acting reminded me of Seinfeld's acting, where he does not try to laugh at his own jokes - they are crazy, but if you do not take the movie too seriously, you can really appreciate the actors' humor, not the CHARACTERS. If you are looking for a casual movie and like Woody Allen, I can definitely recommend it!
