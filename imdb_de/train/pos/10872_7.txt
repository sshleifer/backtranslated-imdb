Election marks the second Trial Society themed film directed by Johnnie To. <br /> <br /> Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, the two nominees selected for the position The chairman of the Ho Sing Society, a 100-year-old experimental society. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who stays cool at all times, Big D is not just impatient, he also thinks he's at the top of everything. Lok was elected next chairman for 2 years. In order to gain total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be passed on with a Dragon Baton representing power and authority. Big D was extremely dissatisfied with the outcome that he was not elected as the next chairman after paying a handsome number of bribes to Council members. He ordered his man to fetch the baton before that locomotive fell into Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D gets the baton, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the theme films of the experimental society, where not much bloodshed is required. Johnnie To brings the greed of the people into the film, where in other theme films of the process society is often used bloodshed to show how people's greed can cause the death or downfall of a human. However, no single projectile is used, as election campaigns are rarely involved in elections. It is the fight of jokes that elevates Election out of the rest. <br /> <br /> Apart from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to be spoken throughout the movie, masculinity rules the entire movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who appeared in Tos's previous film, are cast as a covert cop and gangster who sold his life to the gang. Along with a few seasoned actors performing in the film and the great script, this is the only HK film to represent the 2005 Cannes Fil Festival. <br /> <br /> Wahl has barely denied critics seeking another process society theme film.
