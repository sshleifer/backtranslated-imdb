A very unique sci-fi animated film, and honestly, I love the uniqueness no matter which direction it is in, better or worse. This French film is very interesting to see, the technique part is innovative, like "Waking Life", which I recently reviewed. <br /> <br /> It took quite a while to get used to the black and white style, but eventually I love it, the sketchy pictures are really fancy! The contracted future world is a symbol of the ultimate goal of humanity, which I adore. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for a sci-fi, not so intriguing, but it's fine, as in some Hollywood products. a huge conspiracy about the eternity of the human being, a bit of clich√© and the twisted end is not so convincing, some developments are just too plain and bland and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think 'I'm just in love with the style this movie shows, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> Over the eternity of life, I think most people have come to an agreement that we do not want eternity, because it breaks down. We value the meaning of life because it is limited and meaningful , If everyone can live forever, the world becomes a disaster and a mess. It's hard and heartbreaking to let someone you love, but it's also a way to show that our lives are real and all the emotions fill your life and make the world colorful and vibrant.
