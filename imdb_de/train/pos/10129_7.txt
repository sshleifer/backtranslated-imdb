And so began the biggest television comedy! It's been 12 years since the very first episode, but it has continued with the same spirit until the last season. Because there are "friends" based on quotations. Extraordinary situations take place with six friends who will never go from heart: Let us thank Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! At our first meeting, we see Rachel dropping a guy (in the church, how ... (understanding), Monika's search for the "perfect guy" (there's no perfect guy, why are you all so obsessed with women?) ?) and how your marriage can be ruined if the partner of your life discovers that she is a lesbian until we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes ... ENJOY FRIENDS!
