There are some comments on this film that say it is a bad and stupid movie, and such an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted that he acts in it. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, even if the film is weird and has some flaws, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that it turns the movie into something great. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemical scene about the consecration of wine in cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe in being a priest? even a cocked ?? it can turn into Christ's blood, the scene may be bizarre. But for someone who has been educated in a Catholic setting, it is very emotional, even if it is quite uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the younger priest is hugely shocking. But it is played very well. Pierre Fresnay transforms the crazy act of murder into something that is understandable within the temporal insanity of his character. The tortured person disfigured Morand, who returns to his duty in that dreadful way.
