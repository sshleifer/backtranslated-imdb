Sammi, Curr, a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, trying to censor his music !! (similar to real life Dee Snider, by Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Sammi Cure, who was killed in a fire, was to play at an old high school on Halloween to dance. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan and the only one who knew how Sammi was and what he felt (or did he?) Nuke, the DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of Sammi's latest record, Eddie , But when Eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds Sammi talking to him about the dead and telling him what to do back to the thugs at his school who hate him and his music. Everything works until Sammi starts killing !! A great movie and must-have for fans of heavy metal hairbands, with a great soundtrack from Fastway, and if you do not know how the songs sound or know and do not like Fastway, they've changed their voice a bit and it sounds as well like the more famous Cinderella or Ratt. Is the movie a real horror movie? Well, that depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a slasher, with a lot of killing or just scary. This movie is not enough deaths, nor can it be called a action, comedy, drama, suspense or thriller, so I would guess it must be a horror. So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' on the Midnight Soul, your soul !!" Then Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is right for you. I mean, "what are you scared of, it's just rock 'n' roll!?!"
