And I gave him a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it rocked damn good. By the time there were so many other shows tied to toys / games, this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others have said, it was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> For that reason, the show was unfortunately doomed to failure. So far you have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more comes out. <br /> <br /> What happens when I watch it now 20 years after its first appearance? The writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition ... I hope for more DVDs or even a series of all episodes in the right order ... The DVDs are good, but I do not think the stories are in the right order, but still the show rocked.
