Valliant is trying to use a mine catastrophe as a vehicle to declare that director's dislike for the war. The audience not only learns a lot about early mining rescue procedures, but we learn that Europeans had pacifists between the First World War and the Second World War (for lack of a better term). The speeches made by both country representatives at the end of the film are inspiring when it comes to time. Although the revised edition is temporarily "cut off" by the transmission technology of early foreign films, this film has proven itself in many ways. Character analysis, lighting techniques, historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many writers and filmmakers. Pabst went to Direct and put Weil & Brecht's "Three Penny Opera" starring in front of the original star, Lotte Lenya.
