"The Godfather" of television, but apart from its acclaimed characters, the two are nothing else. Tony Soprano has to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony actually belongs to two families - in one family he is a loving father, but not such a perfect husband, and in the other family he is a reckless smartass. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually stem from his mother Livia, who is suspected of suffering from a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character. However, Bracco and Marchand are nowhere near as well-known for their equally talented accomplishments as the psychiatrist and mother. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are praised for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend and is quite convincing and laid back. Chianese, the only returning actor who actually appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay" but not remarkable (with the exception of Iler's impressive performance in the penultimate episode "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and exaggerated, but the show is too strong to hold them back. Even though the show lasts more than six years, it does not have a boring or predictable moment anymore. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
