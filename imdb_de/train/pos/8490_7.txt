I recently watched this movie in my International Business Class. I did not expect anything else than another boring documentary (not to say that I do not love the documentary.) I'm just unlucky in films of this class.) Imagine my surprise when this film, which is actually a movie, arose. <br /> <br /> This film tells all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they have to work together to get somewhere. The Kulturkampf shows how different the world is and how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes and wakes us up. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is doing business or simply wants to laugh because he is funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it! cheers
