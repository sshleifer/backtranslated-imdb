I was so impressed with Doug McGrath's film version of the Jane Austen novel "Emma," and I loved the music of Rachel Portman so much that one day I went to the video store and discovered that the two had reunited. Nicholas Nickleby "I rented it right away, without any other consideration. <br /> <br /> I've read the book, and for those overcritical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I do not know what McGrath could have done otherwise better capture the spirit and key elements of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two-hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!) And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I must confess that I am She did not know her that well when I first saw it in the theater, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress! <br /> <I'm surprised by those who criticized the movie because of its lush landscape This is one of the things that I enjoy and I look forward to seeing historical pieces in the English countryside, and the beautiful backgrounds of the film add significantly to its attractiveness If your idea of ​​escapist fare is a little worse then you might want to hire something like "Death Wish III". <br /> <br /> The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the history and soundtrack of entertainment that does not have to come back. McGrath is a marvel in choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential to conveying the complicated romantic intrigues that occur in this story. This refreshing film could also be a clinic for how beautiful a movie can be minus sex, violence or even a vicious antagonist. The story is often amusing, lovable and sometimes very touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many competent Jane Austen book customizations, but this is without question my favorite.
