First, I want to say how great that is. It is amazing and sometimes shocking. At least I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie. I can definitely endure a boring movie, but that's far from boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His austere realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It's a heartbreaking story of two back and forth (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) building a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texan, comes to New York to make him rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who can barely pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager', but soon both men can not find a job that leads to food being stolen. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. You can not get Joe a girl until you meet a lady at a party. Joe earns some money and soon Ratso Ratso takes a dream place in Ratso, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbreaking and yet some of the biggest moments of the movie. With MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing look at life in the city.
