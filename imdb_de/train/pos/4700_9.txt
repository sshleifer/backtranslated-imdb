I could not believe the low rating of 5.6 on IMDb for Johnny Dangerously the moment I wrote this review, and I thought I needed to do something to promote this memorable piece of comedy as well as possible. In order to get such a low rating, people who are entitled to vote must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very flat, open mind. If you do not like funny movies, do not look at them! This film combines absurd humor, very good storytelling and great tempo dictated by the numerous running gags, and has found its way into my DVD collection. And all this without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there, and of course the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite organized crime films. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to a lot of people and presented it with no particular expectations (except maybe watching a comedy) - the condition in which I think you should watch any movie - everyone enjoyed it very much. It's fine, it can not be seen for long, and there's absolutely no slowing down in the story's development, which I find quite straightforward. Sure it's not perfect, some gags are a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially considering other opinions. That's why I rated this film 9 out of 10. This film, in my opinion, is a forerunner of "top secret" and "spaceballs" in the field of absurd but thought-out comedies. What is more and more absurd nowadays, if you limit the thought and genius. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people imagine to be understood, if at all. As a final word I would like to say: look at it yourself, do not follow the average Joe sentence and if you do not like that, then you really know that it was not good for your taste, but understandable in my opinion is unlikely ,
