First, I have to start with this comment that I'm a big nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think it's the biggest horror series ever. Freddy is the Boogeyman for me! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who wanted to be the last chapter, is a funny movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less scary, which I agree with. And that's exactly the point in my opinion. This movie exists so that we can get to know Freddy a bit better, who he is, who he was and how he became the man who pursues our dreams. For some people it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know, because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people do not like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really enjoy them, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland, waiting to scare hell out of you. This was the first and it was great. Over the years, Freddy killed more and more people, and no one ever got rid of him. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's realm of terror. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I also liked the atmosphere of the movie very much. No more kids in Springwood, just crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is great, especially the opening song titled '' I'm Awake Now '' by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it's so underrated. Maybe it gets misunderstood or I have a different taste! Anyway, all Freddy fans should see it. It has many scary moments and also funny moments and many cameos! Get ready for something different and you will not be disappointed.
