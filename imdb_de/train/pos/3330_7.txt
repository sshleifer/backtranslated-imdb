I was not just an extra in this movie, I saw it in Boston as a sold out movie. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans crowded into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon Star is this cute comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. The desire is for the Red Sox to win the World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, Fallon is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and laughs the most. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt that supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for this role. All in all, all the Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
