This movie is so great. It's probably back in the 40s and Meg Ryan's characters who are known as "intelligent." Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And everything about it has a magical feeling. Every time I see it, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl's movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love the music. The violin is great. But other than that, I think it's a nice story and everyone should watch it.
