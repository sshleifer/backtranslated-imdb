I was really impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to be emotionally connected with everyone. The creators of this movie really hit the nail on the head when it comes to creating characters from real life and pulling the viewer into their world. Besides, the music is great. They employed some independent artists to do the film music and the soundtrack, and they did a fantastic job for the film. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (as I did), I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Paget Brewster is also very beautiful in this film. Reason enough to try it.
