Anne Bronte's epic novel THE ZENANT OF WILDFELL HALL was to be studied and read in schools, libraries and living quarters of the peoples. It's a fantastic story telling the "real" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mother struggling to keep her son away from her brutal husband. It's similar to today's stories we see and hear, and I believe that people can learn a lot by reading this book. Based on possible true experiences the author had in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, it's a great version of the book and very moving. I'm sure Anne herself would have been happy with the production. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and great locations.
