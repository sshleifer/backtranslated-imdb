I saw this movie for the first time at a local station in the horror show on Sunday afternoon around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was only a small child at the time, but I loved it and was not really that scared. I thought that there is such a cool and very original story. When I think back, I'm still surprised that it was shown uncut on TV V. during those years. I have searched, watched and loved this movie ever since. You'd think John Waters worshiped this movie. It does not have to be just a scary movie, but one of the sloppiest, filthiest movies ever made at that time. And, surprisingly, you do not hear that this film has the cult that was acquired after a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" over the years. It has a cult pursuit, but I think it should really become a cult classic. As far as I know, this was released just before the release of Blood Feast, making it one of the first true "Gore" movies. In fact, this film contains elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a small Russ Meyer thrown in for a reason. Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who likes the trashy, slippery black and white horror movies from the movie in the early '60s (I think the date was 1960 at the end).
