Probably the two most important meanings of "Elmers Pet Rabbit" is that the crazy leporid in "A Wild Hare" now has a name and that he says his famous saying, "Of course you realize that this means war!" for the first time. For the most part, the crowd of Termite Terrace was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this long-tailed rogue. For hardcore fans of this genre it's certainly a must, but others probably will not have a reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake, it's pretty funny what makes Bugs Bunny with the ever-gullible Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things that can be found throughout the cartoon. I recommend it.
