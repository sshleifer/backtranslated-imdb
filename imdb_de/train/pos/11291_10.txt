Did anyone buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real (not reel) pilot, seen throwing his wings in the air and then snapping his fist as he receives his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He's only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like the movie. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy when he was only 24 years old. Do we know the movie studio that did it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen it in a video store like Blockbuster? I wish they would provide whole catalogs of these old movies, as it is so cheap to make DVDs nowadays. Many Thanks.
