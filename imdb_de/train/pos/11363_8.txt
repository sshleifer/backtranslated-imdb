Imagine you were so disabled by a bureaucracy that a man spends eight years of his life and has a nervous breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually on his own! The killing technique is clear, but a government unwilling to admit the truth lets a monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think that my job is exhausting, I only remember the true story behind this wound film. The duty fulfillment of the main character was presented masterfully by Rea. The comical (and sometimes almost tragic) relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this movie one of my favorite films of the last 5 years. The capture of one of history's worst mass murderers drove me to the edge of my seat. Although not nearly as well advertised and talked about as "Silence of the Lamb's", the plot was just as exciting. Rent or buy this movie today!
