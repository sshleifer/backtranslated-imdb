This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school who was so similar. There are many "facts" in the story that are not entirely accurate, and Mr. Wuhl shows them very well in an unforgettable way. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl teaches a class of film students, but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way in which he reveals some well-known fallacies in world history, and strive to bring them into that To shape the brain of his students. The use of live actors performing "skits" is also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in turning the story they learned as a child upside down.
