I've seen the trailer for this movie several times and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like he's going to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes off it (that caught my attention). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for the split second, looks awesome. I think this movie will be a hit and my many people will be seen again and again.
