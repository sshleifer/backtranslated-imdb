This movie is so wonderful that it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide which one is better, the book or the movie. Whoopi Goldberg is awesome, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, could be funny, happy and miserable all at the same time. Overall, the film was well staged by Steven Speilberg and should not be overlooked. 9.10
