Does anyone know the exact quote about "Time and Love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick on the move? It had to be you? He spoke with Charlie and Annna in church as they left. If not, I have to borrow the movie. That was a great movie. I also loved serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my only true love (my soulmate) and although I had the experience of meeting him when I least expected it, I was not ready for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Although we were married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I became complacent and took his love for granted and he kept it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally went into rancor, but we are still hurt and angry and disbelieving about the way it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn and we are now separated for 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I was still waiting to reconcile myself with my only love. I can NOW appreciate this strong feeling in me and the quote from Father Fitzpatrick is true for me. <br /> <br /> I know if he has healed enough to trust me again, we will marry again. <br /> <br /> Do not always get the duty and take the true love for the supplement! It was the hardest lesson of my life. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is EXCEPTIONAL and IMPORTANT! This movie is deep and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it should be, no matter what, it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even if it is the second time! Many Thanks!
