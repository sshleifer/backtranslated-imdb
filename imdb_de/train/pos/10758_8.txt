9/11 is a classic example of Cinema Verite, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case by New York firefighters fighting one of the most extraordinary events in world history. It's all small, unobtrusive, handheld video cameras that are often betrayed by the poor quality of most filming (and by the director who often wipes the screen with Naudet's hand). In this movie, you'll get to know most firefighters - Tony Benatatos, the rookie (or 'probie' in New York firefighter), fireman Joseph Pfeiffer (who notes he later lost his brother), and a few others. Studio interviews are conducted with most of these people throughout the film to emphasize the personal, reflective nature of the events. The setup is quite dramatic and well done, especially the ceremonial ceremony in the fire department, with some useful swish-pans and a kind of dialectic editing of the rather limited film work (just like Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men.). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The angle of view and the camera angle usually come from the firefighters, which is interesting, and there are some excellent shots from the lobby of the WTC1, while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next. this is classic cinema. There is also the eerie, haunting sound of an occasional human body bouncing off the portico. Then an increasingly abandoned fire chief Pfeiffer realizes that his job is desperate and probably hopeless - and this before the collapse of WTC2. You must thank Naudet for knowing which faces to film at what time. <br /> <br /> The sound of the neighboring WTC2 is so terribly sad, poignant and terrifying that you realize what torture belongs to firefighters. It looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world in the lobby, and the poor firefighters look so confused and scared. You hear a tremendous, trembling whirlpool - like that of a huge monolithic animal slowly falling to the ground after a mortal wound - the neighboring tower has collapsed, but the fire team remaining in WTC1 is unaware of this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is captivating, but the narrative is amateurish and should have been avoided - keywords like "this was really a day like no other" or Naudet's often banal utterances like "you might see" scared in the Eyes of all and 'I knew that Tony freaked out! The movie is really just a long video diary. There are no pictures from above where some firefighters have gone. Imagine that this movie was mixed with CCTV footage from some of the overlying rooms or in the news of the day. The effect would be bigger. You could even combine that story with Mayor Giuliani's and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who literally had many floors and represented the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much propaganda element movie in it, as some critics suggest. This film is not a triumph of Riefenstahl's will. Some time later, firefighters drape the American flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some moments of dubious camera work; For example, who holds the camera when the two Naudet brothers are reunited in the fire station? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish that has been very well reflected in the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour) with two stripes of light reflected in the water.
