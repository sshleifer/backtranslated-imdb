This could be WWE's second-best PPV after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent game in which he angered Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy kept his IC title in a short, sloppy game with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a pretty tough match against Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good game with Kidman, which was surprising for me. Booker T defeated the Big Show in a no-dq match, and eventually Booker T gave the scissors the Big Show and sent it right through the table. In a stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the match of the evening, where there were big highlights, and the RVD could keep his ic title by a DQ. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little to nothing. At the Main Event, the Rock became the first 7-time WWE World Champion to defeat both Kurt Angle and Undertaker in a triple-threat game. All in all, this is probably the second best PPV of WWE in 2002! 10.7
