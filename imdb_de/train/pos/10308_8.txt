Was Morgan Freeman more unusual than God as George Burns? This movie was certainly better than this "Oh, God." I was totally penetrating and LMAO. Carrey was perfect for the unusual anchorman, and Aniston took her role as a frustrated friend in her usual well-played performance. For my part, I do not consider her ugly or infallible. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the filing cabinet and said he could never keep his life story. See if you can find the file in the closet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I rolled over it. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will be considered as one of the best of this Funnymans.
