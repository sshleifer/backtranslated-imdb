This movie is fantastic on so many levels ... and none of them is where it should be. Just remember: If you see Shaun of the Dead and others current zombie movies ... be good or bad ... THIS is the formula they use. That makes zombie movies so great. <br /> <br /> And what better way than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search gives you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not stay. There's never a point where you think to yourself, "Come on, keep going" ... it moves fast and makes beautiful turns. This is the sporty, small Italian number of zombie flicks. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a lot of time in your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> As a trifle Note: If you watch it on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects under the music score on the menu screen ... Well, that's because the music is coming directly from the trailer was raised ... which is probably the only working expression of this music that still exists long enough to grind.
