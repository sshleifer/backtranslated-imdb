Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better movie than its predecessor. The director knew what he needed to work with and addressed the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It's a funny movie that sounds technically better and was played. The performers do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is joking and walking with the river. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed and not as stiff in front of the camera as in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie and I highly recommend it. Like his first movie, he's geared for a specific audience (I seriously doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at the time). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
