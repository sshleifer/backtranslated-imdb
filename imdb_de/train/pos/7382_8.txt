My short comment to this film is: Go on, pick it up. The chances that you will be positively surprised by a variety of elements that are excellently researched in this criminal thriller. There is no way that the character of Miklos takes up space and pushes in any way, does not push his nerves to the edge ... 2 thumbs up!
