For Muslim women in West Africa, the married life of abusive husbands can be very hard. The Community may not explicitly endorse such behavior, but it may also not be ready to consider it criminal, an attitude that, of course, allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of Cameroonian law promises equality to all, and this documentary tracks the real achievements of various practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system as they seek to bring justice to a number of women and children. It is worth noting (apart from the uplifting central story) how the courts, in spite of their informality, are actually pragmatically progressive when a case is actually purchased. The program also provides a fascinating insight into the overall lifestyle of cameras, which appears (apart from the terrible crimes in the cases presented) astonishingly emotional and cheerful compared to the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And though I admit that this comment might betray my naivete, this attitude seems to be caught in the charming pidgin English they speak. All in all, this is a fantastic little movie and it's a lot more fun than you can imagine.
