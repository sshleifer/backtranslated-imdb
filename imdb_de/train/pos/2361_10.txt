I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and also work in acute medicine. Over the years, I've seen people dying from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, attending numerous conferences on bloodborne pathogens, and seeing several patients become seriously ill from transfused blood-borne pathogens. I've also heard that several Jehovah's Witnesses have been told they would die if they refuse blood, and after 26 years on the field I never really saw that it happened to benefit greatly from the battle on this issue? "The question for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral question." They need to be blood-tainted "is not an ambiguous statement. Thank you for this film and allowing comments.
