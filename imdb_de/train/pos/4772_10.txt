This movie is perhaps the most touching and uplifting I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. You suddenly realize that life really makes sense. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I heard about this film for the first time, I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded good and I was afraid that the story would be banal. However, as a David Lynch fan, I decided to give it a try. It took me about 30 minutes to get caught by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema and felt I had really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in a way it was very surprising that after exploring the movie he should make such a movie dark side of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight, because I also thought he did very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5 / 10
