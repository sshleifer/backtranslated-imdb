An interesting look at how we behave so often as humans is sometimes dazzled by our desire for perfection that sometimes we destroy the foundation of what we want to achieve. It also raises the question of how we tend to ignore those of us who are not so outspoken and thereby miss a great opportunity. The comedy makes watching the movie a pleasurable experience. A must for anyone who is looking for a thoughtful but funny look at life. I am looking forward to your next product. I hope you continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ...
