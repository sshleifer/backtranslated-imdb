I love ghost stories in general, but I LOVE Cool, atmospheric and elegantly scary ghost stories in the British style. This one qualifies in all points. A naive young lawyer (Britspeak lawyer) is sent to a small seaside village to settle the estate of an elderly, deceased woman. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons on vacation go to the beach for their health. Well, you know, there's nothing "healthy" in the village of Crythin Gifford, the creepy place where the older Victorian estate sits on the edge of a misty salt marsh. If the lawyer saves a little girl's life (none of the locals help the vulnerable man - you'll find out later why that's the case), he accidentally wakes the wrath of an evil spirit, the woman in black. It is not a filmy, gossamer spirit, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees them a few times, but you can feel their evil presence in every picture. As the camera sneaks onto the lawyer while reading legal papers, you expect the woman to appear black at all times. When the lawyer goes to the generator shed to turn on the power for the creepy old house, the camera attacks him, and you think she'll show up there, too. To wait for the appearance of the woman in black is exciting. We've already seen many elements of this story (the locked room nobody goes in, the fog, the na√Øve outsider who ignores the warnings of the locals), but the director somehow manages to turn them all into a completely new and compelling mind to combine history. Look at this with a buddy so you can keep warm while waiting for the woman in black. , ,
