A wonderful, free-flowing, often lyrical film that smiles at you and always smiles, even when there are really shocking incidents on the way. A gasp in the way the women are treated, and ultimately they seem to get along very well, and it's a merit that so many potentially catastrophic scenes all work so well. This is possibly the best performance of Depardieu, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau plays a prominent role in a possibly very difficult role, including violent sex scenes with a couple of guys who are at least half their age. Miou-Miou is very attractive and has again very difficult scenes to play. At first this seems to be a run-down and dirty misogynist, but as the story and characters unfold, a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end, this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.
