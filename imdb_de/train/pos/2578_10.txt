Superman and the Mole Men is probably the hardest adventure of Superman. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to the world's deepest oil well. There, some radioactive moles come through the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other citizens are trying to eliminate the invading moles. Can Superman change people's methods in time to save the moles? Can Superman warn people in time of the radioactive hazard the mole men bring with them? <br /> <br /> In my opinion Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-made film. Although we only see Superman fly once, it is still a great Superman adventure. A must for everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
