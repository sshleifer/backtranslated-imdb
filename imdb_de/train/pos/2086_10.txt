True to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent as a child in China as a child of missionary parents who gave her deep insights into Chinese culture and philosophy, this film adaptation is both technically and dramatically outstanding.> Wang Lung is a humble farmer who is grateful for the basics of life: to be to survive by his country and newly married to Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family in the village area. Despite the efforts of Wang Lung and Olan to cultivate the land, raise children and build savings and wealth threatens famine, eliminate everything that they have worked. Do not decide to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, and instead travel to a big city to await the famine. While they are in town, they are limited to begging and they are just one of hundreds of other unhappy homeless families. Although he is not a raider, Olan gets into a mob looting in a rich man's house. She was briefly detained for executing the army, but is rescued at the last minute. Her fortune, however, is that she found valuable gems at the plunder site, giving her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, selfish and acknowledges the discovery. He is a very rich farmer, but that only makes matters worse, as it is becoming increasingly unattractive, arrogant and difficult to understand. He loses contact with the basic things of life that money can not buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. As a punishment, nature once again turns against Wang Lung by sending a locust plague to destroy everything he has. Forced to the knees, Wang Lung asks all friends, former friends, workers and family for help. With all this help, he manages to save the farm. From this experience he returns again to humility and an appreciation for the foundations of life.
