Somehow, this movie simultaneously invigorates, bittersweet and heartwarming. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (of Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate ups and downs through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi Girl) with a speech impediment. As she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. Unlike most birds, however, he can say and understand everything. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawnbroker and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc. as she travels across the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with a few strokes of fate until Paulie ends up in a laboratory, where he is finally hidden in a cellar and found by a Russian custodian who is touched by the bird's story. The plot is in line with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I want to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful mix of flute, digital base and horns brings the film to the point of pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery make the story even more beautiful. And finally, the puppetry is absolutely believable. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies with the added comment that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet recently died. Overall, I give this movie **** of four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
