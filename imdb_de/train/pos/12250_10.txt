Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad that knights do not look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fantastic job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emma's dad. I love the final scene (which is a supplement to the novel - but well written) when the harvest comes in and feeds Knightly with his workers and high society friends. Emma has to show that she accepts that now. She is a changed woman. That's too much, but ok. I'm going to buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's ex-governess and confidante. She is wonderful. as I would have imagined. I think that if the United Kingdom makes Jane Austen, that's the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this!
