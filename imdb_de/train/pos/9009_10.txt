This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth ... in a delightful, carefree way. Not a serious but funny adventure. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We do not always get what we want, but we find that we get what we need to know, why we do not get what we wanted ... which causes us to get more than we thought ! You will receive this as soon as you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And in this movie, it's really about finding love and knowing you've found it and completely changed a person's life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites of all time .... ..not easy to find, but hunting is worth it ......... I guarantee you will see it more than once become!
