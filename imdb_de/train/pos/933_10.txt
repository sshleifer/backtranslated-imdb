I saw this movie in sixth grade around Christmas, and I was really excited to see it, and when I heard that George C. Scott was there, I was very excited because I really loved George C. Scott. When I and my class saw this movie, I was really interested in it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was totally awesome! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickens that I have seen so far! George C. Scott's performance as a Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he's the definitive Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is Patrick Stewart, but this is the better one! <br /> <br /> The great thing is the acting. I thought the actors were awesome, it was all there, the ghosts, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, all, they could not have come up with anything better than they had to do the parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the best! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they would have found someone who would be better! I do not think they could find someone who could better replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the final movie adaptation of the classic by Charles Dickens, and I really think you'll agree, you'll think this movie is fabulous! I'll probably have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought he was totally fabulous! I totally recommend you to see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
