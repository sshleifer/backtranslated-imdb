This is a movie that has many things that only Japanese can understand. Even if it's well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that someone tried to send a message, but it was wasted on me. <br /> <br /> What I basically thought was a mediocre movie with nice special effects. A child becomes "The One" and in the end has almost no relevance to a Yokai war that makes no sense anyway. It would be nice to understand what they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean that Yokai washes and the one that looks like a big umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart out!), I could not really see the plot. <br /> Conclusion: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terribly cute and the rest is crap.
