It's hardly the stuff dreams are made of is that quest for a brass ring from a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame con man mate (DUSTIN Hoffman) who will soon build a friendship based on basic survival skills A daring film for the time and an outstanding example of the edgy landscape explored in the more graphic films of the 1960s. Symbol of the "end of innocence" in American films, as it was the only X-rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male hustler who expects to come to the big city. Women find an easy way to make money when they fight for his body, but soon the city is a cold one Place without welcome mat for him. Befriended by a lame friend (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that make him disillusioned and bitter. He is ready to leave the confines of cold water for Florida's promised sunshine, a land his friend promises "Ratzo" dreams of living. <br /> <br /> But even with this last search, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has directed with a finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt, and John Barry's haunting theme "Midnight Cowboy" adds to the poignant moments of search and despair. Summary: A true American classic who is honestly facing a tough topic and daring to show the backgrounds of certain aspects of city life.
