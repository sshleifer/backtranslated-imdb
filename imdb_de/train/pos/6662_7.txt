Gandhi My Father is a well-made movie. It beautifully shows the life of Gandhiji's eldest son Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to be on his own, his failure, his ego. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. But not him, everyone was good in their roles. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on the screen I've ever seen. But I will score three points as there were some shortcomings. First, the movie was fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should have been. Second, the film needed more research on Harilal's character. Somewhere the character looked incomplete. His relationship with his brothers was not shown either. Throughout the movie, no other child was mentioned by Gandhiji. I think the character like Harilal should at least have some differences with his brothers, considering the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie.
