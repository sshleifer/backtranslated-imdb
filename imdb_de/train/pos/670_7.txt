THE LAST WAVE will never convince the mainstream audience. It's a slow but intriguing movie for those who are ready. An Australian lawyer is being called to hear the case of five indigenous people accused of murdering one of their defendants. All sorts of omens and omens soon emerge as the death of the man involves a tribal problem that was not intended for the white man's court, and the lawyer soon finds it difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy. It looks like the end of the world may be near, and he and the aborigines may know that, but no one else. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at his peak here. David Guptil, a well-known face from several Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five indigenous people to stand trial. The last wave is just not for everyone, as well as MAGNOLIA (both have weird things falling from the sky). Watch it on a slow Saturday night.
