With a relatively small budget for an animated film of just $ 60 million, the staff at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. Combining state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly-tuned vocal talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) create a highly entertaining family movie with a strong message of collaboration, friendship and caring for your herd members. And how many times it is necessary for many different creatures to form a herd. As I watch this movie, I get a strong political message about getting along with the people who share your space - maybe it should be seen for all world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - offers a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to advance the action and sometimes is positive to the toes. <br /> <br /> The overall picture of the film is incredible; an intensely colored, strangely credible fantasy land of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The characters were also incredibly believable, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's "Manfred" a special treat. The whole sequence with the DoDos leaves no doubt where the term "stupid" stands for. A DoDo comes from. '<br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps the things that may worry or frighten children pretty much disinfected - but still. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie you can see in the theater and buy at home.
