I really liked the first two seasons. because many good characters disappeared later. As with most shows, the shows are a bit slow at first, then they will be better in later seasons, but this is the absolute opposite. Season 1 Jenny and Season 2 Valarie were Sabrina's friends. I really did not care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends. I think for some reason the producers wanted us to dislike their college friends for some reason. They were so cruel to Sabrina. Season 1 favorite episode is the cat showdown, and my favorite Season 2 episode is Witch Trash, which is the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny that Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina and never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but always wanted to be with Harvey. I only wish they could have done better. I also liked how the first two seasons, during the opening credits, said a few words to Sabrina while wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode where she is in the witch costume. I liked how she said, "That's not me" and later I kept trying to turn into something else, but that's a really cool show. it's a bit like the andy griffith show in a sense, because it's good at first, but once it's turned colorful and barney fife has gone, it was longer good. but I still enjoy watching it, but the only reason I look at later seasons is because of Sabrina. What I meant by the opening sequence: The Opening Titles of Season 1 to Season 3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror, posing with different costumes and outfits, while the names of the performers at the bottom of the screen flash fast. In the end, Sabrina said a pun that referred to the outfit she is wearing and then disappear. The opening sequence of the fourth season includes the characters in bubbles. In the opening credits of seasons 5-7, Sabrina can be seen in various locations in Boston
