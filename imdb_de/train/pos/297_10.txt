I am glad that other people have enjoyed this movie because I know that he does not have the best reputation and has not made any money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the slightest touch, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple never looked better in the movie. You have seen worse movies!
