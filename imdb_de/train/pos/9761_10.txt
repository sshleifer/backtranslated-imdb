Here's a movie from my childhood that my family had recorded earlier; but over the years it has somehow been chopped off and lost. Now I was lucky to see the whole movie on youtube.com. I loved this wonderful movie when I saw it as a kid, and after watching it (online) again, I still do it today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I'll always remember this cute song). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening speeches (who animated who) that some animators came from the 1930s (WOW! that's 47 years).
