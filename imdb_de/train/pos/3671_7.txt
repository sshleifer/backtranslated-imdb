"Hollywood North" is a euphemism from the movie industry when they went to Canada for tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, has probably seen many attackers from California that this film seems the right way to cope with the incoming personalities trying to capitalize on the economy that Canada presented Needless to say, "Moon Lantern" is the successful novel of a Canadian author in "Flight to Bogota" converted, which has nothing to do with the original film. Michael Baytes, obsessed with what's going on in Iran, is a great selfish advocate who is offered the lead role that turns into a catastrophe. The movie seems to say that too many cooks have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case with the end product being rescued by its producer Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who has made a documentary of the film shot in Toronto, parts of the film are finally transformed into a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The shooting process is hilarious and the acting is generally good.
