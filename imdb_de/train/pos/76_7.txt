Vincent Price's follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that has cemented his reputation as a horror icon, is similarly a bitter one ?? if imaginative? Showman. Although it's a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the overriding effort. Aside from some unruly comic relief, the compulsory use of cheap gimmicks (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative flaws (what happened to the missing bag that was allegedly turned up at a police station with a severed head?) This provides more than enough Grand Guignol-type thrills and a general value for the camp (prize that is invented as the inventor of illusions embodied as "missing" star wizards who exploited his genius as the inventor of illusions) to stand alone for feet. Incidentally, the involvement of director Brahm proves no coincidence here. Since the narrative contains elements from two horror titles (both with Laird Cregar), he had previously directed, d. H. THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young leads are played by Mary Murphy (as an assistant to Price's Ing√©nue) and Patrick O'Neal (as a police officer friend). Strangely enough, even in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], he would have acquired the lead just in time to serve as an encore). An interesting side effect here is the assumption of a novel detection method, fingerprinting, which is crucial to the fall of Price (in a predictable, but rather unpleasant, fiery climax), though the persistent snooping of his hobby crime writer has at least as much in the long run as much to do with! Looking at the star in a tailor-made role, does the movie make a lot of fun? especially at a compact 73 minutes.
