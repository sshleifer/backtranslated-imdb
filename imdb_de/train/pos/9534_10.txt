Acting This film is a very well rehearsed movie. I will say that the performances are sometimes a bit weak; But the acting is usually very good. The only actor who blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks was a bit unsure in some parts of the movie, but he was incredible as well. Paul Newman, as good as ever. Cinematography This makes the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you wanted to pause the movie at any point in the movie, you will see the finely crafted work of this man. He sets each shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still at a standstill, the screen displays a postcard-like quality. When the camera moves, each shot is designed for unobtrusive perfection. But that does not stop it. Conrad's choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he illuminates the set is one of the most amazing lighting works I've ever seen. His work on this film made it what it is. This film is at the top of the list for the best camera with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. People will say this movie is a gangster movie from the 1930's, but I think they missed the movie's sense of purpose. It's a love story about a hit man who has not tried to protect his son from his chosen life. It is a brilliant story that develops into a beautiful connection between two people who have nothing but each other. Screenwriting deserves an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman performs a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is one of the most beautiful and moving scores I have in the herd. Director Sam Mendes is a new director with the feeling of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he receives from his actors are a rarity in today's film world. I will look for the next Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I have ever seen.
