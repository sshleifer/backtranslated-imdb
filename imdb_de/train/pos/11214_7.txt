This was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw in a $ 2 movie theater along the Hollywood Blvd. So I did not have any reference to the first installment that was done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked at McNairy County's corrupt system and the brutality of the Redneck Gangs. I was also amazed at the fact that a man decided he would not drop it and did something to do something about it. Courageous? I thought so - to a point where it was a shiver on my back. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story about the American courage to stand up and do something about a system that serves its own interests. I was pretty excited about it and I think that this is still one of the best films of the hero / anti-hero genre, which might make you laugh, but also includes current films like "The Punisher", but also because it true is history. The recent remake of "Rock" does not live up to the real fire in Buford Pusser's story. <br /> <br /> A "classic" I'm sure will reappear in the future.
