I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that I feel like you want something really bad that you've always dreamed of - you can have it. This shows a great desire fulfilling true happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can do things differently and be happy.
