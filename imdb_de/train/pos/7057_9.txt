As an adult, I really enjoyed these. I saw it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old chuckled at the mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what "Return to Neverland" has not achieved. A good follow-up to the Cinderella story; but what about Drusilla? Another sequel? Hopefully!
