This movie is incredible! While it's fun and entertaining, it's also deeply deep and opening. I will see it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but it's not what he believes to make him happy. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied and annoyed that his life is not what he wants it to be. As a result of this mentality, Bruce loses his job and blames God for everything he believes is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. After all, his life is exactly what he imagines to make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the one person who really loved him. As the film evolves, Bruce learns that the real change that had to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This movie was inspiring and deep. If you are really careful, it will force you to look at your life with a deeply humiliating respect for the fact that we are often much more blessed than we realize. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what's needed to make them happy?" and my humble addition: "Can not we lose ourselves and those who are important while we want to find out."
