This is a cartoon series in which most of the actions take place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, and so on. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you just have to see it for yourself: it will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it as a child in the 80s (with Swedish voices). I talked to some people who were kids in the 80's and they loved it too! I have to admit that the educational part of the episodes did not come through to me on a conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​raising children while having fun is wonderful. I have recently seen some episodes; There is a sense of humor and a heart that is hard to find in other children's programs these days. <br /> <br /> 5/5
