A memorable, intelligent and exciting film by one of the true geniuses of French film, the extremely capable Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to the murder of JFK and takes place in a non-writable, fictional country. The film is razor-sharp both visually and in terms of plot. Shot with meticulous precision, he follows Henry Volnay, the procurator, who picks up the coup. In many ways it is a very disturbing film, not least because of the cold and analytical precision of its commentary on the internal functions of a so-called modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are absolutely believable and Verneuil has left nothing to chance in his close conspiracy. On another level, this relatively little-known film was just fifteen years ahead of Oliver Stone, who was hailed for the "JFK" movie, an inferior film in many respects, of which credibility is not the least ... < br /> <br /> It is a masterpiece that every movie lover should see, preferably in its original French version with subs.
