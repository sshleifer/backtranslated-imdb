This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews, as noted elsewhere in IMDb), but he was a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people who were played by two of the best actors. The bystanders (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) were all clicked on the screen, making it a great viewing experience. The fact that he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all the pictures and posters in which he cycles to get around. And he was wearing socks in a scene ... According to reports, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb joke group.) Apart from the historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this was a great movie that you can watch with a great cast. I give an 8!
