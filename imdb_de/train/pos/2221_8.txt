One night I stumbled over the satellite station Bravo. Originally out of curiosity, I decided to look at it. To be completely honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body is well represented. He would have been wasted as an executioner, but apparently not after seeing the full movie! My only real criticism is the acting of the actors, especially the actor who plays Melnik. His madness! Get drunk and try passports with his co-guard Wanda, though fortunately for us viewers and for Hank he ends up getting dirty with Wanda. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions. This movie looks good, just for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
