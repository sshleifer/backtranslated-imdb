Fay, the sister of the infamous Nobel Prize-winning smut poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Her son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an unknown sender, followed by a chase across three continents, involving an extremely sad collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops. > Parker Posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance with brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves in the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good score from Hartley (and thanks in the credits at the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a fellow in the fall of 2004).
