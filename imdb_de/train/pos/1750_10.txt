Well, let me just say something to these actors, they were really a good decision, and from experience actors really bring the dialogue to life. If you're fifteen minutes late, you'll be in for a shock, the movie has already begun. You do not want to miss the first jokes, provided you have come to no jokes. <br /> <br /> Wow! I've never seen a movie that ended with such a definitive ending. Not to be tough, I mean, I loved it, but it just surprised me that it really went on until it stopped! But I stand in front of me, I start with the beginning, when it started. The plot sketch goes like this, there is this man, and no spoilers to give away (* spoiler alert !! *) (he has never had sex (!), You use this plotter to set the story going, and there are ( intentionally or not, it could go both ways) some funny situations of the main characters, some with irony, jokes and unpleasant situations, you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses the advances in technology through combination of the film, which was shot on set, and a script dialogue, some music and jokes to make a comic film that was conceived as comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with a full movie Film and expecting to see a weird comedy, which I already knew, and felt as if I had just left a theater that was playing a funny comedy TEN STARS !!!
