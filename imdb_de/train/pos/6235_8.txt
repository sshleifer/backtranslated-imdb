This is one of the best Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers movies or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R films offer great danceable but juicy love stories. This still has the courtship, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This film not only offers great dancing but also sympathetic characters and a lot of good songs. Music is the central theme and what's nice is adding a Rogers tap solo. She was not only a great dancer, but also a very pretty woman with a huge figure. Of course she also dances with Fred and they are always a fun couple that you can see on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> When he grew up in the fifties and saw "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was really kick the first time I saw that to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No wonder Ozzie fell in love with this beauty. Although she had this short hairstyle of the early 30's, I immediately recognized her voice. Also in this movie there are fast appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have not seen Ball yet. I can not find her, but I know she is here. <br/> <br/> Astaire, aside from some offending chewing gum in the first third of the movie, was funny to see and Randolph Scott - though better in westerns - is also sympathetic. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie to feel good and a good movie if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
