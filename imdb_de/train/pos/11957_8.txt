Great Woody Allen? No, Woody Allen? Certainly. I found myself laughing with the audience, often laughing at some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard in a long time. The aging Allen created an appropriate role as Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... well, somehow. Some have said Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton". I beg to differ. She plays Woody's dialogue, which always feels very similar in his comedies ... like a Woody Allen comedy. That's good for us, Woody. She certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of his latest comedy Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor boring, but for those who love it, if done right, we look forward to the next one.
