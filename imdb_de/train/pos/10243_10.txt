It's great, I loved it because I love dinosaurs, they are the greatest animals, but I loved the show because it was not copied from another show and it was an original with a good plot and great for little kids (If they like dinosaurs That means) I also have a few drawbacks, it's not too big because the dinosaurs look a bit mutated, so I should have only had a 7, but now it's a little too late for the next 4 Rows, it's great for a fantasy show though warning that this could spoil a part for you. So if you do not want it spoiled, do not read on plz at the end. It's kind of strange, because all you have to do is get Dang. I forgot what it was like I think it's not a spoiler, so anyway, I loved it and it's my opinion and I'm sorry for all the missing spelled words
