Spoiler Following: I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it came out and did not know anything about the case. To pause the press and the Australian people here, I was quite far off before I began questioning Chamberlain's guilt. The author obviously intended to help the reader understand why the public came to the conclusions that they were doing. John Bryson told the story when she was presented to the jury (and picked up by the press) of the Arteria Noi, the Actelone (??) plates. James Cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, a baby could not quite be pulled out of their clothes, the buttons still on, bloody handprint, etc. all pretty convincing. After all, these were experts in their field who made lies without any apparent reason, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong was not clear to me at all. It was also very technical evidence that was difficult for a layman to understand. Hardly anyone had heard of hearsay in the lawsuits by that point, about a dingo who had attacked a human being; People did not believe that it was possible. The public was suspicious of Seventh-day Adventists, whose origins made them a cult, and all sorts of savage beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Unless dedicated, selfless attorneys worked tirelessly to investigate and resist the trials, Azaria's dress would not have been enough to free Lindy from prison. That's why the book shook me, and since then I've been reluctant (except OJ of course) to come to a conclusion about someone's guilt. I was thrilled that a film about the case would be filmed, and I do not think he could have done better. I always liked Sam, with whom I could fully identify, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it's not just a very good movie, but also a very important one. Too bad that it was no longer advertising at the time of publication.
