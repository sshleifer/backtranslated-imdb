This movie was a pretty entertaining comedy about Murphy's law applied to home ownership and construction. If a movie like this were shot today, the family would undoubtedly be dysfunctional. As it plays in the "simpler" forties, we get a typical family of that era. Of course, Grant perfectly combines the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent minority, highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans provide solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
