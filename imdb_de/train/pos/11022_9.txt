FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> Action movies in which the superhero has to accomplish an infinite series of incredible accomplishments should not be judged credible, but will recover at lightning speed and turn harmless devices into deadly weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin is directing. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has many advantages: breathtaking landscapes that are wonderfully photographed, breathtaking special and visual effects (the first five minutes are captivating and re-create the sound of the film), excellent music notes, welcome attempts at easiness to relieve tension , and a solid cast: Two heroes (Stallone, Star and Cowriter, has the lion's share of footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker can not stand), a charming heroin (Janine Turner) and one of the craziest villains of all time (priceless John Lithgow and the deceptively feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual range and who makes the best of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good solid entertainment then, if not credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote (like another movie) "It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy, as long as you do not make the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
