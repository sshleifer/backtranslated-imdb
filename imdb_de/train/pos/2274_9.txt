Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and did not know them. The only reason I saw it was Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the movie has pleasantly surprised me. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focused on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries to the Americans with hidden secret messages, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. What weight has more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more pronounced, as these words are never spoken, not even as narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with excellent acting and photography, this film succeeds. <br /> <br /> There are other issues, such as the humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (such as the song White Christmas) that make it very different from average American films. I recommend it to anyone who is bored in Hollywood spy films.
