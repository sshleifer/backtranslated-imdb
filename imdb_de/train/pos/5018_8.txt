If you are like me you will love this awesome coming of age teen movie. I think it's up there with mischief, love book / high school USA / screaming / calendar girl / crybaby / all the big movies in the 50's early 60's and it has a wonderful soundtrack. Not as many songs as in some of these types of movies, but still great. It is sometimes very funny and has a big love interest. All young people are great There were more types of these wonderful movies. My favorite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty Mcfly returned to 1955. In these wonderful movies he stays in the fabulous 50s (early 60s) but not many.
