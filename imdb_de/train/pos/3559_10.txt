I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. <br /> <br /> It's true that Frank Sinatra does not have the chance to sing so much in this movie, but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie he mainly sings. <br /> <br /> I actually thought it would be better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he has the right voice and I could not see anyone with that great voice that triggered the gangster feeling in his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kayes "Sit Down, You Rock the Boat" is a captivating, singing song I just love. It's a hard act to follow with his version, and I still like his best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons would be perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have considered them first, but seeing them in the role made sense. Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. In a re-staging in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I find that often something is lost from the stage version to the movie version, but this has kept the feel of the stage even though it was in the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well filled. I've played in regional versions of it and it's one of my favorites from that time.
