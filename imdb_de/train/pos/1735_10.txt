Miss DeCarlo's debut in the title role has everything the writers could get underway - from the Franco-German War to the US Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, variety, stage band, and one Chinese garbage Just when you thought the plot could not be screwed anymore, it does. It's great, in the cheek. DeCarlo's character (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, that's the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious Lola Montez, who was the lover of the King of Prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. She fled to the American West. Arizona has a city called Salome, Where She Danced, based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleves and the Russian nobleman who falls under their charms are historically unclear, and I do not suppose the Chinese man is Scottish-accented - but he's one of my favorite classics in all-time camp and DeCarlo is through and breathtakingly beautiful.
