I have to admit, this movie moved me so much that I burst into tears. However, I always think twice about that, and instead of writing a laudation that would define the film as flawless and flawless, I'd rather risk taking a closer look. <br /> <br /> First of all, what comes first: The movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer just because it starts and continues as a slow movie that does not try to familiarize you with the actual scenes from September 11th astound. Fortunately for this stroke of genius, unlike Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER, this movie fortunately does not focus on the attack itself, but on the fallout, which, like the fallout of an atomic explosion, is barely visible yet dangerous and devastating. The psychological repercussions, the terrible devastation caused by September 11, and the devastation wrought by the American people are almost palpable in this film. I think Binder made a smart look at American society after 9/11 and, in my view, turned Sandler from an average comedy actor into a real talent for an Oscar-worthy performance. <br /> <br /> In the movie BLOOD DIAMOND says the character of Di Caprio and I quote: "Ah, these Americans, I always want to respond to their feelings." Now I do not want to reduce her suffering, but I would like to make a comparison. Since September 11th, the entire world has been confronted with souvenirs, memorials and commemoration of 9/11. The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer play more than just September 11 in their works. Well, this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 9/11 make the death of 3,000 people the biggest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on this subject, and the number of films shot on the subject, and I respectfully say that, make the meaning of this atrocious crime somewhat incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The fact is, people die every day from unjust acts and terrible crimes committed by bad or lost people. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. Every day we forget the poverty that afflicts the African people, and we tend to be less inclined to empathize with the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives do not matter much with our Western lives , Africa has neither the money nor the potential to commemorate its national tragedies in a way that America can. So I say this: the reason why we feel more about the 3,000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Without a newspaper article, a film or a book that covers 9/11, not a day goes by. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I was happy with Charlie Fineman, but I was not sure if I had the right to do it Feeling more for him than for a Hutu who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war , <br /> <br /> Do you catch my thrift?
