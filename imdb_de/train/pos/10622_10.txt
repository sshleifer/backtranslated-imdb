"Hate of a Minute" is a breathtakingly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that will take you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a "must" for any film student or horror fan. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric separate this movie from other psycho killers. Some exclamations to the producer of the film, Bruce Campbell, as well as the movie "The Evil Dead" bring humor to anyone who knows the genre.
