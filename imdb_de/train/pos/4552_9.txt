Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances of an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker playing his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is great, as the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as a dad. Worth seeing for the outstanding achievements.
