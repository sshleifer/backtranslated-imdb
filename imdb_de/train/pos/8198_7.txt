Dirty Harry has to find a rape victim who takes revenge by shooting the assailants in the thugs before he kills them. It would probably be a more appropriate punishment to keep her alive after the first shot and to let her suffer forever as she and her sister did. The main rapist played by Andy Drake is appropriately disgusting and will eventually (of course!) Be punished. Not a classic movie, but better than the others, except the original Dirty Harry.
