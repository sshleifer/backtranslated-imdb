This is the first movie by Tom Hanks I saw in the theater, though he's my favorite. When I heard that he was playing a hit man, I thought a bit, "Can Mr. Hanks get this off?" And he did it the high way. This 1930s Depression movie is all about loyalty, salvation, and a way in which you do not want your kids to stumble. Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan. The father of the family and the secret life of Oscar's contract killer nominated Paul Newman. In this film, Tom Hanks focuses more on reaction and eye than dialogue, he delivers a knockout performance. One night of one of his jobs, Michael's son Michael Jr. played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, witness of the hit. And Michael Sr., his crime partner, Daniel Craig can not publish this information. So he makes out the son and wife of Michael Senior, except for Michael Jr. So they go to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Paul Newman's Mr. Rooney). The drama and the intense conspiracy It really thickens as the father tries to get things right, even though the son goes on the journey. On this deadly journey, someone hired a hit for Michael Sr. The assassin would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a spotty Jew Law. The movie will make you feel the old days. And with Thomas Newman's beautiful and haunting Oscar nomination, you can not miss this film by Oscar winning director Sam Mendes. Sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
