Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed up early as a painter. Artemisia was taught by her father and was born at a time when talented women were denied the right to have their jobs created alongside men by men. Her tragic life is recorded in this biography film directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> After reading the novel "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, we took a closer look at the life of this woman, her work and her heritage. We also read Mary Garrard's Artemisia Gentileschi, a must-have book for all art lovers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents the fictionalized facts that we have read about the young woman's early life she is starting to paint. She was clearly influenced by her father's work, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of the time. Her relationship and love relationship with Tassi is the foundation of the film. Unfortunately Artemisia could not go as far as she could because of the prejudices against women in the arts. It did not help that she caused a scandal in which she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to travel to Rome to distance herself from this unfortunate time of her life. Valentina Cervi makes a beautiful Artemisia. She is a beautiful creature that aroused the passion of men. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia but ended up in jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a shiny finish that captures the camera work of Benoit Delhomme in all its glory. The scenic locations of the film give an idea of ​​what inspired this painting school to create its canvases. The music of Krishna Levy serves what we see. Agnes Merlik set her own visual style with a sure hand.
