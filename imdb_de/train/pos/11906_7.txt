This documentary about Locksmith William Castle makes some cheap shots in the naïve environment of the fifties / sixties, where he did his most characteristic work - look at the funny, stupid people wearing the ghost goggles - but she is also affectionate and lively a particularly clever comment by John Waters, who was absolutely the target group for such things at the time, and by Castle's daughter, who adored her father and is also very attentive to how he practiced his craft. (We never know what happened to the other Castle kid.) The movies were not very good, that's clear, but his marketing was brilliant, and he seems to have been a gracious, hard-working family man. People like "Straight Jacket", Diane Baker, who looks great, and Anne Helm, who replaced her at the instigation of Star Joan Crawford, keep popping up. Darryl Hickman explodes with giggles at the happy memory of working with Castle on The Tingler, and there is enough material to give us an idea of ​​Castle's talent - not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when the audience was rather satisfied, and it makes you nostalgic for simpler movie days.
