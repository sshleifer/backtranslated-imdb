This is a great movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I never thought the movie was so exciting and funny! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (The Secret of the Old Clock) so you can get used to Nancy. Then you can watch the movie because in the movie they do not really introduce the characters. Name fast. ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting. This is an ultimate comeback from previous Nancy Drew films that the Nancy Drew actor did not seem to like. This movie is similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. That is so cool! Nancy Drew Lover, you have to see that!
