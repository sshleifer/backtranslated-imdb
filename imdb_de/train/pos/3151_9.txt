I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was damn funny! When I first saw that it was playing on ETV (Estonian Television), I started to like it. Too bad that this show is bad for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes up with stupid ideas. He got these glasses, which is brown. I like this . And there is FeZ. The group Pervers. We all know what he does when he is alone ... He wants to lie badly. He even had it with his boss in one episode. He is from India. And there's Michael, the stupidest guy in the group, probably the dumbest guy in town and his cop! He's so stupid that I remember: Hyde says: Did you call cops? - No, Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is a playboy from the city. Then comes Jackie, Michael's former girlfriend, and then she's Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric is the son of a grumpy war veteran and the housewife Kitty. His a big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend, with whom they plan their marriage. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm, what am I forgetting? ah Hyde lives in a cellar.
