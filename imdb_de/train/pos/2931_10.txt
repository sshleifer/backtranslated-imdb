No doubt, Eddie Murphy Delirious is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw it for the first time about two years ago, I was in Stichen a few weeks later. I have seen it 17 times to this day and I still laugh my ass off. For those who do not know that Eddie Murphy was a brilliant stand-up comedian before becoming a Hollywood superstar. There is not a single boring point in this piece of genius, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987 and goes flat in the middle. If you are not the kind of person who can not stand the cursing, I would not advise you to see it, as you will probably hear a form swear every 5-10 seconds. I rated this with 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comic genius of all to his best.
