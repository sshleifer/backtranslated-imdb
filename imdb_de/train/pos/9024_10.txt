Five years later, after the Tenko survivors returned home, and Marion's double-edged "Well, that's it." <br /> <br /> It is now 1950: reunification time. The gang is all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and the offspring Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is beautiful: as perfectly written and handled as thought-provoking and moving like the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions remaining at the end of the series will be answered properly here. From Marion's family to the Joss health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best. <br /> <br /> A trip to the plantation of Dominica brings with it many shocks and some real benefits. Seat tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster as fate regains power and women fight for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colors, and there are a few dramatic moments when the urge is screwed through the television. <br /> <br /> Lush filming in Singapore and opportunity to meet a group of women who want to become friends. It's a shame that this is really the end. I could see it again. Perfection.
