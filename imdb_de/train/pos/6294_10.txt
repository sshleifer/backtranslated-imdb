This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic drama and visual pain, a homage to Buster Keaton's early films. Lots of slapstick: Buster falls onto a bulkhead door, falls into a puddle and runs around his pants. The invention of a time helmet by the stupid scientist reminiscent of a Flash Gordon concept of the future. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for women's hats or 17 cents a pound for beef, make Buster seem incredibly high. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking, if he is mistakenly transferred to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster tried to go backwards! The "scientist" of the time wants to return to a calmer world, which he studied and admired in 1890. They go back together, and Buster / Mulligan is happy now, and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic devices, modern beds, or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone has no heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, this is one of his last efforts. That's enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing - the long-term underutilized Maytag man Jesse White is a mechanic who repairs Time Helmet and anticipates his laundering career.
