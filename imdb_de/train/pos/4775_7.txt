If you want action and adventure in a movie, you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go with that mood, watch The Straight Story. Richard Farnsworth shows a compelling performance as a gentle and elegant gentleman Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower through three states to see his alienated brother, who has suffered a stroke, winding roads, making friendships with strangers and many grandfathers Give advice on family on the way. The story moves as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to continue watching the audience and waiting for the next hour Alvin will offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, rated 7/10 in my book.
