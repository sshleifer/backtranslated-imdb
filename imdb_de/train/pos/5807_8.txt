This is a very good movie in my opinion, especially for lovers of Michael Jackson. It contains a message on drugs, stunning special effects and a fantastic music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie focuses on the song and the music video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four-minute music video, it's normal and, in my view, a lot easier to see. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty weird though. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" who turns into a machine when he sees a shooting star. Throughout the film, he transforms into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> Especially the robot scene is a bit boring and strange. Compared to the rest of the movie, I found it a bit confused. <br /> <br /> A child is abducted, Michael tries to rescue her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But aside from the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie, and every Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
