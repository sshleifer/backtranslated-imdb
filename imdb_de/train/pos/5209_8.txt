I saw this important intense movie today. It's Richard Gere and Claire's Dane, the most important and the best work. Gere earns an Oscar for his beautiful portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator. Claire Danes is thrilled when the woman who replaces Gere with her hand to replace him - a woman he tries to teach while investigating a recent case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of those who he is to supervise, holding a young girl hostage. The theme is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie is not forgotten so quickly. I know I'm being followed by Gere's account for a long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of a serial killer has scared a screen image and got me so engaged. The movie starts with a shocking statistic. So do not miss the opening credits. Intense and unforgettable. Richard Gere's finest role proving that the man can act. Danes can do too and both are extremely good at this often-challenging movie. <br /> <br /> This is a brave movie and Gere offers a multi-layered, heartfelt performance. Just give him the Oscar ... he deserves it!
