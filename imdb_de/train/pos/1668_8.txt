Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I would like that, but since I did not feel like sleeping and nothing else, I kept watching and was fascinated by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi evoked recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume drama. Great game, great camera shots, great music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)
