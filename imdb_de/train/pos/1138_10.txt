When I was 8 years old, I always saw movies and TV that I was not supposed to, and this was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies ever, and it must be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is excellent. They do not make comedies like these anymore (movies that are really funny and make you laugh without giving up on excrement or some kind of vomit, like in these delayed Judd Apatow films with listless non-actors like Seth Rogen, Barf) This movie is a classic with actors who really can act and deserve all awards.
