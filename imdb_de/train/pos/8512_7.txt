I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but I'm terrified that anyone actually paid to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did this year. The thing is that they probably revised it. Especially the scene in which my roommate snuffed Coke from the tits of a Mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him). We've made a few comings and goings, but I can not remember anything. I was in a few scenes of the MC (from what I was told.) What I can say is that everyone shunned the camera crew, because who wants to remember the guy who threw or the girl who threw his Tits of the world showed (or the girl whose loser has lost his virginity.) Overall, the trip was crazy, but people behave differently when the camera is focused on them.
