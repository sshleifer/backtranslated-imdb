I have seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among these, my favorite movie is this movie (which may not be the best - but a favorite, yes). When I checked IMDb, I realized that I immediately laughed into myself because the movie was so cute and sweet and well done. Marion Davies proved with this film that she really had a great talent and was not just William Randolph Hearst's lover. <br /> <br /> The story features a hick from Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation that he would immediately be a star! Their experiences and the interesting cameos of the stars of this era make this a real treat for movie fans and a must!
