Do you like a really imaginative comedy or do you love "the wedding crashers"? I can not believe that this movie is not rated higher. Basically Meadows plays a character that is not different from Austin Powers. There are so many imaginative moments in this gagorama. Out of cruelty - Leon played with himself on the porch, the ex-boyfriend trotted to dinner. , Well. To crazy clown sex, to Broadway routine, to the voice-over. Meadows is great as the childlike but very good-natured Leon. Some great lines "do not blame the Wang," "freaky deaky sex world" too many. , , Why this film was not so big is a mystery. Great comedy.
