I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris is pleasingly superior. The lighting and shooting angles in some scenes of Harris make his face look really evil. The surprising twist in the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but a pleasing one. I gave it 7 out of 10.
