This James Bond game is the best Bond game I've ever played in my life. It's my favorite James Bond game so far, because: The missions in this game are really fun, they can be really hard, which makes it more fun to play. The missions have many actions, the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are fantastic, the car missions have a lot of action and are really fun. The speakers are really good and it's cool that Sean Connery plays the voice for James Bond. The way Bond looks, it's really cool, because it looks like Sean Connery, when he played James Bond in the movies, and the other character looks pretty much the same as the movie's look. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Also, the game follows the movie quite a bit, but not all, but most of the time it makes it cool. <br /> <br /> Total score *********** from ***** *****
