Emma is a horribly flawed film based on the classic novel by Jane Austen. I did not read the book, so I really did not know so much about the plot, and yet I predicted almost the entire storyline. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing process. The movie is entertaining for some reason and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I did not like, but the majority was well played and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow does one of her best as a heroine in Emma. The movie also plays Toni Collette (Who's alright, but was a lot better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who was better, but he's still very good here) Alan Cumming (I'm never really impressed and pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam (at first glance his performance is rather woody, but rather subtle, though that was not what she needed) Jane Austen's books were adapted much better, but this book is still entertaining and worth watching.
