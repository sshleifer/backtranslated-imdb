I think the first 20 minutes of this movie might be one of the most exciting movies. The brilliant music score is working to bring the suspense to a shattering climax. What moviegoers in the 30s have made it, I can only imagine. The Times said then: 'A miracle has come to the screen.' Look at it and be amazed.
