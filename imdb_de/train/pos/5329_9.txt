This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were conceivable. <br /> <br /> But, assuming you can make enough light to laugh It was a thoroughly exciting move that combined Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were stupid rather than bad. The good guys were not so good. The black actors played more normal characters than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> A baby's admission added a good touch. Sympathy would otherwise have been a bit difficult. <br /> <br /> I do not have to agree to the show. On the whole, it was very good. I really wanted to beat Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And is not that the mark of a really good movie that wants to beat Judge Reinhold?
