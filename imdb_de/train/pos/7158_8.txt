Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> If Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongfully convicted of theft, he will be sent to Camp Green Lake. In this camp, the overseer and her two retainers, Mr. and Pendanski, order the fellow traveler to dig holes for holes at Loch. But for what reason? Stanley wants to find out. <br /> <br /> I never really had any intention of seeing "holes", and I have to admit, I only really saw the movie because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf. Even if you're not a fan of it are, it does not matter. "Holes" is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and includes a wonderful idea to take a flashback into the past. These do not distract and really convey a great background story. All actors are great. The young stars are working well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a pleasure. Shia LaBeouf shows that he can act error-free even with 17 years. This is a Disney movie you would definitely enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I'm learning from failure." Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
