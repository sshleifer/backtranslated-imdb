My review refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG-1, which make wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! From the fifth season, the show focused on a different focus - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and an alien) who regularly go into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate", in which the device is discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to see) and very creative. Many of the imaginative stories could easily have been turned into great sci-fi movies. What happens next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show rests are also clearly defined and brilliantly executed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue is marked by incredible wit and humor. It's just fun to look at them. <br /> <br /> Starting in the fifth season, the series evolved into an ongoing storyline based on the fight against a single opponent (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The actions become more complex (much more political / strategic) and are interdependent. The characters were still as great as ever, but the show was different by nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be mentioned is to watch the episodes that are reminiscent of the 100th and 200th epochs. They are just not overlooked shows. They show the creative and wildly humorous genius that has carried the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, check out a few episodes from the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be amazed. If you like to develop storylines between two opposing sides, you have ten staggering times to look forward to.
