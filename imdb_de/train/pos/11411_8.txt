Van Dine must have been a smart businessman when dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series from the study days were usually limited to one or two studios. Apparently, however, Van Dine must have sold each book individually about Philo Vance. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and more have all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to be more in Hollywood. MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and played with Edmund Lowe the fashionable detective. Of course, MGM had the original Philo of the screen under contract at that time, but Bill Powell was busy with The Thin Man at the time, and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there, a fairly acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had begun quite big with What Price Glory at the end of the silent time and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen and their flag and quirt characters. After McLaglen received his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe appeared to fade in the B-picture market. <br /> <br /> The garden murder case involves three different victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The eerie atmosphere around the offender somehow betrays it, the secret is really how all the killings are connected and how they are executed. <br /> <br /> But I will say so. Vance has a very good chance of exposing the villain, and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock's.
