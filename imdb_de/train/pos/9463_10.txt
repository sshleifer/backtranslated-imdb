I loved "Dan in Real Life". A wonderful love story like You Have Got Mail or While You Sleeped, but not ridiculously full of blurred vision and rude jokes, and not so romantic that you have to vomit. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advocacy columnist who apparently can not fix things in his own life. Until one day, on a family reunion / journey, he meets Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a beaming copy of a woman who seems to be framed by a hazy filter that is one of the starlets of classic cinema. Chemistry happens with a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie has to go to an earlier engagement and they have to part. <br /> <br /> Later, we are treated to Dan's close-knit, fun-loving relatives, who not only enjoy a great breakfast together, but also use the intelligent and loveable Dorky Dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes. What I liked so much was that although some of the characteristics of the family could be considered unpleasant for some, I thought it would be a great portrayal of a large family that does not dare parody or gross exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are really interested in Dan best. There are wonderfully uncomfortable family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is curious but never mean or gossipy; quirky, but never alien. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he brought to the family reunion. And so begins a roller coaster ride of restrained longing and funny love buds. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just thought that this movie is just great. It's not terribly "hip" or "clever", never too verbose and obsessed with dry humor or biting jokes, as there are many comedies in modern cinema. There is a nice balance between storytelling visuals and witty-but-real dialogue. In fact, the first spark of love at the beginning of the film begins with a bizarre discussion in a classic Hollywood conversation in which the characters say what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> So I probably played around and repeated myself, but I recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me will you be a little bit teary-eyed. Full of fun and magical love, Dan in Real Life does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ============================== Rating: A
