This is a very entertaining movie. Some of the reviews I read in this forum were written by people who seem to think the movie was a serious drama. It was not done that way ... It's an extremely entertaining movie played in a tongue-like way. All actors are obviously having fun while they talk to us. The combat sequences are lively, lively and above all not unfounded. The so-called "Green Death" used on some occasions is not, as I read in a review, "cruel". A few critics were very critical of the fight between Doc and Seas towards the end of the film. Hey, brighter, again ... I remember once again that this is a funny movie. Each phase of this "fight" was labeled, which contributed to the fun aspect. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the ultimate fate of the "Bad Guy" (Seas) is treated. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and just treat it for entertainment, you will spend 100 minutes in a pleasant way.
