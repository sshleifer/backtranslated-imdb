"Written in the wind" was an enormously successful universal image. Only Douglas Sirk could do that, a man who saw the possibilities in the material given to him. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, he had all the elements that make up an outstanding melodrama: nymphomania, great oil wealth, alcoholism, incest, and a touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk paved the way for what was later to follow in the genre of soap operas, mainly "Dallas" and "Dynasty," to name just two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the movie was completely turned inside a studio. The decor is mostly wrong. Like many of these pictures from the 50s, "Written on the Wind" was filmed exclusively on a studio lot. Just look at the scenes taking place in Manhattan, Miami or even at the lake, you can see the scenery as a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk was no less concerned with realism as long as he could tell the story in his own way. <br /> <br /> Recently, we did a film screening, part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people laughed in some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes in which Rock Hudson, the good Mitch Wayne plays, appears. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later caresses his own daughter, the wicked Marylee, the oil derrick decorating the older man's desk, a kind of phallic art object , <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his performers to do the best they could, in the way Dorothy Malone portrays nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a degree Robert Stack, who plays Kyle as the role 'Sense makes tortured heirs of history. That would probably be the simple explanation of what's on the screen. The only one who seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to be anything but a grounded person hanging around with the wrong crowd of Lucy Moore characters. <br /> <br /> Along with his other Hollywood In films, "Written on the Wind" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public exactly what they wanted to see: stories that are bigger than life, the only seen on the big screen
