An uncompromising view of a suburb in the Viennese century of the 21st century, which mixes the stories of six groups of people by former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl, is a provocative, minimalist and intense observation cinema. After the worldwide spread Hundstage brings the modern voyeurism to a disturbing, deep level in the Big Brother reality shows. A piece of European art cinema that is hard to estimate but not to be underestimated may seem cruel and grubby, but manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a commendable manner.
