With the current trend of gross out humor, this movie is the forefather of all. While some of the humor is outdated, any sketch will either shock, repel, or make you laugh. Most memorable is the sexplay commentary and of course the VD-spot. It does not always work, but it's worth it if it works. I give this a 7.
