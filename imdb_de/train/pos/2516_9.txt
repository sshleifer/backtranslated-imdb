Based on the idea of ​​Gackt, Moon Child took place in a poverty-stricken country called Mallepa. In a futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives of the two main characters Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their grown up friends. <br /> <br /> Despite some actions, some actions may be excessive or maybe humorous I firmly believe that this is a movie about friendship. Even with all the hardships between characters, each of them wanted someone on their side to make friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei portrayed a vampire who hated the idea of ​​killing to live. A vampire found friendship in the hands of a little boy, Sho, who is not afraid of kei. Regardless of what some have thought, I see Kei as a paternal figure for Sho. Kei was there during Sho's earlier life, taking care of him and teaching him to live in a world where the power between the gangs controls their lives. On the other hand, Sho, who may perhaps be considered an innocent, enthusiastic young man, became a man who realized that life is not just fun and games, that death exists and that he can take his loved ones away < br /> <br /> I love the part where Lee Hom, the actor who played Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they met was really cool. Son also has a big role in this film, the fact that he comes from another race, a Taiwanese, has greatly influenced the friendship theme within the film. The way in which friendships were developed despite background differences was excellently portrayed in this film. <br /> <br /> I believed that every actor did a great job, considering that this was the first time he appeared in such a movie. Both HYDE and Gackt have managed to do pretty well and have created quite credible characters. Unlike movies where musicians became actors and filled the film with songs, they did great acting work! Moon Child has really impressed me, it has given new meaning and friendships to friendships that we must cherish every friendship in our lives. Despite all the bad things happening in her life, the film shows a lot of hope that there is always hope. Life can be cruel, it seems that there is no hope anymore. It also shows a very strong sense of friendships among each other, even if son became the enemy, Sho had a kind of "fun" in his last battle. Everyone wanted peace in the end, no matter how far apart he was. The final scene showed us.
