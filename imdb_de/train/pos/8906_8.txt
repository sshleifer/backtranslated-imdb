Some who watch and complain about movies forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you the people. I saw the main screen in this screen repeat about 35 times. It was fantastic. A cinematic tapestry with cascading brilliance that had me from then on, which was the beginning. Often the sum and Bam! I was addicted. Again and again and again. And over. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I am left lying in bed with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and tonight is soft again soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle crossing me is already rested. I popped into the DVD. I was fascinated. Through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> The blob. See Steve Queen, two policemen and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
