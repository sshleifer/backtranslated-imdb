Time for Hollywood to sit up and stand out! If the actors behave dazed, you only need the animators who worked on this little miracle. Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you do not see people. Although the voice-overs of casts (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are among the best I've ever heard, the emotions of the "cartoons" are irritating. <br /> <br /> This style animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadow makes the movie a vivid painting. Ironically, such technical wizardry lets forget that this is actually a very beautiful movie. The pace and the development of the plot are wonderful and the dialogues are crisp. Plot: The disappearance of the top employee of a mega-corporation reveals a story of fraud and corruption with a cold-hearted hero at the wheel. I can not say much without giving everything away ... except while the movie keeps you at the edge of the seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must for ... adults who are grinning about "cartoons"
