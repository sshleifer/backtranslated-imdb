This movie stands head over heels in the vast majority of romantic movie comedies. It is practically flawless! The writing, the acting, the production design, the humor and the pathos are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is fascinating and adorable! <br /> <br /> Every character is especially adorable and memorable, from the leads of Cher and Nicolas Cage to the many supporting roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even Grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers and Norman Jewison as a director surpass the usual quality in this ensemble work. For some of the actors, this was an early, big confrontation with the film, so the casting is also extraordinary - and we have many momentary powerhouses whose careers have been changed by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie through and through many times - which can sometimes significantly reduce the impact of a movie. Only a few years ago, I realized that every time I searched a scene from this movie - every scene - the scene was captivating and beautifully designed. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes that the original encounter between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage took place, in which Cage tells his story of suffering. Vincent Gardenia, with his penchant for the opera, discovered amidst the splendor his plumbing business produced for gold mines; Olympia Dukakis scolds John Mahoney for working with his student in the classic line about working with colleagues: "Do not shit where you eat!"; Danny Aiello at the bed of his dying mother; Nicolas Cage "Cher" "Cher" as the rapture of an aria rises in the background! <br /> <br /> There are of course many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially the original by Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry met Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> No one equals moonstruck!
