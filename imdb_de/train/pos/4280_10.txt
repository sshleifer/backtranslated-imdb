The group of people travels on a terrible bus to Belgrade, led by a drunken conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many humorous events that describe the fall of the nation in 1941 with much irony and are so funny that even today they are used as jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a four-meter farmer with his four sons, nearly twice his size. In the end, the movie makes a dramatic turn and the journey becomes a swan song of a dying country.
