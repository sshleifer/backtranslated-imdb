I have not read the other comments on the film, but from the average rating I can see that they are probably not very complementary. <br /> <br /> I have looked at it for the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. It was not that the adults were rolling across the floor, but the sound of childish joy made it seem that way. <br /> <br /> It's a real Mel Brooks farce with a lot of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not who we are, and how fickle our friends and associates are. There are many other films on a similar topic, no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. However, I can hardly imagine that this will affect the younger family members. <br /> <br /> Therefore for the children a 9/10 of mine.
