I already saw this on the cable in the early 90s and was thrilled. I never saw it again until it appeared on the cable recently. Still finding a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why it is not rated higher. I found everything about this film convincing. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can refer to the situation of Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is even more moving with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be more often seen on cables for the people. The human tribute to our soldiers does not stay on the battlefield. It will be brought home for the rest. And this movie is one of many that bring this home in a very hard way. Excellent movie.
