Musings: pure enjoyment from the beginning to the end. No laughter uprising, but a subtler, refined sense of humor. What a bonanza of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robard's Sr. Cary Grant to be framed at this time. A young carpenter, played by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "Lallies" trapped or something only a carpenter would know. Grant, who does not want to appear ignorant, answers yes. Then Barker shouts to his comrades: "Okay guys, he wants to hate them, so ... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear the tearing and tearing of about 20 large nails pulled from different boards. Everything Grant can do is complain. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is outdated. You would never see many carpenters working on a single-family home at the same time, and a place like this one in Connecticut would probably make a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie really a sweetheart.
