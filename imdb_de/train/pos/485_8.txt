"The Luzhin Defense" is a good movie with fine central performances, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through. In most of the movies, one sensed that the characters just kept on pushing the story. Marlene Gorris might have been able to examine the psyche of Luzhin instead of portraying him as a tortured innocent victim, torn apart by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not delve deeply into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's crack with her mother does not encounter a dramatic flashpoint in the film, but a crude disagreement between the mother. I felt that I had been through Luchin's torment and ultimately tragic end, without the joy of having his unusual and complex personality decoded. This was a moving and entertaining movie, but certainly not a great one.
