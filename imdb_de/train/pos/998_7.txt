This is a really interesting movie. It's an action movie with a mix of comedy. Foxx collaborates with Comedian Epps in this film to give it a comedic twist. You'll be wondering what's going to happen next with Foxx. It was a well-made film, the director used the right colors (dark blue colors) in this film to give him the right feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it's always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing that you did not see it. Definitely worth it if you are a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more credit than is actually given.
