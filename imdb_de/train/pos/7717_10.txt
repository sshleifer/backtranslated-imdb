I loved this movie all my life. It's also a smart story with many classic allusions. e.g. The ship that had been missing decades earlier was called Bellerophon. In classical mythology, this was the man who slew the Chimera, a legendary beast made up of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera - himself and his id-monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies where the authors have clearly attributed some intelligence to their audience, unlike most modern blockbusters that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 for a screenplay /> cheers
