Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, entertaining black comedy in which subversive young girls subtly kick the "system" in the ass. It's all about football and it's funny, it's really funny. The director says, "The venues are real, the event is real, as well as the characters and extras, so I deliberately chose not to use professional actors because their presence would have led to a misconception." The non-actors will immediately make you root, unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Outstandingly staged, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. It won the Jury Grand Prize 2006 in Berlin. Dear readers, it is almost perfect. WHERE, where can I get it?
