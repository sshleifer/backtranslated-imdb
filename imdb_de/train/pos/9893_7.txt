The poor geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is terribly burned because a ferocious April Fool has done a wrong job. Lightning a decade and everyone involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her twists in Maniac, Faceless and the latest horror movie) in prank are worried for the upcoming 10-year high school reunion, without being aware that a court jester is masked Killer hides in the (now closed) school and is out for revenge. <br/> <br/> Chaulk to a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. However, there is something that forces me to watch it occasionally (preferably with beer in hand). I'm even ready to miss the absolutely terrible end (I have to say that, I hate). I guess I like it because it has a fun atmosphere and some cool kills. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager both get topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the ladies): A free cock shot of Simon Scuddamore at the beginning of the movie , <br /> <br /> My Grade: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional trivia track; Trailer for this film; and followers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
