I saw this movie three times. Last time I skipped over and over confusing scenes to find the resolution for the plot. Maybe the plot is not meant to be logically related. Or maybe those rough points are in the plot, because Ann's memory of distant events is pretty flawed. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has attended a nameless college with the offspring of a rich family. She must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but she seems to have no family ties at all. She does not seem to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her catastrophic decisions come into force. Ann shares with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) a passionate evening. When Harris then comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repugnant and disgusted with her own behavior. I have to miss something essential here. Ann's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she still has deep feelings for her on her deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Harris had a crush on Ann and she wanted to get married. A scene that showed her chance encounter years after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationships. She always had a fight with her men and she refused. This pattern stopped at Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love, and she stayed with her husband until he died. Maybe Lila could start a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the convenient reappearance of Lila Ross on Ann's bed. Apparently, Ann's sister could gather enough information from Ann's last lucid moments to identify Lila and make contact. None of this communication appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> I wondered again and again in which house Ann lived in her last days. How could she afford to buy such a house because of the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed to be one step ahead of the financial catastrophe while raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I really enjoyed the scenery and the music of the movie. The villa by the sea was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was as bright as the young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette to the bottle-blonde look she had in the movie extras. If only those annoying CGI fireflies disappeared, I could increase the film by a whole point in my vote!
