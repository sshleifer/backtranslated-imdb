I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a normal cartoon ... except when the brassieres and bullets started to fly. I have to admit that this movie is going to upset anyone, because it's designed to discriminate against everyone. But the truth is that it's funny, just like hell. I recommend it to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try Fritz the Cat and the Nine Life of Fritz the Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki did that movie too. It is a cat that is going through hard times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I borrowed all these films. Since Coonskin was an offensive title at this time, he was also referred to as a street fighter. Ralph Bashki also did Cool World with a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
