This movie has given me nightmares for months and I'm 17 years old. This is the scariest movie ever made! This is no exaggeration !! I saw this film at school in English lessons, and no one else was scared, which amazed me. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I was not the only person who found this so scary !!
