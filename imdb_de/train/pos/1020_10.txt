"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic exploration of a team called SG-1 by a device called Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> After seeing this series sporadically It was the first seasons when it first came out. I did not know how good that show really would be, 10 years after I last watched an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple science fiction series, it's one of the best-made, interesting, long-lived, exciting science-fiction series ever produced. And why? Because it's on an amazing premise. <br /> <br /> This series value far surpasses that of the film on which it was founded and I think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is able to do something which does not work when the film is restricted in time. The sense of familiarity created by a long series of observations of the characters and their circumstances over time is mind-boggling and only helps to dispel unbelief, and all of this is the result of a great writing and great dedication entire crew The show. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" has been a great adventure over the past 10 years, but has never been afraid of the challenge of postponing the storyline, giving way to a number of very different periods of the show: < The first few seasons, maybe until the fourth or fifth, focused much more on exploring planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly independent, if not for the ever-threatening Goaul Threat. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th century, there were more and more episodes focused on the fight against the Goaul'd and the prevention of attacks on Earth. After these seasons, exploring the planets was almost an excuse to place sg-1 in a place with goaul'd / replicator / ori conflicts. <br /> <br /> - The eighth season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes involving minor earth affairs that barely mention the Stargate, but recent episodes have some great replica moments. <br /> <br /> - The 9th and 10th trips travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. They are both good sequels, although the first episodes of Season 10 are a little weak, as they seem to be a little more than when SG-1 and the human / Jaffa lose the battle for battle against the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after Season 7, the exploration was pushed into the background, which in many ways was a shame because the potential and secrets of each planet (an episode) were present. On the other hand, there were so many big episodes of ongoing conflict that changing the nature of the show was still working and showing how tall and brave the authors were. <br /> <br /> Even hard I believe the series I have a high quality finish that brings it to a nice quiet. My feeling is that it could go on; The people involved were all great professionals and the narrative of the series had a lot to offer. One last season returning to the beginning of the series was very feasible and would have been very welcome, but in the end things are just as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, because I enjoyed everything, it's a bit hard to find that it ends. However, the large picture drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, these outstanding actors and the characters we will always remember as a collective named SG-1.
