Fantastic documentary from 1924. This geography of early Iraq in the early 20th century was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before he made his Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later developed Cinerama, an idea that was probably used in filming the remarkable landscapes in this film. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this film a treasure, heartbreaking fighting stories, complemented by the land around them. Never was man's ability to endure so enduring. The fact that this was done when it was shows not only the will of the subjects, but also the filmmaker.
