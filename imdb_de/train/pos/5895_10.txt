I had read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before watching this movie. I've always been fascinated by a story of hope and overcoming life-changing events, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters gives you a feeling for the closeness of the family and how they positively influenced the lives of others. I can not go into the accuracy of certain details in this movie, it's common practice to use a creative license when managing a script. However, it depends on the spirit of Dan and his family. <br /> <br /> It's a worthwhile movie about a story that should be told. I felt compassion for the characters and cheered in the end.
