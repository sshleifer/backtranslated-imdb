Overall, the movie is fine. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that make me touch. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) behaved very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" by Nina Simone is really "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma". <br /> <br /> I love the song. Both the song. "Ne Me Quince Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Nice. <br /> <br /> And greetings to Yasmin. The end of the film makes me touched again. We can see how Yasmin truly valued her parents uniquely. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Prix Of International Jury of the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.
