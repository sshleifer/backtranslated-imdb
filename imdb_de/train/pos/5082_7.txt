The Secret Fury is in many ways a decidedly romantic suspense drama (directed by Mel Ferrer), which has front-runners in both Colbert and Ryan. it remains puzzling, if not quite gripping to the end, when implausibility conquers the attitude of unbelief - as so often in this genre. For some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the portrayal of the beating Leah by Vivian Vance - the immortal Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy". Strangely, Vance had very few film roles. her real home was Broadway, where she was taught (among other performances) for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid plays a subordinate role in a nefarious plan. See how she halfheartedly tries to wave the smoke away when she smokes a fake cigarette in the hotel laundry room - a transgression for which she eventually pays the highest penalty.
