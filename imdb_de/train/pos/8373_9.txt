Note to the previous reviewer: This film is, according to the scriptwriter "science fiction adaptation of the Iliad". Whether the references are painful or not, no excuse, it's the basis for the movie. They admit they stole ... although adapted, the P.C. Term. <br /> <br /> Great, but too short. Probably not as good as the author, director or studio wanted, but pretty damn funny. The fact that the studio has imploded while doing so only adds to its heritage. <br /> <br /> A remake on a big budget would not be so fun and probably would not do the script justice. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. A DVD release with some meager extras seems to be available, but I do not think it could be played on NTSC players. I am not an expert and I am still trying to find out. I am currently living with the VHS incarnation.
