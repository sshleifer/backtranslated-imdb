Unfortunately for myself - I came across this show late in his life. I only caught a few episodes (about three) before ABC canceled them. I loved the characters and the plot - but especially the BIG actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two familiar characters (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared") and Jay Hernandez (From Carlito's Path: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan) , I enjoy watching young actors do what they deserve, and I believe this show would further their careers. I hope this is at least released on DVD, and maybe WB will eventually pick it up for a second season? In the meantime, I see it on the ABC website from the beginning.
