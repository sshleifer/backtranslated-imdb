"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful movie, haunting and incredibly exciting. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who had a horrible sight in 1980 when he saw his 3-month-old baby brutally taken out of his family's tent while camping in the Australian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrific disappearance caused a veritable rush of life around the world. Meryl Streep, as always, perfectly lives up to Lindy's role. But one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate view of this vile case, tears are coming into your eyes. The concept is nothing less than terrifying, and afterwards you are persecuted, but also inspired.
