Men of honor have many great aspects. Good action sequences, many "feel-good scenes", a good score, but the movie really makes the movie. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor focuses on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American deep-sea diver in the navy. It tells its hard fight from the poor farmer to the diving school and even further. It's a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times. A person, despite adversity, can not give up until she reaches the goals she set for sentimental reasons a few years ago. It could happen, but many of the struggles faced by the brashear faces in the film are questionable, including the C.O. from the diving school manipulated with his last test. All this, however, is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, the instructor of the diving school who visits Brashear. Once Deniro comes in, he lets go of this atmosphere of extreme arrogance that you can not hate unless you have unbelievable willpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro makes several speeches in which you would laugh at how cool he is, but you are too stunned by the way he pierces them. In the end, you need to question some aspects of the movie, but admit it. If it were the whole truth, you would slumber it in the first twenty minutes.
