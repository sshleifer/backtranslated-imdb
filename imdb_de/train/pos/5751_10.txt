What can I say about this movie? I have seen it several times since I was about 6 years old for the first time. I have seen the english version and it is very well done. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more intended for kids. I love the childish humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
