"Deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films that come from this wonderful decade of the 70s, from which so many other commercial exploitation films emerged. <br /> <br /> A group of friends embark on a canoe trip down the river to the south, victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who want to ruin their lives. It is great. <br /> <br /> We are treated for anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc. Similar to 1974's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to say "liberation" is believable would be immature, even in the dark days of 1972 this would never happen. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very entertaining ride and full of action, it's one in a huge pile of commercial films from the early '70s, and it's (probably) on this heap with great acting, excellent cinematography, and excellent writing.8 out of 10 children.
