Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a way, it had a better story than the other films that aimed at a higher age. Although this film at times required a solid attention span. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger viewers expected a comedy, but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have only seen parodies. After a short time all Atlantis seemed to be watching very intensively.
