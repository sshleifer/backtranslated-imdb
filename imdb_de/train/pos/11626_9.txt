This is an excellent, fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which leaves the supernatural aside for 85 minutes and introduces something scary - the evil of humans. It is much more likely that we encounter the benevolent evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer. The appearances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, from The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. The film usually takes place on a very intimate level between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is an action on a small scale, not the width of the canvas, and it is no less compelling for these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although of course you can only do so much with a camera around a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story taut. There are no distractions, no negotiations confuse the topic, the core of which is a struggle between the main characters. By focusing and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to transform a very minimal action into an exciting action thriller.
