The story of a drifter, his ranch boss and the daughter of the boss is not for all tastes, but fascinating. It's set in the beautiful country of New Zealand, in the middle of a landscape that we've come to know so well through other films from this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I had seen the excellent Mary Regan, and I have since become a fan of her. The cast also features Bruno Lawrence, whom the American public from the movie "Smash Palace" probably remembers best. Terence Cooper takes a turn as a ranch owner who pays too much attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Sharply traded, with unforgettable shocking performances of all his leads. I first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America, but trust me, the untranslated version is unmistakable.
