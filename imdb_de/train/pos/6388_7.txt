Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before I saw it: <br /> <br /> * - It's officially Disney's first animated science fiction adventure. I'm not sure how exactly that is (I like Nitpick), but it made me curious when I first heard it was described. <br /> <br /> * - The preview was pretty damn cool for the most part. Obviously it was also "too cryptic" according to some critics. <br /> * - It seemed so bad that Disney said, "Screw it, let's re-release Spy Kids." <br /> <br /> So, with all that's being said, what's the movie like? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a fool for animated fantasy, which includes touching music and rampant special effects anyway, but "atlantis" does it all. It's a return to all CGI Eye Candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin," so much so that it's almost the best-of-show of an effects animator. The characters may not be so memorable (except perhaps for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is a bit boring, but this is not a movie you see for the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a controversy that bothers me. The "failure" (as in "only", "it" only "took" about "five hundred million or something; I know animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars of it) compared to the popularity of" Shrek "and" Monsters Inc. "was seen as proof of the death of traditional animation, I do not think that's true, how do you explain the movie" South Park ", what about" Final Fantasy "? Art is really everything, not the method, I do not know what Disney's comeback movie will look like, but I do not think they're still out of the picture.
