The concept of having Laurel & Hardy in the role of chimney sweep this time is amazingly funny. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, especially from Stan Laurel of course. <br /> <br /> The film also has a subplot with a crazy professor working on a rejuvenation formula. It does not really sound like a logical mix of storylines and incoherent, but both plotlines blend perfectly into the memorable ending. It's still a bit weird, but it's still weird, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supportive cast of the movie is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is great because the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield as a crazy professor are deliciously outstanding. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with excellent, timely and funny constructed sequences, all of which are quite predictable but still funny because they are all executed. It all helps to turn "Dirty Work" into one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
