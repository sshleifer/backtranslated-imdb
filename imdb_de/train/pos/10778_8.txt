Well, this show looks like most other shows of this kind from the mid-90s, but the only thing is that it's different. She uses a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a bit of drama too. Personally, I thought it was a good show. I can not understand why they are canceled. The good news is that the fanbase of this show has been up to date since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope the WB is bringing the show back or even making a movie that I know will come Impossible to do, but hey it does not hurt to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you did not see it, I would recommend finding the DVD of all 13 episodes because The Characters are great, the storylines are good, the comedy is good and the whole show is just great ,
