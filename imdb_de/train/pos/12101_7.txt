I remember watching this movie as a boy at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin, and the corpse inside it, was for me the scariest part of the film, only compounded by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people who ended up hanging out in the trees until I realized the part of the film that changed Blackblood's blackwood surname because there was a character in the family history that was known for his many hangings of different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to avoid kicking by contributing to his family's deaths. I also noticed that when Foster enters the cemetery gate for the first time, he attentively notices the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
