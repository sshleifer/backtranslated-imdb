Comment? How is my comment necessary? We talk about every masterpiece of all time, for all seasons and generations. This is just a kind of film that I still have patience with. As in other Disney films, this is a kind of magic. All characters are in some ways "alive" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language (as I did not understand it the first time I watched the movie, since I was about six years old old was ). Maybe my English is not that good, but I've learned what I know most about these types of films, and this is another big dimension of this kind of film, which is rare these days. But it is a great shame. In my country, it is now impossible to watch this or any other Disney movie. We have no copyright, so our children are disabled to enjoy this kind of movies. So will we see this movie once again "Once upon a Dream" or ...?
