It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as convincing as a simple but nice daughter of Robert Farnsworth, who finally shows in his last role what a good actor he was. It's hard to believe that this is a David Lynch movie. It's slow and even, sweet and moving. One of the best if you do not like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
