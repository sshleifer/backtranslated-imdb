When watching this movie, I was a bit skeptical, because fantasy movies are not always my thing. Especially a romantic fantasy. I did not know that I would ride the magic of the movie. Everything in the film, from plot to dialogues to effects, was almost perfect. Claire Danes shines like the star she has in this movie. From beginning to end you fall in love more and more with this character. Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as a wicked witch who wants to conquer the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a loveable character that gives the audience the most comic relief as the movie gains in height. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a movie that surprised and excited me as a movie fan. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining movie that's fun for kids and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
