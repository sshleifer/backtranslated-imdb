The first time I saw this "movie" I was thrilled. When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew older, I became more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to Bad), it was still entertaining. The "Badder" sequence could be left out, though the kids were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when policeman Michael said, "I need your autograph here," after he stopped him for dancing in a no-dance zone. But "Smooth Criminal" is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as Toughie (and those hairs were wild). Dancing is perfect, as are the special effects. The only thing I could do without was the spiders. Every fan of Michaels should see this, if you have not already done so. I give it 10+!
