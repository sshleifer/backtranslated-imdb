The year 2000 had been a bad year for Indian films due to the lack of quality and imagination of the directors. Except for Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing was noticed. CCCC had great controversy over the financing of the film, and since he did not really know what the movie is about, he has gained a good reputation and high ticket sales for the film in India and abroad. The only information was that it was an exciting thriller. The movie was released in 2001 and the movie was surprisingly good. The main presentation has to do with surrogacy and is well handled. Salman And Preiti perform well, with Salman not even taking off his shirt. Must be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but is a little less demanding compared to Preiti, who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main guides confirm that, according to Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have solid chemistry on the screen and off the screen (apparently). Salman Khan plays a serious role as a successful businessman in the film and is abused in his other films as a would-be comedian, as he is underestimated in the film industry in Mumbai due in part to the films he has selected. Rani's character does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the very end ... this kept her and the rest of the family behind ... the rest you should find out as this will ruin the movie if I told you so. The songs are all well portrayed, especially deboning walon and the main title song. The other supporting actors make a minimal but fine effort as Salman's loving family. Abbas Mastan produced a hit and treated the theme of the film tactfully. I say go and look at it or lend it what you want!
