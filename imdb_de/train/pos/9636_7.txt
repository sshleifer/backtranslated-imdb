A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), who is on holiday in summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the beautiful Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow, this is a very frustrating movie. On the one hand, I was fascinated by it and really felt for the two boys. On the other hand, I got annoyed - the movie is constantly flashing from the past to the present without any meaning or reason. It is very confusing and meaningless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also lots of plotting holes - Mathieu will eventually do something that will make him end up in the hospital. What is it - we are never told! Then he puts an end to Cedric and tells everyone that he lives with him. Why? We are not told then inexplicably he joins another man. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city, but it is a tribute to the movie that you are really interested in the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, pretty and has a nice body - but he can not act. His idea of ​​acting is to sit around with a blank expression all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is very pretty, has a very nice body and is a fucking actor. He also has an incredible sexual attraction. There is a complete frontal nudity, lots of kisses, and a pretty explicit sex scene in the movie that's great - most movies are afraid to show male love scenes. This is not the case and it helps to see how the characters are interested and feel each other. <br /> <br /> Well, a frustrating movie, but something worth seeing - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - so if you like handsome naked young men! <br /> <br />
