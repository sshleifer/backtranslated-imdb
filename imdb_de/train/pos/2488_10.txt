For me, the closing scene, in which Harris responds to the press conference, is worth considering this intelligent and timeless piece of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real" Pols responded in an intelligent, articulated way, like Mr. Harris, then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press might think twice before appearing irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that absolutely nothing Bidding has to deal with a candidate's ability to effectively face the challenges of the office he / she is looking for.
