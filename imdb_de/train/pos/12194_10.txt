The surreal film noir appeared shortly after the "real" genre-defining classics "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Welles films should not be judged against others. He played according to different rules. In fact, he played. This begins where others Femme Fatale movies stop and so the vague logical (but interesting) Something is a representation of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid-fire style), decorated dialogue (much "hard-core" philosophy) and unusual spectacle (good Hayworth probably deliberately one-dimensional). Welles' genre may have meant "formula," but he seemed to use "mysteries" as the background for his "conversations."
