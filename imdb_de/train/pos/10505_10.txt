Yes that's true. I am firmly convinced that the N64 and the strange-looking controller were designed to make this game possible. It was amazing when I saw it for the first time, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. The gameplay is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and it has the Nintendo charm that is always so incredible, but indisputably there. A must for every N64 owner and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else.
