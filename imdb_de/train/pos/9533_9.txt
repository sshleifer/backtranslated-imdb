That could not have been better. The strong limitations of Mike Sullivan's facial expressions could not have been presented in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. The young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel. To play the basic character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman has been showing one of his best in character for a long time. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father / son story in which the two candidates are in principle only unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, and John Rooney picked him up. Although Mr. Rooney was a generous man, he became involved in organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt should only be paid for by incorporating it into the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and tries to bring his children to safety but at the same time repay his boss. The events that follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a great adaptation by David Self, the dialogue rarely appears but is very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930s environment (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh), which is covered with a dark, rainy exterior (snow on the ground). The story is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score, which only sets in when it's needed. <br /> <br /> However, the most important technical element of the film is the beautiful photograph by Conrad L. Hall. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. and I watch a lot of films. The scene where Mike and Michael are in the car and entering Chicago is pretty impressive. The shot begins at the front of the car and reveals Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Then he rolls around to the side of the car and sees Michael (Hoechlin) waking up from his side window. As it continues, it drives back sideways and dollys, completely around the car, revealing a beautiful scenic Chicago of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and a large crew, the captain creates an outrageously amazing movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (won several prizes) Prior to joining American Beauty, Mendes worked as a director for the British Theater, but decided he wanted to continue that it was nothing new in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes has been named one of the great directors in my book (in a list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film highlights a bold genre that has hits and misses and brilliantly expresses the true theme. Photography, acting and history is a phenomenon. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's gang from New York, but for now I'm absolutely confident that this is the "Best Movie of the Year". Given the competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) this is a strong statement.
