I finally had the desire to see this in a movie theater. I saw Fritz Lang's movie on video several years ago. I had hoped that ideal screening conditions would work their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were ideal for Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine print in full length. Subtitles in the original Gothic script German with simultaneous English translation, exactly, without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie bubbled for a short time but ultimately failed, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This film has no real relation to Wagner's Ring Cycle, as I already knew, but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th century. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - has a lot to offer Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Hun and her desire for revenge on Hagen and Gunther, the renamed Nibelungen, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular altercation in this film has probably evolved and expanded in the Wagnerian myth to its Götterdämmerung, Götterdämmerung and the end of Walhall. This movie stays on earth. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The massive sets compete with those of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration sets new standards in barbarian splendor. There is a huge cast of scarred, mangy Huns and Art Deco burgundies. And battles. Battles that seemingly never end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful with her revenge plan. She manages to destroy everything around her. Her loyalty to her martyr Siegfried does not seem to be so much due to love or devotion, but to something that comes closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "Let me go!" She knew that she was not emotionally prepared for what she had to do. But Kriemhild shows no normal human emotions, and certainly nothing is the feminine principle. She is already "filled with the highest cruelty" to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a scowl. I do not want to exaggerate, but that look is really the only expression that "revives" Kriemhild's face. It's the ultimate one-note game. However, it is clearly intended, not just a case of bad behavior. <br /> <br /> What we offer then is a one-dimensional sketch of a vengeful Fury. Some may consider Kriemhild a powerful heroine. I just see the movie as misogynist.
