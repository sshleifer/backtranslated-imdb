"The Man in the Moon" is a beautifully realistic view of life from the eyes of a teenager. Director Robert Mulligan magically creates scriptwriter Jenny Wingfield from her childhood with a beautiful camera and a haunting, lyrical score. This movie has come home to one of the most powerful and emotional films of recent times. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible, all top notch, especially Sam Waterston and an amazing performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel every sense as this life-changing summer of 1957 at the Trant family farm comes to a close. <br /> <br /> "The Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991 and you will love the fact that most of you have probably never heard of family and friends. Buy this DVD and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is really the essence of filmmaking at its best.
