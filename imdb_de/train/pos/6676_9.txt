****** WARNING: CAN SPOILERS INCLUDE ************* <br /> <br /> So, who are these "Mystery Men"? Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live their youthful fantasy life while abusing their real identity as well as their superior identity. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works on the site during the day, leaving his wife and children at home at night as he drives down the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to bridal couples during the day and hurls dishes at crazy villagers in the evenings if his mother does not give him the latest snoop. Mr. Furious works in a junkyard to earn his pay. Then he exposes his frustration with his friends at night, hurls ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe and threatens to get really angry (which everyone wonders, "What?")?). Ben Stiller breathes so much life into this character that you can just love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights capturing the 'moment of glory' they dream of ... that they really become superheroes. Of course it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough company logos on his costume to stop one or two extra bullets. Greg Kinnear presents himself in an outstanding performance as a middle-aged sell-out trying to regain his fans' attention in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back this "extra magic" that the Endorsements could regain, C.A. Free Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top threat played to perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This crazy genius has created a "Psychofrakulator" to make Champion City a reflection of his own insane spells ... and ends with C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men behind to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such followers as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. Recruitment begins after a painful recruiting party, and the team teams up with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only talent on the team, seemingly enlivening her mystical bowling ball with the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who wants to become invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the spleen (Paul Reubens), which was granted mystically strong flatulence by an angry Gypsy; and the under-utilized Sphinx (Wes Studi), which is shown to cut weapons with her mind in half, spends the rest of the movie spitting out inhuman puzzles and over-acting. > This movie is really a cross genre bauble. Anyone who wants to put movies in small categories struggles with defeat. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets that are endlessly recycled (and occasionally adorned with more parody material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic genre gets pretty good news. But at the same time, it's also a serious superhero movie. Both at the same time. An idea that is not necessarily unique in itself (for example, this film somehow mirrors D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic world, which requires suspension of unbelief anyway, and then throws the inevitable desire for desire - and we all know if superheroes are real, so these guys would be real too. If the Big Guy flew with the S in New York City, you'd see half a dozen messages about underwear jerks who regularly kick their asses. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the superhero world. But do they turn that into real superheroes? Only in their heads. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable when trying to highlight the ridiculous nature of the superheroes. One-liners fly, while comic geniuses throw away a lot of things on stage. Especially wonderful is the dialogue of Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball / her father. This is not a comedy in the sense of co-acting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really ventures into anything. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie is that it ends up being very good engaging. The weak / lame good guys are ultimately eligible and become superheroes for a glittering moment. Justice is served; and the film ends with a scene that smells of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses are the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the movie, the movie can be a great move. <br /> <br /> Of course, no film is perfect. Claire Forlani is as boring and directionless as Mr. Furious's love interest, though he plays an important role as a conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own ranks as crazy inventor dr. Heller, although his opening scenes, which pick up retired ladies in the nursing home, are worth a look alone. And the villagers are never more than violent lackeys (a point the film refers to). The cinematography is choppy and incoherent (as is the case in an average comic book, so excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never well integrated into the rest. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, this movie is amazing. You probably need to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to truly appreciate this movie, but it's a fun move and a great way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
