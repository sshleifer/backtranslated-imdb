In my work, I am occasionally contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to release their film. If I can, I watch those low budget movies and I often think that the future of Hollywood is about dogs. Occasionally, however, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if it was created to remind the film industry that good films are still possible. The short BROKEN directed by Alex Ferrari is a real surprise and worth a second look. <br /> <br /> After nearly 20 minutes, BROKEN attempts a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no background story. The audience is lowered in the middle of the action without knowing what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) awakens from a dream to hear a shot and is then abducted from her home. When she wakes up, she's surrounded by a group of mercenaries who look like they're in a comic book. These bad guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all rifles and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The kicker here is that despite his low-budget movie, he does not play like one. From the beginning you have the feeling that B R O K E E was filmed, edited and produced by professionals. It looks like Quentin Tarantino did something on his day off when he jammed with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, looks good and feels like something big. <br /> <br /> Acting is way better than I normally see in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the head murderer Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few speaking roles in the movie, it's up to them to wear the movie. No special effects, no matter how good they would have saved this movie from bad acting. Luckily, Polay manages to express real fear, and Gordon manages to become a true psycho. Some of the more limited roles seem to be less talented, but it hardly shows. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of B R O K E E is that it lasts only 20 minutes. The story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a little thoughtful and barely subtle. When I saw this, I felt I had an epiphany, but it just felt that it was much more worldly than I had hoped. The film tries to be one of the puzzles where the audience speaks for hours in the local caf√©, but it is unsatisfactory. I always think that these are the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. MY EVALUATION: 8 out of 10.
