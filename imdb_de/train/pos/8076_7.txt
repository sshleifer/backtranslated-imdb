Family are two families who are looking for each other for blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is an underworld that operates from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once he accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother, wants to avenge his brother's death. He abducts the family of Viren Sahay for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where instead of the dialogues the expression counts more. Akshay's tiny role has also equated him with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala did in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few loose spots in the script; to like; Amitabh was portrayed as the city's most wanted criminal, though he walks in the city unscathed. The abduction of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a big Don have no security protection?
