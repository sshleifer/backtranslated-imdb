By that I mean that this is not a well-made movie, but it's a very good version of the real event and the best representation yet. And if you're a WW2 fan, this is a treat for you, because there are three out of four saboteur members involved in this movie. It's theater at best, but that's still half a documentary, as I said. <br /> <br /> Personally, I am a tough fan of our almost superhuman Heroes of World War II, and there should be hundreds of them. From these films we show what they have done so that they will not be forgotten by the next generations. Children do not read books today but watch movies. <br /> <br /> So if you want an action extravaganza, hire Private Ryan, that's the truth about lasting pain, outrageous stamina and the will to fight when everything seems to be lost.
