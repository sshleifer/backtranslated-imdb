My observations: Hilarity after the war. Tom Drake and Grandpa of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed adorable and pretty. Margaret Hamilton is good as always; smaller part than in "Wizard of Oz". By the way, Spring Byington is prettier, even with the bold little nose that Hamilton does not have. Tent scene at the end with the former boy next door was hilarious. As a two-year veteran of Army tents, he looked quite youthful and inexperienced when I looked him in the eye. Unfortunately it has disappeared and faded in the dark. We were famous for these great showcases used to lure passers-by into the store and get them to buy all those wonderful goods. <br /> <br /> 10/10
