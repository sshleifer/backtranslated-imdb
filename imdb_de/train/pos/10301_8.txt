Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best images since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time. Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in some funny jokes. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but above all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in there is where Jim messes up the anchorman's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
