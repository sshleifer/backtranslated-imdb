Fox's epic tale of one of the greatest pioneering achievements of an American state comes on DVD with truly outstanding "extras." BRIGHAM YOUNG (The "Frontiersman" has been added for the European release). He tells the story of the great pioneer guide who brought under inspiration members of the Mormon faith (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs found their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price ), he was put on the screen in 1940 when America was just entering World War II. It was a brave move against Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormons, as this was the first film attempt to show their faith favorably on the silver screen. Now, in collaboration with James D'Arc, Curator of Brigham Young University's Award-winning Motion Picture Archive in Provo, Utah, Fox has dubbed this film in an outstading edition. Mr. D'Arc, who made his PhD thesis a few years ago, has delivered one of the most detailed commentaries ever made for a DVD. He separates the fact from the fiction and lets the listeners understand why these films were so appreciated by the Church's leaders, even though the beautification of the truth went all over the film. One of the funny pieces deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film, he married a Latter-day Saint woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There's a lot to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have this as part of the DVD! On the CD are over 100 images from the Fox & BYU archive as well as newsreel recordings of the incredible premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another excellent DVD - and thanks, James D'Arc for your great comment!
