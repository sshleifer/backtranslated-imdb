Set aside the UFO "thing". This was the best documentary I have ever seen. Factual reports by Neil and Buzz ... a must. The interviews and coverage are a revelation, as most of the information was classified as confidential in 1969 and only published in 2006. No documentary has the details or the accuracy for such a short 47 minutes ... The FACTS will blow you and you down The risks that the first on the moon are left in awe ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest heroes of ours Time. Do you ever see a man who saves his own life? Do not bet. Neil saves his life when only seconds separated him from death. Amazing to see. It is a travesty that people did not know all the details associated with landing on the moon and the courage of these men in connection with certain death, from a failing computer ... 10 stars!
