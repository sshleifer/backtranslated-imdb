I love this movie, but the music at all alumni gatherings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played in Die TÃ¤nze etc. are from the 1950s and very early 1960s. <br /> <br /> After attending my 30th Gymnasium, I can assure you that the last music will be played at a reunion or dance at the former high school. People are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music of the 1970s - we all know what was musical for a sad time. But it was not completely deprived, and the producers of the film had to worry more. I found these dance scenes very upsetting for my otherwise willing suspension of unbelief in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This was a bad decision of the director and / or the producer.
