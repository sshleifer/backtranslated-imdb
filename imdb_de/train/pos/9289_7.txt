In BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a genuine United States envoy who had truly opened Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him Commodore Perry urged basically with gunboats to Japan and forced the Japanese in 1853 a contract. Harris, who came a little later, worked on the details and helped to ensure compliance - as many Japanese had no particular inclination to honor the first contract. All that is true and will be shown in the film. According to some other sources I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly a fiction, and this romance is the focus of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction the first When I saw this movie, I was surprised. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! If he is diplomatic in most movies, please say and thank him while beating people !!!! So it was very strange to see him play a man who is NOT a man of action and can play the diplomatic game. I can not imagine that too many actors in 1958 were more unusual for this role. Incidentally, I've seen photos of Harris, and Wayne has virtually no resemblance to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the story, which has a lot of freedom with the truth and the weird casting, the movie is still very good to see. The color cinematography is beautiful, the film shows some nice insights into Japanese customs and culture and the spectacle is not bad. All in all a nice and worth watching movie despite its strange casting. PS - Read the little things about this movie. You'll learn a bit more about the real-life characters, as well as an alleged fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), in which Wayne apparently knocked him down !! Based on what I read about Huston and how he got along with actors, I think this is an incident. And it's also a fine example of John Wayne's "diplomacy."
