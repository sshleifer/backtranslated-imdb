I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven years old, the movie was 13. We were so young ... But I have always thought of the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> At that time, I realized how much a nation can hardly be commanded and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, that is between people sharing daily life, seeing each other's faces, calling each other names, but belonging to different worlds , can only appear. In the most critical moments, a disturbing question then arises: "Who should we be loyal to first?", Which people, family, motherland, the person you know in your area? You have no time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with a victim of himself. Somewhere confused a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities, which we can see today, because this death disappears life that I lived, I shared the unconditional friendship with my child. It was lived by the spectator that I was. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. When I left later, my beautiful childhood, as I departed from so many worlds in which I lived. I've left all this forever and these lines are a short visit today that I did not expect to get up this morning.
