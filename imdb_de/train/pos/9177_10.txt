I have to say that this mini-series was the best interpretation of the popular novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible as Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but no comparisons with this one. The best for me. I could never imagine anyone ever playing those characters again. The last time I last saw it was in 1984, when I was only 13 years old. At the time, I was a bookworm and had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember that I did not miss any of the episodes. I would like to see it again because it is so good. :-)
