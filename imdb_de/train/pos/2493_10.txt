Typical 90s comedy, sitcom, similar to our today's "My Family". Since Thatcher is the culmination of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything she can. "Bloody Thatcher" may be shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, minces the brain with bread knives, Jenny, the moody older teenage kid who cares only for boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as hard as possible to help their family fight the economic climate of the early 1990s. Granted, the first two series were not as successful as the latter, but starting with Series 3 everything starts with more laughter that I want to count. Overall, this show did not have the best air time and it would have taken a bit longer. Obviously, they could not go on after Gary Olsen's death, but I think they should bring back "Catherine Tate", the "Little Britain" office and the classics!
