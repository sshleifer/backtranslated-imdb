... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. Despite all the comments I write here, I prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more coherent plot. <br /> <br /> However: Davis' Mildred's raw emotions seem more like a sloppy girl who seems to become a prostitute easily. <br /> <br /> And it's these raw emotions that * make up part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has feelings of desperation, of failure, of "being different" - strong feelings that he suppresses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows her feelings immediately and without blame. She has no feelings of despair or failure or "being different"; Rather, she only survives as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred character than Davis's, almost through the movie. Davis' Mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he disgraces her - for her way of keeping body and soul together and constantly exploiting his love for her - she may unleash the most passionate rejection of snobbery more sacredly than you've ever seen on screen:! I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was outstanding, Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> Agree IMDb votes!
