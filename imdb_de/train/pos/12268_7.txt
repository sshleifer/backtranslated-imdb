Seven young people are looking for a bear in the forest. Soon they are persecuted by a crazy Vietnam veteran and brutally murdered. "Trampa Infernal" is a pretty entertaining Mexican slasher who reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". The movie is and there are some good death scenes, such as neck throat or ax in the throat. Unfortunately, there is not much thrill, so fans of Grand Guignol will be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of Slasher movies, take a look at this rarity. Mexican horror movies are pretty obscure (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason, this ingenious one To see Slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
