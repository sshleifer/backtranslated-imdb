In the beginning I loved g√∂ta kanal 1, there were a lot of classic jokes, including the unfortunate guy in the canoe, who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, but in my opinion his performance is not as funny as in the first movie, in fact, you do not notice him at all. What made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats. There are only racing boats in this film. They are fast, but they do not make waves like the big floating villas of the first movie Better, and these new boats make one of the last scenes look ridiculous as the man suddenly jumps out in the canoe to the "big waves" of those little fast boats dodge. Really a minus. One has to admit that we are no longer living in Sweden like in 1974. This film also contains a little more violence than the first one. Although the movie was great overall. I was just focusing on some downsides that I was disappointed with, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so look at that! It is worth the money.
