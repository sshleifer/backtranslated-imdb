This is a good example of a movie that is worth seeing, despite its low rating. The story is gripping and it's not long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. The acting is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it feels like the director can not decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's depiction of the law-abiding and shy Englishman with porn S.M. Magazines hidden in the bedroom make many moments laugh! As well as the look in Nicole Kidman's eyes, as she offers John the first impression of intimacy for a long time ... Other times give the actors and especially Nicole Kidman this comedy a rather dramatic inclination.
