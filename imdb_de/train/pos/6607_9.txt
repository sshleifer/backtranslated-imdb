I would give it almost 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that do not have an overview of the guide and affect the flow / continuity of the movie. The plot is great and well composed. You will definitely want to see this calm to fully understand it. The characters are complicated and also the plot, you just expect so much information that you do not have to scratch your head anymore. It's a movie that explains everything in the end. The animation is great and the combination of Femme Fatal and Film Noir makes for a great movie that is unlike anything else I've seen in the animation. It's a black-and-white movie, and in some scenes it's quietly dark, so it's worth watching on a good TV or plasma. The character voices save this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if it had given French accents to underline that it is Paris. It pays to buy DVD or BlueRay if you have it! And if you liked this movie, you might like it too. Living & Spirit in a Shell 2 Innocence awake, this is just a personal suggestion.
