The Villian in this movie is a mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he does, that's what makes him so mean. I do not think most men will like this movie, especially if they ever betrayed their wife. This is one of those movies that are pretty mean to the end. But then there you have it, a candy bar end that makes me look back and says "HOKIE AS HELL". A pretty good movie until the end. The end is the end that we would like to see, but not the end of such a beginning. And then there is the aftermath of what happened. I think you can give yourself a picture of the true end. I have the feeling that only one figure should have survived in the end.
