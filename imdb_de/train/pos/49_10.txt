If you "get it", it's great. <br /> <br /> If you do not, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting" does not necessarily mean that you have gone through a school shoot. There is so much more to this film that shooting at school sometimes becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a film about acceptance, superficial - of a traumatic event, as well as of people who are different for some reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie about unbearable pain and how different people endure it. In this case, the antagonism between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such grave concern that in the middle of the film we wonder how the director might possibly get a happy ending out of his hat. Fortunately, the public has the honor of being human. Our intelligence is not offended by an acid, implausible moral end. <br /> <br /> In addition, I try to keep my head clear that movies are fiction and everything else. I have to admit, I cried like a lost baby during this movie. There were certain things that hit people very close to home * and opened old wounds that were never completely healed. That is not necessarily a bad thing.
