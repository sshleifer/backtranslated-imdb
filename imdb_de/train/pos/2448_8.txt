Yes, it is exaggerated, yes, it is a bit cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a total baby and deserves to be seen again and again! The jokes and gags may become old and repetitive after some time, but the show is still fun. Since it's a family show, the humor is toned down and the authors have integrated family values ​​and ideals between the gags. George Lopez is funny. Do not take him seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he did not intend his character to be serious or a model of virtue. His outbursts and cheers are funny ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that Benny is the only big, dark, bitter point. I hate the character ... so much so that every time I turn it on for more than 30 seconds I have to mute the TV so I do not have to hear it. There is nothing funny about their dialogue or their jokes. As a mother, she must be the worst, and I'm shocked and surprised that George's character would be such a lousy person for so long. I think I see Benny. Seeing them is much better than seeing the Bill Engvall show. Now there is a bad sitcom ...
