I love Sabrina! It's one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are: the one in which she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode, and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones, but they were better than the last series, which was awful. Valerie was a good character as she was rounder than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were incredible, and there seemed to be no explanation as to where they were going. Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as their other friends.
