I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old - that was 33 years ago - and I never forgot that movie! The brave little boy and the beautiful eagle have touched and moved me deeply. And I just could not believe it when he turned into an eagle when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die ... My sister was in the movie with me and I recently asked her if she remembered the movie that We saw with the boy and the eagle, she said, that she remembered as if we had only seen it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget him - just like my sister and I ...
