I saw this movie for the first time at a festival. There were a lot of good movies, but few left me thinking about that for a long time, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The pictures were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in his role, which she created perfectly. There was not much to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we took care of him. And Ellen - I can not wait to see where she ends up! She shows a lot of talent and I hope she will make some more movies. With all those millions of dollars trying to get a cheap thrill, Tess shows that all this is unnecessary, as long as there is a good story and actors. Kudos to all who are involved with this film. And thanks to Tess and co. for distribution on DVD!
