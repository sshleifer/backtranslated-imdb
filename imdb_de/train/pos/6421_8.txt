"Men of Honor" - a true story about a proud and persevering black diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that is both touching and entertaining, and is part of the absolute cream of the New Millennium Cinema. Wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something special and to have a nice experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful because the rough, bitter and ruthless chieftain Billy Sunday - a role written for him practically. This film is next to fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) two of the latest evidence that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Men of Honor" performs excellently by Cuba Gooding Jr., who is one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz and the Hood". "Men of Honor" goes straight into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "As good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a talented and fantastic actor, and I'm ready to receive more great films from him. "Men of Honor" also has a very good story and probably the most exciting dive sequences in movie history. This is a great, fascinating movie that I can only recommend.
