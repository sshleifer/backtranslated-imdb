Soapdish could be considered one of the most undervalued films of all time. <br /> <br /> An outstanding, selfless cast that knew exactly where the movie was going and what roles it played. While everyone was stirring it up, there was no one-upmanship. Kline showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to have a fun conversation while another talked. I could just keep going.
