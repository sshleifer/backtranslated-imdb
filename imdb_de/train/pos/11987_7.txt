Since reviewing this classic, I have decided to review it in more detail, but first some insider notes from a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those I grew up with, it pleased my childhood, it did a great job, I miss a lot of this stuff today that we clearly do not see as much as Back then, good to the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin or Luftens Helte, as it's called in Denmark, is a great animated series. It's like Chip and Dale, Ducktales, and many of those old ones, so that it surrounds that weird feeling, I can not. Remember this series as I would like. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion it was very good, she came with some kind of message, not so wild of a message, but it is one of the old ones so can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to sound old or anything, but I feel like the time has slipped out of my hands with these cartoons. Today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else that is so weird, we have all these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel like we're not in cartoons or real shows have the same spirit as we did in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Now I may be wrong, but I feel like the time has changed too much. To conclude, I would be upset if this series, like Talespin, reappeared on the TV screen, rather than all New My, give me back my cartoons from my childhood, give them to the children I have one day You again ...
