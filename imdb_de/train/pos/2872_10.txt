In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was really devilish. You need to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful woman, although she was very much in the household. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before I summarize, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film performs very well. Finally, I recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it yet. You have a good time, go to the video store, rent or buy it, sit back with a friend and look at it.
