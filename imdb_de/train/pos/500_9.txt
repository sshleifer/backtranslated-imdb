"Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, a pop song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. sign up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", nobody misses you! Continue on Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
