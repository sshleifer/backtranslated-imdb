I saw FIDO in a movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The movie feels like a comic book that captures the look and feel of the surreal 50s perfectly. They've known the whole decade when they danced to Elvis while they dropped atomic bombs into the desert just to taste the whole thing. People were so naive at the time that it's scary and the idea that these clean-cut people would find it normal to have zombies, because pets really work here. Excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the Kid , <br /> <br /> It's a shame the movie was not a big success. It deserves more recognition. It's much better than the stuff of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Well. It is nevertheless an instant classic.
