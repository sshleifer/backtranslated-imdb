This movie has several things to offer. It is a "feel good story". The characters and actors are personable, realistic and present good performances. Most importantly, I think Dennis Quaid can grab and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked great both in throwing and hitting a bat in The Natural, and Kevin Costner in For Love of the Game and Bull Durham. In Major League, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and this image was pure stupidity - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many previous baseball movies, though the stories might be interesting, showed such a shortage. In terms of the baseball abilities of the leads, they were ridiculous in this regard. In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command," Jimmy Stewart, as a professional baseball player, looked as credible as your overweight, non-athletic player. An older uncle in softball game at the family reunion. Other male and physically strong stars (such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander, Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed some baseball skills in the late rounds during "election" for a game at Sunday picnic (even if Coed and even if your uncle was there). <br /> <br /> The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the scenes he tried with the Devil Rays, and the ones he played in two minor leagues and the American League, are all true. The participants are credible and capable. He is also a dedicated actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate character (with the exception of some of his "over-the-top" scenes and his forced accent in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely here at the finish, and this movie is a "9", as good or better as any of the other genres, except "The Natural."
