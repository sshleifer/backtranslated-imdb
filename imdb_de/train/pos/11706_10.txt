All reviewers on this page have to say that this movie is worth seeing. So it was done in 1972, so what? The fashion in the film was exactly the same fashion of his time. People who have not studied culture of decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series "Left Behind" (which was just made for our time) it looks happy. The only naughty part of the film, however, is the fashion that goes back more than 30 years. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully preserved. There's just so much to say, but I refuse to say it. (afraid to ruin it) So, go and watch this movie! If you do not like the message you send, you have problems that require some attention!
