Movie "comedies" are nowadays usually 100 minutes of toilet humor, bad language and baring excesses. Modern comedies address the lowest common denominator, the unpretentious and slow brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come, but it's getting rarer. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blanding's Buildings his Dream House" shows what Hollywood was capable of in the 1940s, and it's just weird. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows her story from house hunting, the seditious construction of the house to the finished home - with his "zuzz-zuzz water softener". For Grant and Loy, that's just what their roles are, of course (Grant is especially funny when he watches how the house costs get out of hand). However, the film is stolen by the wise lawyer of Blandings, who is played perfectly by Melvyn Douglas. Douglas manages to steal every scene he's in, and he's unobtrusively funny while watching the blandings collide from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the scared architect of the Blandings and Harry Shannon as the crusted old well drill are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times and always make me laugh. I think it's a good movie if you need a lift, whether you build a house or not.
