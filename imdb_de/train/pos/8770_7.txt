I meant that in a good way, believe me. Lifelike it is not. The whole Oirish thing gets kinda fat, but you enjoy the cast here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All right. I also liked Mike Mazurki - of course he played a boxer, what else? A typical 40s movie with familiar faces and fast scenes, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn is fine as a gentleman Jim, you never get a one-dimensional look at him or the rest over here, I think. But it's okay, it's a cartoon and you're supposed to like that, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Vaudeville Logging Act was an uprising, and you'd like to see all those Billyclub bobbies pop into the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Really fun, Flynn was on a roll at this time and it's clear to see why the audience loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
