This movie has no story. It's just a couple of guys torturing an innocent young girl to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> That's what they do: They beat them in a net and hang them inside like birdseeds, turn them around in a chair until they puke, make them sound loud pour boiling oil on them, insert worms into their wounds, squeeze their hand with a sledgehammer and finally put a needle through their eye. <br /> <br /> This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was a fake, I thought it was a snuff movie. Although I was disgusted by this movie, I really liked it. It scared me. I think it serves a purpose. I give a 10/10.
