Outstanding. I had originally thought that in the face of the communist inclination of Amrita Pritam and the nationalist bias film by Dr. Ing. Dwivedi will be more open-minded than novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised that it was the other way around for not pseudo-sec and for Dr. Dwivedi be objective. This film sensitively touches a sensitive topic. Victims of war are women, as a poet has said, and this film embodies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, as they can not stand against their girl's kidnappers or the Hindu brother who can only burn his tormentor's fields. On the other hand, it also shows economic aspects behind the division or, in fact, why girls were even kidnapped. I think kidnappers believed that the kidnapping of girls would make them the rightful owners of the houses and thus a new government. will not be able to ask them to return the houses. Apart from that, one must acknowledge the courage of the characters of Puro and their Bhabhi, they are two simple village girls who are unaware of the outside world, and risk anyone by trying to come back after a dishonor. Because there are many documented cases in which such women in India were not accepted by their families. No wonder a woman had to understand the pain of other women.
