"Kalifornia" is one of my absolute favorite movies and could easily be described as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind it are many disturbing and honest portrayals of killing maneuvers and the violent violence they inflict on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is its performance. Brad Pitt is amazingly great as a trailer trash psycho named Early. Pitt Potrays makes his frightening character almost flawless. Juliette Lewis is as good at playing his na√Øve friend, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "Kalifornia" has a very simple conspiracy that moves steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a harrowing murder as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are a lot of shocking scenes and it all depends on a powerhouse climax that will keep you tracked for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be seen, as it gives an intense view of the enormity of a human and not just violence and blood.
