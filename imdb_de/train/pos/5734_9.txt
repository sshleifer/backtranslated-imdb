I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, providing the audience with absolutely unique films with typical "lynch elements". After seeing most of his works, I thought naively that I could predict Lynch's next move. I was totally wrong Dumbland is something I could never have imagined under David Lynch. After recovering from the first shock, I began to think about this extremely primitive main character, and I concluded that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality, and disgust presented here reflect something of the reality that emphasizes distortion becomes. There are things in our lives that we hardly stress because they are either disgusting or terrible, but they surround us, so I take the courage to say Dumbland is focusing on those parts. This is not a movie you can enjoy, even if you sometimes laugh from a strange, perverted humor. This is an animated reflection of all the things we tend to reject, with their simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it the way it is, you do not have to like it. It just exists. And if you're alert enough, you'll also find Lynch-typical elements. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
