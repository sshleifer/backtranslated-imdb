This show has all the typical characters of a comedy: the good, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's set for the 70s. That's the only difference that exists in other television comedies. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you." (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez, you're a pervert. (Audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (Audience cheers and applauds) "That's not funny. I think if these laughs did not exist (I do not know what you call English, sorry), you would not laugh at all. This is not an intelligent comedy, it is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but that's not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my bad english again.)
