STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A remarkably bad actor coping with his (now fading) looks Richard Gere has been in the American Hollywood scene has always taken a rather curious position, as a strong bet on leadership roles, which plays a remarkable role to this day. Nowadays, however, he seems to have been more concerned with these direct DVD releases and limited release roles, and as such he now seems to feel more in his fear. <br /> <br /> He has to rely on a strict case here As a hardened, cynical case-hander Earl Babbage, such a worker has given to a few hundred sex offenders in a US area, along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) to focus on his latest case to deal with the abduction from the Internet A young woman trying to apologize for a case he had failed to do for ages. <br /> <br /> This is a certain entry into the dark side of humanity that comes across material, definitely not for the squeamish or those who are looking for light. And as such, it's a pretty strong, captivating movie that is relentless and not constrained by the direct DVD budget. The only thing that really pulls him back is the overused, jerky, fast-paced camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that seem a bit hackneyed after a while. But it's still one of the most stable materials I've seen in Gere. It is becoming relentlessly darker and more than ever before. ***
