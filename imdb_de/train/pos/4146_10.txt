Anyone who has experienced the Age of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "Spring Break Movie" AND it makes fun of the college film genre. It's funny, there's a cast to die for (Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posey, Jane Lynch, Amber Tamblyn, Missi Pyle!). The author / actress Rachel Dratch is a weird genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OH MY GOD! (I'm repeating myself ...) It will continue to live with girls who like Miranda July but want to eat ice cream and pretend they are stupid.
