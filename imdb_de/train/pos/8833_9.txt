I was intrigued by the title, so I stayed up during a little sleeplessness (fueled by my curiosity ...) and watched. I then checked my TV listings and viewed again! It's a very obvious realization that came to my mind when watching this movie - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers are the same everywhere. The characters of the children from Belgrade could have been transported to the American Midwest during the same period, and language differences aside would hardly be distinguishable from the native youth of that time. They certainly showed the same growing pains and worries that politics set aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... in fact, it was exactly the same things that made my time in Southern California the 1970s <br /> <br /> This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely credible. I can not say that this was the Yugoslav "American Graffiti", but I will say that it fits well with other films of the 50s.
