- SMALL SPOILER IN! - <br /> <br /> When I saw the voices for "Creep" today, I was surprised that so many IMDb users rated this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from such films? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's a pretty good movie! This automatically means: It has an absurd story of holes, outrageous dangers, and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat, and enjoy the fear of being scared to death. The first 60 minutes, when there is nothing but Kate and a lonely subway station, are incredibly scary. There is tension and anxiety in every corner of the screen, and you'll get some jerks just because a flashing neon lamp suddenly sounds in your back. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the movie goes down, but it's still not going to be a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the Gore effects are well done and the story is pretty well developed. (... as long as you remember that this is a horror movie and not the Discovery Channel!) If you want to make a very, very scary hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and leave the cinema or turn off the TV. You know the rest of the story, right? The villain will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until its end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to take the fear to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema in the dark night, go to the next U -Bahnstation and take the last train home ...
