It's great how this movie gets you. I had honest laughs. I do not care that the budget is low because the thing works for me. To be honest, my wife did not really do that, but she prefers another movie. However, she admitted that it was very creative and well put together and probably everything was on a shoelace. These characters, whose lives are strange and restless, give me something to relate to in my own world. Just keep going and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. When I saw this movie a second and third time, I realized that there were some hidden moments that passed me the first time around. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway, it was nice. Hope to see more.
