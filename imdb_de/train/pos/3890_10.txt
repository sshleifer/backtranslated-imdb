This is a great stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for good conversations with others who have seen it. I highly recommend this hotel. The part about Europe's history is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are pretty good, because you do not have to speak French to get them (though, it's funny anyway). Also, the aspects of being transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. Skip the ones if you can. It's almost not worth looking at. However, this is really a fun, funny stand-up show everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
