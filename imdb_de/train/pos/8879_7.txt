*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems to be very overkill until I remind you that my college campus had a former Nazi racist killer who had committed suicide at the time Also: His name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> check Wikipedia - I added some photos to her article. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but this stuff really happens. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
