The time was not friendly to this movie. Once the controversial adaptation of the bestseller by Jeffrey Konvitz, this movie now looks like a mainstream version of your typical Spookfest. Apart from the terrible touches (especially the crazy, exaggerated finale), this is essentially a shiny horror movie for those people who are not interested in the genre. It has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the audience, not theirs average low-low movie (the producers of the 70s disaster movies had a similar idea). I like to see the familiar faces, but the story is very stupid, and no matter how high the movie it pretends to be, it's on par with an average 70's movie (not a bad thing). Nevertheless, it is a pleasing film, especially for spectators who like to stare. As always, Albert Whitlock's dull work is outstanding. All in all pretty entertaining.
