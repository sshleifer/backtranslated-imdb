Carol, the young girl in the middle of history, is transplanted to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the civil war in the late 1930s. Everything is new to this girl, in his strangeness. The war and her father are her constant worries as she plunges into a provincial culture years behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this movie based on the numbers. Carol's family is obviously divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an Air Force pilot with the left faction. The other sympathies of the family exist with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story does not add anything to what has been said, much better, but it's a simple movie to watch. The beautiful landscape of northern Spain is shown. Do not expect much action as most of what happens to Carol and the young guys she's friends with. Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who befriends Carol. Carmelo Gomez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left behind when she went to America. This actor, who normally starred in most Spanish films, has nothing to do because he remains a mystery throughout the movie.
