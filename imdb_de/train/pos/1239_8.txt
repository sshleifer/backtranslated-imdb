I think the movie was pretty good, after all this time I will add it to my "classic collection". I think I saw other posters that reminded some of the pickier people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points of "logic" oppose, but many religious things accepted "in faith" do not pass the smell test. If you want to accept whatever you believe, you can accept a movie. Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed, that the Aja Yee Dagger is the same knife that Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble gaining control of The Shadow? No mention of it in the trivia section for both movies here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar to a donut, it's the same prop.
