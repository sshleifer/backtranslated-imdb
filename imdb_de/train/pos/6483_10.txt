This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly marks the beginning of the Second World War. The origins of German failure by the Treaty of Versailles, which fueled Hitler's demonic rise, have not been fully investigated, but as a reviewer says, this must be hard to do, in a 26-part series that has so much to do. <br /> <br /> Apart from the expected combat photography / action, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that are said to give the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you are not necessarily a fan of World War II are. Episodes showing "testimonies" and life on the home front of the major Allies / Opponents, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States of America were quite enlightening. To show the extreme cruelty of the war at the front, and of course the sufferings of the civilian population, extermination camps, etc., were very well treated and exposed. I would fully recommend this in any history lesson for the younger generation (of whom one might say I'm one at 47!). Certain things are left out rather strangely, such as the advent of the new jet era with the experimental Gloster jet by Frank Whittle and the battle debut of the Gloster meteor and the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V-1 made its debut and the V2 surprisingly less was mentioned. This is probably a minor oversight and does not refer to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons World War II produced from a rather barren old science. But a great show that has made a difference and has done so ever since, gratefully repeating it. <br /> <br /> A series that should be historically a box, on DVD for anyone who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
