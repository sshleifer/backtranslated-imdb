This is the latest addition to a new wave of educational documentation such as The Corporation and Fahrenheit 9/11. His commentary is clear and unerring, as is the breathtaking style of this well-made feature. The film manages to convey a strong sense of how unstable our world is as we prepare ourselves for an environmentally friendly future at lightning speed - while showing the terrible beauty of our pursuit of progress. <br /> <br /> Truly a remarkable achievement that must be seen by all who care about the world we give to our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> NB - this is also the only film (of 8) in the varsity theaters (Toronto) that has an adhesive label marked .... "... another testament to the popularity and importance of this gemstone. <br /> <br /> My bet ... a nomination for an Oscar for Best Documentation. <br /> <br /> OB101
