Ang Lee obviously likes to get involved in a movie, catching action, figures, and attitudes on the hoof when they appear. This is an ideal approach to cover the random endgame of the American Civil War through the arbitrary actions of a young militia that has no sense or masculinity. The film is about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the central South as a silent figure, who endures the fight like a tough parent. James Schamus' script is probably the standard carrier of this film; Behind it are a number of well-equipped performances, which wear it admirably. Jeffrey Wright's name alone could carry this movie for me. He is brilliant, but in a slow burning role: Instead, we are offered by a large, often recognizable ensemble very good (if not revealing) performances. <br /> <br /> A classy, ​​optimistic movie. One that you should watch if you are not interested in the harder, bittersweet Cold Mountain or The Claim. 10.7
