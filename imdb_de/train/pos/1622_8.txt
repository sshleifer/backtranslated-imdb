I've just seen this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are from the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. It's true ... stereotypes are there, but that's how it was ... and these cartoons were meant to entertain adults in your local movie theater before the main feature. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising's cartoons tended to be "smarter" and more upscale (after all, we're talking about MGM) than the standardized animated short at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO, or Low Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had a lot of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him before he went to "Technicolor". Disney had some cartoons with cartoons of black entertainers ... Silly symphony "Woodland Cafe" of 1937. But we have to keep in mind that these films are part of a certain time and place. In 50 years, clips from the Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will be scrutinized, analyzed and even vilified by future viewers.
