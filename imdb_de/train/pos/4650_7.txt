As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the beautiful flight scenes of Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case an inactive rocket Rb 75 (Maverick), which is painted black and attached to the side of the letters "EWS 39" in white. Real Jammer pods definitely do not look that way, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing various Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, in the movie should see them here. <br /> <br />
