This is a really great and heartbreaking movie !!!! The places of Ripstein are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinary García Márquez, no doubt. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us excellent performance as Colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You have to see it !!!
