I just saw the movie, and the scary thing was, the people talking during the movie sounded the same as the actors. The film had its moments, but stayed behind and was pretty ill. It should all be a farce, but when you see the wretched life of the people in the movie, you think, "People like this are all around us." All attempts to gain the sympathy of the audience, are rejected by the actors stupid after another. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for a video - but it was a good laugh. WARNING- Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a nice sight!)
