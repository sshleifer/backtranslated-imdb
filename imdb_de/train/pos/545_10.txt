Continuations hardly do justice to the original. This is definitely true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, be sure to give it a watch. Although the camera is not enough, Brian Krause's character is annoying and the plot is a clique, she's a lot funnier than the first and I find that entertaining. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie with the same performance as in the first movie. Honestly, it's a bit different. Instead of sitting in his cabin and writing screenplays, Stanley goes to Hollywood to lead his dream project Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a very different feeling, but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give him a 6 out of 10 points.
