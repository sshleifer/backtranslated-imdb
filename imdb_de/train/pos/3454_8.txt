First of all, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fanatic obsessed with looking good, in fact I'm not even a big Justin fan, but I liked that movie. <br /> <br /> I'm working on a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never heard of, I had to see what it was about. I did not find Justin's acting so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that did not even make the first credits. The story is simple, a journalist revealing corrupt cop, but I thought it was well done. L L Cool J's character had clearly come into conflict, but I really did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is, as always, the wise mentor he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of there. His character did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not go wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought that Dylan McDermott showed the best performance as a homicide detective. Really believable and really in his character, he freaked me out a few times. <br /> <br /> I really expected a lot of cheesiness, to be honest. Terrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any of it. Every shoot had a point, it was not a clich√©, really pretty solid. <br /> <br /> All in all an amazing cast, a decent story that interested me and just enough action to make me jump. I do not know why it did not appear in the cinemas, it was better than any junk I saw on the big screen. I would say it is worth seeing.
