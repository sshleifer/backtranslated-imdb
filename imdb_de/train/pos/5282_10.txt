I do not know ... Maybe it's just an impressive homage to a Muslim religious action (Hajj), but I just felt that the movie was so underrated. I just can not believe that the movie was only chosen by 223 people so far, since the film was produced in 2004 and has since won many awards. About the movie ... this is one of those well-made, sweet actor movies.Reda, a French teenager who is said to be sitting for Baccalauréat, is asked by his pious older father to take him to Mecca. Strange, as it stands (if you do not know much about Islam), the father wants his son to drive them from their homeland in France to Saudi Arabia on a unique religious pilgrimage. The generational gap between the father and the son is based on simple conditions ("You can read and write, but you know nothing about life," the unnamed father of his son), but a kind of Bromine generation gap literature is avoided. Many of them are tender in their frustration. The father never speaks French, although Reda understands Arabic but seems to answer only in French. Although they meet a lot of people on the street: "There is the fearsome old woman they pick up on the Bosnian border on the way to Belgrade, and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian) who helps them on the Turkish border, the reserved and the ruthless shy women with burkas on the way to Damascus "The focus is always on the mismatched father and son. There is not much entertainment in the movie that makes it pleasing to your eyes. In every city you go to, you will see beautiful views. The director even shows you the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, even if the film is not relatively long. <br /> <br /> Generally I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogues and they have their power from the subtleties of the camera, but this one was really great. Despite some unanswered details (like Reda's unseen French girlfriend), the film appeals to the senses. Great artwork and remember this film is Ismaël Ferroukhis debut.
