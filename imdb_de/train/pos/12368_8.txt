I turned on the TV as a white noise companion and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment." I ran into the TV room and expected another 70's strip and got much more. Fortunately, I was able to rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to fully view it. (Cinemax uncut and no less in HD!) Apart from a few holes in the story and occasionally unlikely dialogues / events, this is an effective effect a thriller worthy of your time. At times quite scary and progressive: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played by Cristina Raines. Parker stabs an explicit scene in a trio scene in her dad's very bloody way (do not let the kids close.) Watch) The movie is about 70's full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascots) and decor, bad hair bloated music score and a familiar-looking cinematography. The cast is excellent. Take a moment to look at the homepage of this movie and have a look. It was a surprise that Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum were so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully scary! ENJOY!
