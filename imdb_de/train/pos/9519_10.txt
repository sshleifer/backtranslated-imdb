Tom Hanks has starred in such successful films as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good people to cheer on. In Road to Perdition his character Michael Sullivan is a bit different. <br /> <br /> In Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition film, based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, he shows the story of a man and his son during the Great Depression in Chicago. The special thing about this little excursion is that Sullivan is a hit man, who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or ex-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) almost loves him more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After a wrong job because of Connor, the only witness to his mistake, are Sullivan and his son, who should not be there. So Connor tries to turn off Sullivan and his family, but gets only the wife and the other son Peter. Sullivan outwits the hit and hurries home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table. Since his wife and child are dead, Sullivan goes to the streets to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to get things done right in memory of his wife and child, and for Michael, he feels like he's to blame for all of this. He feels that his curiosity has killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a great job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of youthfulness. His loss of innocence has been well done as he travels from city to city leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> Mendes' last film was American Beauty, which received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This movie was not nearly as good as winning the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and receiving five other nominations for music, sound and a Best Actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story that takes you on a journey through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: Husband, Killer and Devoted Father. This movie is a sleeper movie that should be seen for years to come.
