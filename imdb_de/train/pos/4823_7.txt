It's a tricky thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and authoritative, on the other hand, she has to show vulnerability in a difficult situation and gather courage and determination to overcome the odds, since almost all movies about queens have this baseline. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt radiates like Victoria, but not as full as I would like, no blame for her. I can not help but feel that this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth. So Blunt can not handle the range of royal feelings, at least not in full, since she's the young Victoria, you know. To see old Victoria, look at Mrs. Brown. Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting director for the film. He last did C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and made him famous. It was a completely different movie, but I remember it looked beautiful and that's probably the main resemblance between the two films. However, while Vallee C.R.A.Z.Y. This was from Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story was less interesting for this film. I soon got lost in all government policy. Maybe it was less appealing because the monarchy could not be beheaded. I'm only saying yes.
