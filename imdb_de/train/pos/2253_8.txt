I rented this movie because I'm interested in American history, and especially in the strange story of the Mormons. This film seeks to find out how Joseph Smith transformed his "vision" into a world religion. It first focuses on the problems the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. It shows the trial of Joseph Smith. In the process, Brigham Young stands up to speak of his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is murdered and Young has to deal with his own doubts as to whether he has been selected to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he insists and eventually has a vision (Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, when the crops are destroyed by the crickets, he doubts again that he was really selected - but a miracle does happen that consolidates his place in history. The story should be convincing and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons believe that this is an accurate account. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not addressed. The topic is not underlined. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people will stay away from this movie because of their religious theme, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest consistently.
