It all started with True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse to bring the club to safety. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and takes her to see True Heart Bear. Later, the caregiver went back further and True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse should check if it is Dark Heart. However, they can not go unless the club cares, so ask Dawn & John to look after the club. After returning True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse, they send Dawn & John back to camp. Then the bears of the clubs and cousins ​​are grown and prepare for the fight against Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart kidnaps all the troubled bears and the kids (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. Then they work together to save the Care Bears. Later, True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse found a dark heart shadow and returned to the nursing home to find that they had disappeared. The kids (Dawn, John, & Christy) are coming, but they were not strong enough to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse help Dawn, John, and Christy free the other foster bears, but Christy got in the way and was hit by Dark Heart magic. Than Dark Heart saw Christy beaten and stopped fighting the keeper to help her, but he can not, because Dark Heart (himself) does not have the power to save Christy. The care bears and the kids help Dark Heart save Christy. Now Dark Heart started to care and became a real boy to fall in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy train in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a great step and the best Care Bears movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I Like all Care Bears movies and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
