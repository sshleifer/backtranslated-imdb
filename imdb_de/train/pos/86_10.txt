I remember seeing this in a Salem movie theater (where I visited "Kiddie Matinees" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a little boy and never forgot it. It just thrilled me and my friends. I wish I could somehow see it again! I tried to find a compilation of shorts or something without success. I've just discovered that it's a Cousteau movie, and it got me even more excited. How damned he did that is beyond my comprehension. The fish is indeed actually in the cat's mouth, if I remember correctly! If someone could help me find a way to see it again, I would be extremely grateful!
