In my experience of Finland for a little over a week, I would say that this film is very accurate in the nature of Finnish society. I am particularly familiar with the phenomenon of a young couple having a baby who is having serious problems, since I have experienced exactly the same thing in Finland. The relationships and problems of the people, the fragility of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, the unemployment and the rising money problem are all very good, without subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points in movies that are not necessarily easy to understand and tie together, but the big picture is still rewarding. Not every short story is exciting or profound, but as I said before, the big picture does not fail to convey the sense of "real life" and captivate the viewer. I think in a quiet moment: What happens in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what happens. Movies like these are good to promote your imagination. It could be assumed that this film could be considered as life in many countries, but it is particularly reflective of Finland and is damn good. <br /> <br /> A Commentary on Acting: The Fan of Finnish Cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors in another film, but I found the acting in this feature next door perfect. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good attempt by the entire crew. I will keep an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
