I think I'm a bit connoisseur of boxing films and so there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing film ever made. This is the Robert Wise / Paul Newman strip "Somebody up there likes me". The movie might be Number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. <br /> <br /> The film not only documents the rise of James J. Corbett, but also shows boxing at a crucial transitional period. In the late 1800s, boxing moved from the brutal days of mere ankle rules to the "gentlemanly" days of the gloved rules established by the Marquis of Queensbury. And the sport moved away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle to a time of acceptance and seriousness. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at these days. It's romantic and yes, sometimes even hokey. But always wonderful. Errol Flynn is perfect as a "gentleman" Jim, who is not actually a "gentleman", but just a quick spokesman from a working class family. Alexis Smith, as the upper-class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship, is pretty gorgeous (and we all know that it's love, of course, that will win the game in the end). <br /> <br /> At the end of "Gentleman Jim", the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line is NOT "I can lick every man in the world" of course ... romance again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This really is one of the best scenes in all sports ever made. Realistic? No, but wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, look instead for "Raging Bull." This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
