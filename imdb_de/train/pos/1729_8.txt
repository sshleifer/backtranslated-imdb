In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to flee from a prisoner of war camp with a turnpike in the yard. In 1950, it was decided to film his report, and a peculiar British film genre began - the story of the Military Prison Camp - which reached its peak in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady story eventually becomes a climax, with more suspense because the story does not give way to improbable drama, jump cuts, or pompous music. It is absolutely contemporary and works wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a strangely restrained cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. All are invariably constantly monotone and quiet. They keep the emotions out of their roles. Since so many were in ex-service until recently, I suspect they were reviving their role as 'officers and gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> This emotionless approach does not reduce dramatic tensions. By contrast, unlike most Wartime escapes, the story does not end at the barbed wire, and that fact alone keeps me stuck.
