As an aging rocker, this movie mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands of all time - but with the incredible cast (everyone) - and the fantastic storyline - I love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it any higher - and Mick Jones added so much (Foreigner Lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer of all time - Lou Gramm) - I've seen this great work more than ten times Jimmy Nail's talent spills out of every pore - then Astrid ... and Karen ..... what could an aging rocker ask for more !! 10/10 - damn awesome. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Originally from Windsor, England.
