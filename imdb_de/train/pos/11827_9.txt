If Dick Tracy were in black and white, the pope would not be religious. We're giving a new meaning to the concept of color in a movie and providing a unique experience in a comic world, and it's one of the few films that has made it possible, thanks to a serious script, good direction and outstanding performance (Al Pacino is amazing) and above all a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. If you use only base colors, the experience is different from everything we've seen so far. And there is also a rather successful tribute to all gangster movie genres that have practically died out of modern cinema. Overall, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality for a cinema that relies more and more on the old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
