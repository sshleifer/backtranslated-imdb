Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the real ones - the Noir movies of the 1940s - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us who yearn for the past. The term "neo-noir" has been misused so often in the past decade that it has lost meaning and effect. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserves to be labeled as such. The casting is perfect all around and would have made Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur feel at home. The plot is so tight that you are addicted to the first 15 minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated it. Many contemporary films ask me why they do not do it the way they used to, and I'm not even that old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.
