To be honest, I did not like this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I think the problem is that I did not see it in a theater. Big mistake ! Because the most important thing in Cliffhanger is the attitude and number 2 is the cinematography. Try watching this movie on the largest possible TV and great sound system. The music is good and brings the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy knows about action. The Hard 2, The long kiss goodbye etc and it's especially good in this movie. The special effects are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the movie to be successful again. Still good to see him!
