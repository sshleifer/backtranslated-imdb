I did not expect the highest caliber of filmmaking, with Joel Schumacher as the director, and I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the art, it's often a derivative of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with shaky camera work, grainy shots, the film occasionally ran like a sprocket. All these techniques Speilberg used to make his film more realistic, however, were more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not so weak, as the characters in this movie looked more like real people and the story was less invented, not so much in the American flag (Speilberg gets a 'F') 'in subtlety). <br /> <br /> In addition to the first section of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp I've seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
