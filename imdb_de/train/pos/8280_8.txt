George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a secluded cabin in upstate New York when their car meets a deer and deviates into a ditch becomes reality and a carnivorous ghost, half-animal and half-man Wendigo, lives in a small town .. "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often lays in a bleak family drama. The characters are well developed and there are some sizzling moments. Wendigo's subtle looks are handled effectively and it's never clear what's real and what's imaginable, or if the story plays completely in Miles's head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden and certainly will not be the last. Give this film a chance if you do not mind seeing something unconventional.8 out of 10.
