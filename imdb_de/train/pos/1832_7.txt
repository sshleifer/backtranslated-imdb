I saw two films at the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other was "Waqt". Both films are shot in "Bollywood" but are worlds apart. The basic difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible impression with "Ankhen", one of the best comedy-Hindi films. His casting of the Charecteres is perfect. The story, which seems to have been taken from a Gujerati game, is great, treatment is excellent with a few exceptions. In Bollywood, when a movie is put together, a Bollywood director tends to sign a music director first, and this guy (in this case the mediocre Malik) is required to push six songs to fulfill his contract. Therefore, even a good director like Vipul Shah has to placate the finishers and grandmas who are not getting enough of those numbers. No music director can relentlessly produce good songs, as can clearly be seen in this film. None of the songs has any melody and they are clearly intervening in the story's tale except for the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat-Natyam. The dueling and role-playing game of father and son is a good acting art by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he's ready to wait until there's a good story going on in this super movie. Then we have a cheap, classless, tasteless producer like Sharukh Khan, who leans low to shamelessly accumulate and promote a waste like "Kaal" to enrich himself at the expense of art improvement before the word gets around. These are the Bollywood Locusts aiming to award Bollywood Chamchas the "Bollywood Chamcha" prizes, and most of them are in the media.
