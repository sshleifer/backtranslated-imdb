In what is probably on my list of Fuller's best films (that is, as soon as I see more of them and only Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a film noir in which the Femme Fatale and the male protagonist are are not the stereotypes in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually lacking in the Hollywood Noirs. With a small budget - at least for people like Darryl F. Zanuck-Fuller - and his actors, they create personas who are sympathetic even in such a dark atmosphere. The good guys are basically those who do not become violent, even if they are looking for extra money. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are great in the lead roles. Widmark is just one of a few actors who could really take that character from me. He's a bit like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise ass that's a bit sneaky. On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy has a number of values ​​in his life. He does not engage in the affairs of other people and does not care about the world of work outside of his small hut by the river after being sent away for three years. He slips, unknowingly, to himself as he steals a woman (Peters) in the train and lifts an object that is under the eyes of the government. It can have some secrets that could bring him a lot of money. But at what price is the heart of the film, as it includes Stoolie Moe (Knight is one of the best and most credible character actors of that time), the woman's ex (a fugitive Kiley), and the police department. <br /> Apart from the thematic elements that are told in a dramatic, journalistic style (like Fuller's position next to Boxer), the dialogue is fresh and intoxicating. In many camera movements of Fuller there is a spontaneity. And what a third act. This is a slim, tight film noir that is well worth exploring, even if you're unfamiliar with Fuller (comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works).
