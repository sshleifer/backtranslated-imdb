I had an uncle who, after serving in Vietnam, had been killed because of spiritual problems he had experienced on his return. When I saw a part of this movie on a pay-for-view channel one evening, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and how he prepared for Vietnam. I took off and rented this movie, and I have to say, it's the most crushing movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after the rental. I have never seen the way in which you move so emotionally in so many different ways with another film. As for Vietnam movies, I think it's the best, though Platoon is just behind him. Apart from all that, I think it's also Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his films, but in this he was incredible. I rated this as 10 because it's one of my five favorite movies.
