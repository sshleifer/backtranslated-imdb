This movie is an interesting version of the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to grow larger than the sum of its parts. Average montage scenes, 30-year-old teenagers and some great facial expressions are becoming a "new wave" of modern classics. As a spectator, I left the movie with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when I saw The Godfather in 1969 for the first time. Tiffany Gardner's startling portrayal of morally bankrupt Judy was earning her Grammy nomination, which was well documented by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels could match the expectations of the original (unlike the Godfather series, which got better with each installment and was set to peak in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage).
