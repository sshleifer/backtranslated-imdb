Call me teen, but I really think this is a great show. If you have not had the opportunity to experience some episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely check them out. Perhaps more convincing than Voyager's Caretaker, who started the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are totally different and yet strangely familiar ... The music is catchy as well. No real sci-fi fan can see at least one Star Trek episode - and those rates make the wait worthwhile.
