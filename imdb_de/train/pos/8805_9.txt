A patchwork around 911. The 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (for example, the first), and sometimes to tell the Americans, "We've had more deaths than you and you supported the killers." sometimes very strange (but highly symbolic and interesting). I was really excited about Claude Lelouch (personal life of a couple in New York showing that our everyday "problems" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, generally strongly anti-war) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny) I am very pleased that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they? I am still Belgian but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and are able to challenge our government's past and present actions, as we do should do in a democracy.
