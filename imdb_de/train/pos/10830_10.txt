I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any other movie I've seen in years. A successful band from the 70s decides to try again. They start with some gigs in crazy European locations, with amazing results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are great. The characters are just right, especially the singer with the heavy metal voice, make-up and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Take a look at it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
