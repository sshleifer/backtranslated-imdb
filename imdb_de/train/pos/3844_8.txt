If you read the synopsis of this movie, you may think it's a strange movie, and in a sense, it's the main character of the film, where Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is followed by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle clues as to what goes on with the story, and it's great fun for the viewer to find out the symbology used in the movie. Despite the use of imagery and some hints towards the end of the movie, the movie remains very exciting and will not get boring for a minute. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great alignment of the whole by Paul Verhoeven. His directing style is clearly visible and you can say from different points of view that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only will it be typical of people who are familiar with its American films due to the nudity and graphics of violent scenes, it will also be typical of people who are familiar with its Dutch films because of the same things and its talent, to tell a great story. If people watch Verhoeven's American films, shortsighted people may say he has no talent for telling a good story, and only focuses on blood and sex. That's what some people think, while I think he's a very talented director, trying to convey a deeper message with each film. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example of Verhoeven's ability to do more than science fiction splatter movies. Maybe companies should trust him more and offer him different films. He needs that. Just look at his Dutch films. They not only show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but also that he has a remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him a step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
