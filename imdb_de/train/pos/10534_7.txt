Whether it's a good movie or not, I think films of this kind need to be made. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees," an overwhelming and puzzling film in which Isabelle Huppert is soaked in a sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!) by a young American in a mud pond. I hope the director will continue crossing the border, as if I was not always subtle about the decisions Vincenzo Natali made (some scenes were unfortunately a kind of "tarte à la crème", like a childish slapstick) , to talk about script and cinematography? The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, happier and more surprising than Natali's earlier films.
