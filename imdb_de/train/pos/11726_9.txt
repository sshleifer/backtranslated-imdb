When my sister said that this movie would be good, I had second thoughts, but I looked at him and it was really funny. Basically, the movie is made by a weird girl who goes to a small town where she does not like anyone and just wants to go there to get her aunts reading so she can go. but it's not that easy. In this movie you'll find hilarious humor, a witch, a book of spells / repetitions, a mentally retarded uncle and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak. I hope you run out immediately and try to find this really old movie. I hope you like it all in all. I have to give it a 0 No, I'm just kidding. Give a 9.> <br /> love yours sincerely: Dakota can you send me an email at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you want
