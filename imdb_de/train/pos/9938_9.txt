We bought the DVD set "Once upon a time" (German) for our bilingual children because everyone loved the "Once upon a time man" (/). Once upon a time ... Man "series (we parents had seen it as children) and it even exceeded the high expectations! The series is very well done, does not show her age and our children of different ages see it At the same time they learn things that we parents have come to know later, the series covers everything that has to do with the human body, organs, all senses, blood, infections, antibodies and much more in animated 20-25 Minutes Episodes: Subjects that some people perceive as "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are treated in a tasteful, discreet, and child-friendly manner (the reproductive sequence mainly begins where the baby begins to grow) while it is (as usual) is informative and fun. <br /> <br /> Children tend to be intrigued by the way their bodies work and gain an understanding of them in the context of their environment through the episodes. The format of the episodes alternates between the outside world (a family with 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode dealing with infections, the boy accidentally cuts himself off and the wound becomes infected, and the episode describes how the body reacts to it. Similarly, the episodes on the senses, eg. Listening, seeing, linking what happens in the body to the context of the outside world and the episode about respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the entire life cycle, including (in short) the origin of oxygen (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best kids programs of all time - I would say it is a must for any family with children!
