For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "smaller" films from his later career. And although it's not a great movie compared to many of his other pictures, he's not bad and a decent passer-by-but not much else. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a Witch In New York City she inexplicably decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy so he falls in love with her. Over time, the cold and distanced woman Novak falls in love with Stewart - and apparently the witch's rulebook is definitely NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its feelings for the witches. They are neither the baby sacrifice nor the almighty variety. Most of their magic is quite limited and meaningless (like Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lights). Oddly enough, the witches seem to be bohemians in trendy bars, where you can find people wearing berets and listening to lousy jazz. Considering what I think of jazz, it really has to stink to be a witch in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty romantic and mild comedy anyway, but nothing I wanted to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the script does not provide enough profit to make this movie an extraordinary movie - I almost rated the movie at 6 - it was really close.
