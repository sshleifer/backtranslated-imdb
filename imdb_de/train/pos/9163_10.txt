When my daughter was in pre-school college age, this miniseries appeared every morning from 8 am to 9 pm on A & E. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss a minute Jane Eyre, and our kids were the one Every morning, too late in the preschool every morning. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten how much I loved this movie until I recently got my old VHS copy out. Timothy Dalton is very handsome but also perfect as a Rochester. The dark, jagged face, the stately manners softened by humor and tenderness, corresponded to the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a small backdrop, I could not keep myself in the lead role by adapting to William Hurt or the grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and engage in romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She is dead as Jane, calm, formal and says volumes at a glance. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse into the power and temperamental nature that has helped Jane to survive the ill-treatment she suffered in youth. Criticism of their performance as "wood" is missed. A servant in a real English household would have maintained such behavior, but she speaks passionately when overwhelmed by emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she seems to be easy enough to be Jane, but she is pretty enough to give the audience the opportunity to buy Rochester's attraction for them from intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and low intensity. Although Jane is as simple and sweet as custard, she refuses to be intimidated by the dark, stormy Rochester. The two leads are playing beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel.
