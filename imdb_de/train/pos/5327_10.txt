As a knowledgeable fan, I recommend this movie as being well and well traded. When I was 11 years old and living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talk about a new sense of music that made girls scream. I thought, hmmmm, if girls like them, they have to be crap. Until then, my only records were Haley Mills, the Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Soon after a vacation with my family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned, "Love Me Do"), and was exhausted by the difference between this and every song I had heard before. When I heard my older brother's "Meet The Beatles" album, I was thrilled for a lifetime. After reading the definitive book about their beginnings (by Davis), I was surprised that this film followed the facts very well, except for the fact that he omitted most of the sex and part of the drug (he touched on the use from methadrine / dexadrine). >
