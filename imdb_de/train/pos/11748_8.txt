Stumble over. First of all, I was a bit disappointed in the first episodes, but as I trusted the show and Abe Forsythe's indisputable talent, I kept watching. I can safely say that I'm glad I did it now. The story has developed pretty well and all the characters have a strong base, and most lack information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can complain about this production is the slightly annoying voice and pronunciation obsessed with the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good plays, coupled with a stellar storyline, really bring this show on the line. We hope for another season!
