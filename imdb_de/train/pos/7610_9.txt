Only seen Season 1 so far, but that's great! A large number of people were stuck on an island. No one is who they seem to be, and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their cabinets. But it's probably not a spoon full of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and an island that's everything you've ever dreamed of - in your craziest nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has so many twists and turns, it's incredible. Great setup, solid action with a liberating assumption that in the end all people (well, almost all ... I think ...) are with good and bad sides. But strange oh so funny ...
