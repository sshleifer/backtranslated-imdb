Of all British imperialist films such as Four Feathers, for example Charge of the Light Brigade, this film is the best choice. It reflects a time when "the sun never set in the British Empire". Get over it. I will not go into more detail because so many others have expressed the many reasons that make this movie great. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the pass through which the British marched, and it remains as it was, unchanged from the time and the intervention of humans and vandals. And even though I know it's coming, Din is seen lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> You are Lazarushian -Leather Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Even though I've strapped and skinned you, <br /> <br /> The living Gawd you're made of, <br /> <br /> Better than I am, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I am still foggy at the age of 54 and anyone who says they do not, is a liar. The range of emotions is the hallmark of a big movie. Like the end of another big movie, Of Mice and Men.
