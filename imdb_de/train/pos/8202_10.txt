This was undoubtedly the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening credits you are swept in a revenge story that hits hard and is deeply captivating. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman seeking revenge. Eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the storyline, but show Harry at his best. Full of memorable characters in smaller roles, this movie rocks and should serve as the standard for detective / action flicks. This is the Dirty Harry movie that is raw and free of lint. I can see that over and over again (okay, not in a session) because it's a pleasing yarn for Revenge. The pace is fast and some of the scenes are unforgettable. "Keep going - make me the day ... you feel happy, punk? ...," the classic Eastwood, just like Eastwood, can do with his awkward, rubbery expressions and his whispering, threatening voice.
