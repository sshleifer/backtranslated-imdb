I strongly recommend this movie. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who is wrongfully convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a boys' prison. There he is forced to dig 5 foot deep holes and 5 feet in diameter. There he meets the other boys of the camp (zero, magnet, armpit, squid, x-ray and ZigZag). Everyone digs not to "build character" but to find Kate Barlow's treasure. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about the Lochgraben. I give this movie a 9.5 because I'm very choosy about books on movies (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY). But it still worked well.
