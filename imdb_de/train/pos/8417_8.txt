While the style of this film is not as unobtrusive and realistic as it would likely have been for a sound version, it's still a very good movie. In fact, he was considered an outstanding movie in his time, being nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (defeat to WINGS). I still think WINGS is a superior movie, but this movie is excellent, though Emil Jannings played a bit over the top. Jannings is a general from Czarist Russia, who spent his last days in the 1920s earning a few dollars by being a Hollywood extra. His fortune seems to have changed when he receives a casting call - to play an imperial-Russian general who fights the communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not exactly a kind of stretching, but it also makes the old man think about the old times and the revolution. Exactly what happens next is up to you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Despite making it in 1928, he does not look much younger in make-up than in many of his later films.
