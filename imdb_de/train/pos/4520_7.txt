Too long and over the top, this comedy is a most adorable, never condescending or ridiculous look at the problems of a "power man" who likes to wear women's clothes in the evening. Julie Walters is as always lovely, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely believable and steals the movie. He is absolutely great in high heels and silk stockings.
