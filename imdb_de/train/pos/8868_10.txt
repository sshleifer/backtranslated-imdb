I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the top 3 movies I've ever seen. It has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows what life can be like at university. There are 3 main stories, the skinheads, the African-Americans and the gays. I was fascinated by all the stories, but the one that came to me the most was the story of Kristen fighting another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie more than 25 times, I still cry. I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to settle for 10/10.
