I saw the movie with a homophobic girlfriend, my wife and her friend. So I had views from all directions. Especially the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only conspicuous actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yeah, I think she played her part well, even if the script was not right. There were good Romanian actors, they just did not have complex roles. I welcome Puya entering the movie business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he's going to be a good actor. <br /> <br /> The woman, however, loved the movie, and I think that there could have been chords played and to which I had no ear. If the film tries to portray unusual sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania, then it has failed miserably. There were no consequences. Imagine, the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story just becomes a boring, uninteresting act. I have no idea why she received all these BAFTA awards. In my book it should have received the award "Better luck next time". (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
