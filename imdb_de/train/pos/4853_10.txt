I have something for old black and white films of this kind, films by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially since these are my favorites. I recorded this movie on DVD because it had the same idea as Will Hay's "Oh Mr. Porter", one of the most beautiful comedies ever made. I just completed the movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie was finished at 12:45 pm). I think that films of this kind, which have to do with Ghost Trains, etc., are best viewed at night without light. This way you get more into the storyline and the night display works well with this movie. <br /> <br /> The one-liners of the movie seem a bit dated to some viewers, I think it depends on the audience. But they are not dated to me. I am 28 years old and even though I was not old enough when the movie was first released (though it was my dad). I still have a lot of credit for some of the old films of this kind. If you sit in the TV room with snacks and drinks, sit back and relax in the evening while watching these movies, not many things can make you feel like it get, surpass. It is an escape from reality for a while. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has a black mustache), who appears after a car accident about three quarters of the way through the film, and he is looking for a woman, whom he pursues to the station has been. This man was also featured in the Will Hay classic "The Ghost of St Michaels". I just thought, I would point out, if nobody noticed :). <br /> <br /> The standards of the film are very atmospheric. Outside the abandoned station, it looks good and as if there is no soul for miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very cozy when you look away from the rainstorm that is outside. I felt like I wanted to be in the movie with the cast. The atmosphere in this film is missing in many films. It keeps you addicted from the first moment until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In today's market we need more of this film type. But unfortunately one could look in favor of films with nudity and cursing and gross humor. This type of filmmaking (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr. Porter, etc.) is for me the golden age of cinema!
