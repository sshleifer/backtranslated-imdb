This is a movie that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and I'm glad he did! The mix of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a widowed middle-aged widow trying to sustain her lifestyle was a shout. Add to this mix the reality needed to actually breed the pot (these plants under the bushes would NOT make it without the TLC they received), and it's a really funny but touching movie. I laugh every time I conjure up the vision of all the bar guests sitting in sunglasses on sun loungers and counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my blood in Mendocino County, but the British definitely did it right !! 10/10
