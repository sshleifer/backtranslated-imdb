A wonderful movie with amazing scenes and talented actors like Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes you will see your eyes on the screen and just breathe in the atmosphere of the movie to wait and see what fate brings to the characters. In this film you leave your position as a normal audience, he takes you in, he makes you part of the story ... costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the district of Okiyas is cleverly built. It's definitely not very Akira Kurosawa, but there's still a lot of master craftsmanship, especially the stylistic narration that tells us that we are in a land of cinema that is a long way from hollywood flamboyance.
