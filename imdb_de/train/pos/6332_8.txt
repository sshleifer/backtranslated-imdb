This movie is good for watching TV. I like it because I'm a huge fan of disaster movies, even though this is a family movie. The accuracy of the film from the book is one and a half. They have the names of the characters correctly, but there was no storm hunter in the book. The car scene in which the Hatch family escaped from the tornado was not in the book Participants Dan Luke and his friend, who rode with a police officer on the way to the police station for safety. and in the book, Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. That's all I can think about. All in all, this was a good movie, although it could have been a bit more accurate with the book. Did you know that the book is based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that devastated a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
