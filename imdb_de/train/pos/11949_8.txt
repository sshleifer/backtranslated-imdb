Woody Allen's second film in London. The Tarot card killer kills prostitutes in London. The aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a hint that he could be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to love him, but falls in love quickly. She was supported by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like that better than the overrated "Match Point" from last year. It was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old, but I was entertaining and let me guess until the end. It's not really a comedy, but it's a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (of course, Allen's). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's far better than its worst. <br /> <br /> The acting is for the most part very good. Allen is bad, but he has played this character a million times already and it got boring. But Johansson and Jackman are just great - they look awesome and offer two very responsive, credible services. Allen works (surprisingly) on her sex appeal - there is a sequence in which both show their beautiful bodies in their bathing suits. The only downside is that Allen is still unsure how to shoot London. He is not as choppy as on "Match Point" - maybe he gets better with time. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing. I give an 8.
