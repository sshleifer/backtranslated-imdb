After watching the rather sloppy World War I espionage thriller Madame Lili (1969) with Julie Andrews on television this afternoon, I suddenly thought I had seen a far superior World War I espionage thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a short search in IMDB to find Miss Doctor. When I recognized the title, the memories came back. It's a pretty well-made story at this time, revolving around true events like the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918. It also has a female spy who is much more credible than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memories of the well-produced battle scenes as well as men and horses in gas masks. If you are interested in war films, and especially World War I, it is a film that will win you over if you have the opportunity.
