Level adjustments often have a big mistake. They often look like a movie camera is simply put on stage (like "Night Mother"). The director of Sidney Lumet keeps the movie alive, which is especially difficult as the picture was not a real challenge. Still, it's nice to see what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of the few chances to really do it. <br /> <br /> I admit that I've never seen Ira Levin's game, but I've heard that Jay Presson is faithful to Allen's adaptation. The script is incredibly complicated and lets you guess. "Deathtrap" is a hugely entertaining movie and is recommended for almost all stage and screen fans. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
