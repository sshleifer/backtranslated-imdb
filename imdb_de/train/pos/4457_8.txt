Yes, this is one of the great musical films I grew up with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the graceful and beautiful voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and the dance are outstanding. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly. and Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse, which is unique for this time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's underrated stars. I have seen this again on A & E TV and have it in my old VCR tapes. Never tire of this old musical. What happened to Hollywood?
