In a time when Hollywood makes money with weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, this film comes to mind, reminding us of the concept of "Indomitable Spirit." If you feel depressed, this movie will free your mind and drive you higher. We all know how hard life can be. Sometimes we need to be reminded that perseverance and courage are going through us. That's what this movie did for me, and I hope it's for you.
