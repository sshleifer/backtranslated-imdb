Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, make a final trip to Thailand before they split up and go to college. It seems like a fun time traveling an exotic country until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into traveling to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They are verbally abused by local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from US justice. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of "Brokedown Palace" and it was a good one. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of Third World nations. Actually, the presentation was rather mild, since the prison conditions are often far worse than shown. It recalls that no matter how badly we think our judiciary is flawless compared to many other parts of the world. Unfortunately there were too many constructed situations in the movie that handicapped the story. The whole escape attempt was a fantasy. If you believe that friends could smuggle money into the jail for a bribe with a padded bra and could not be detected by the guards who systematically expose everything that was brought in by visitors, then it is believed that either the guards or the viewers are absolute blockheads. <br /> <br /> The story also fails to end the nagging question of how the drugs got into Alice's backpack (Claire Danes). Did she agree to transport the drugs? We can only guess. It was fascinating to keep guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the movie, but we end the movie without really knowing if one or both girls are guilty. Apart from this significant mistake, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> The acting of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. The oversold and overheated Danes actually arrived as actors in this movie. Although her portrayal was often immature (as was her character), she improved as the movie progressed and circumstances became gloomier. Beckinsale, on the other hand, flew her entire short career under the radar and shines as the two good shoes that are suddenly in jail. Her was the best performance in the movie. Bill Pullman was a lawyer miscast. His ironic and diffuse style is a benefit in films like "While You Slept," but as a lawyer in a Third World country that has freed two innocent girls from wrongdoing, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br The tourist's look on Thailand was interesting, but I did not want to go there. <br /> <br /> All in all, an entertaining movie was partially implausible by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10.
