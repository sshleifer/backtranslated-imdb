Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mysterious horror movie by Brian De Palma and really works. The atmosphere is right there. The atmosphere that scares you. And that's not what a horror movie should do. All actor Michael Caine is perfect as a dr. Robert Elliott shrinking with a little secret. Angel Dickinson as Kate Miller, the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific. Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant. Nancy Allen as Liz Blake, the call girl, is awesome. Tennis Franz plays his typical detective role. His detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie. There are many scary scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them comparisons between this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both of these films can cause sleepless nights.
