(WARNING: smaller spoilers) <br /> <br /> I hit this one side and looked from there, not knowing what it was or what the conspiracy was. It certainly caught my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy with whom she did the dirty act looked like a seriously nice guy who had just turned his head on a mean girl; I have to question how realistic this representation is. Anyone who would murder a man and a woman while asleep can not be very nice. Nevertheless, I had some sympathy for him, since he had been set up and exploited. So much was clarified. <br /> <br /> My main complaint concerns the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before the end, it did not seem possible to discover the truth. The way it was discovered was a "prank operation," but my question is, how was the police convinced to handle it? The film did not show that to us, and it seemed a bit too comfortable not to explain how to persuade them to do so. The omission of the explanation gave the crucial scene a tension that otherwise would not have been there (we already knew what the scene was about and what was going on with Brad). Otherwise this is a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested in finding out the facts of the real case. <br /> <br /> One more thing: the movie was shot in 1996. Some of the reviews here treat him as a newer movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I had never seen her before. She can also act a bit (always a plus in her work, LOL).
