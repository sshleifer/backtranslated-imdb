I've shown this film several times here at college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me grows exponentially ... In addition to the virgins, everyone I've shown it to has the desire to see him again. It takes a while to get in, but in the end he screams, shouts, screams, repeats scenes repeatedly, repeats dialogues, and is completely entangled in the Pia Zadora experience in "The Lonely Lady"! Scene by scene by scene scene of the most inappropriately filmed, poorly written, terribly restrained trash is thrown at you in a pervasive attack that is considered the coldest thing I own (no small statement, friends) .For me, nothing compares 2 U, Pia. .. and I do not think I'm the only one who has ever felt that way!
