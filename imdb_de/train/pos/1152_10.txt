The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's dizzying spirits is enough reason to enjoy the movie, but wait! There is more! This is a crackling good broadcast of daytime television, the movie stars on the way down (and up) and the horror of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the brighter side of his genius and Cathy Moriarty is great. The dialogue is funny and the physical humor is executed with perfect skill. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really like the art of acting, directing and writing.
