A mean, ugly, evil retro-action thriller about a bodyguard who's determined to find (and destroy) the girl's killers that he should protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott does not feel like apologizing for the inherent immorality of the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either unaware or does not care about 30 years of social progress. I really do not think we're going to see a more violent movie in the near future, so watch this movie for as long as you can. In spite of his relentless cruelty, I think the film is a powerful example of cinema, which is extremely scary, exploitative and effective. Scott has a tough job selling, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this movie are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directing decisions are just amazing and he's doing a great job in Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this movie, but I recommend it to those viewers looking for a great, action-packed movie.
