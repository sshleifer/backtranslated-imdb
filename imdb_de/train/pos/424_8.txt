I love this movie because I grew up with the trotting. Pat Boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father, who was attracted to the trotters, because men of normal height and weight, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, can be riders. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 Home in Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a completely different movie. April Love is easy and easy to see, a movie to feel good. (Disappointing, though Pat Boone's religious / moral beliefs have made it impossible for him to ever kiss the girl!) A home away from home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white without anyone getting into a song breaks) better captures the stress and fight, and makes the ultimate performance more satisfying, but requires a greater emotional investment.
