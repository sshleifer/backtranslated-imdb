<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made strange metaphysical fears popular, but this Canadian gemstone makes it weird. <br /> <br /> As with most weird movies, the less about plot, the better, but let's introduce the scene. Two friends, Anthony and Dave, have been together since childhood, they can not handle the world and ultimately that means they have to be no longer. But this is where more problems start. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile a long time after the end of the credits and that's a rare experience with so many mass productions of "nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
