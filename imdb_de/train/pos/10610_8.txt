A good-natured young miner with a sad past (Henry Thomas) meets a deserted girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her. The elders of the city generally support him to keep the child, although a local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. A determined little girl on a long walk and a scary traveling salesman (David Strathairn at its scariest) have parallel stories that converge fatefully. This is a charming piece of life in the Ozarks in the same direction as "Where The Lillies Bloom" & "The Dollmaker". All three were filmed on-site in these beautiful hills, reporting on the lives of the simple-minded but open-minded American people. A minimum of strong language and short but sharp violence make this fairly safe family visit.
