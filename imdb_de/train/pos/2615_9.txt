While I flipped through the large selection of films on the plane, I came across live! almost by chance. Oh boy! What a choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered that I had seen the trailer for more than a year, vague and had completely forgotten that I had not expected to be another cheesy nonsense film about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that this was an incredible ride. I do not remember the last time I was so excited and scared. I'm not sure if it was the altitude that was playing with my senses, but the tension grows gradually through the film until a peak is reached at which you can not turn away from the screen itself, literally sitting on the edge of the seat and me biting remaining nails Do you have. <br /> <br /> You will first go through a personal moral assessment of your position regarding the fairness of the show. They will stray from the idea "how can man be so evil" to "why not?". Ask yourself, would you do it. Then get to know the participants and their motives and start guessing. You will then see the candidate successively pull the trigger and get upset, even though you know the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good directing, with a film experience that reminds you of your old movies I knew what would happen in the next scene, but he still wanted more. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * A few things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - the casting of the participants. I was really moved by the farmer and we should have been a bit more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid. It felt like you were not interested in some of the candidates. Although this may have been intentional, I believe the audience should be able to connect with the majority of participants. - Rules of the game, a big breakdown: what happens if the 5th participant does not die when he pulls the trigger? Do you seriously think that the last guy pulls the trigger and does it himself !!! They should have given all contestants a chance to live, ie: If fifth is also a space, no one dies. Interestingly, I did not bother too much with these bad points because I really had a good time. I just wish I had popcorn with me!
