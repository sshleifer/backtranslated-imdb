May and her husband visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is cumbersome because the grandchildren and "children" do not really know each other as you would expect. The warmth that should be there is missing. After dinner, May's husband says he's not feeling well, blaming his daughter's kitchen and confusedly announcing that he wants to go home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> May, now widow, is lost. She obviously did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and although her own needs had been unfulfilled for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to her daughter Paula, who tells her mother shortly after her mother's arrival that she never felt that her mother had given herself much. She is disappointed with her mother's lack of care. May seems disarmed and surprised, but she does not seem to have the energy or desire to get it right. "I am your mother and I love you." What does that really say? (I've heard this all too often from my own mother and do not yet have to figure out what it means.) Paula is a bit (good, more than a bit) neurotic. Both women are in need, though they show it very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula was involved with Darren, a friend of her son, who is a craftsman who works in her son's house. While Paula works during the day, May starts talking to Darren and having lunch. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of his autistic son Nicky, but probably does not live with his wife. May is attracted to Darren because he is male She enjoys the connection they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (He's also interested in money that May says can make him "escape from everyday life," even though he's obviously not interested in her desire to go on such a journey.) They sleep together in one During the day, May enjoys fulfillment as a woman she has not known in years or ever expected to ever know again What she does is okay In a writing group that Paula runs, May is introduced, rather forced to come together with a widower she does not feel attracted to, there's a scene where she has sex with the older one, who clearly can not afford much, and it's really painful and disturbing when we get the total disgust Seeing Mays face as she endures the one-time horrible bondage, Paula finally discovers her mother's and Darren's sex through some very graphic sketches no doubt. <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly seen by many in many ways. Sympathies are shared. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May reveals in a short essay that at the end of the day, she felt as if she hated her children, and would go to pubs after sleeping before returning home to her husband. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a good mother does not think about leaving children alone while going to the local pub. However, May had previously revealed in the film that her husband did not like her having friends, so she had none. She did what he wanted. She was unhappy, but she accepted it because, as she said, "it was easier." May was not the best mother, but for those who tend to have sympathy for her, one could consider May's actions as the act of a woman who just wants to be sexual and wants to live "a few minutes" during her lifetime. A woman who just wanted someone who listened to her, knew her as a human being, had a friend and a lover. Paula, though neurotic and unhappy, may have become due to the fact removed parents who have raised her. Surely it is not hard to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made film that is more complex than I mentioned, and that will certainly leave the viewer with many potentially contradictory responses. It's a movie that's worth discussing and debating, and most of all, worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing the movie leaves us with is the horror and the fear of a lonely life. No matter who is considered "right" or "wrong", this age and loneliness issue, which causes a sense of fear in most of us, is inevitable.
