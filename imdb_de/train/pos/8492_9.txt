Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine and he is absolutely funny in this movie. Step by step, he suits him, Gedde Watanabe. The two work wonderfully together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like how Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) fight in their roles as leaders of their respective group. Both try so hard to keep calm, and then they eventually get into a fight (which is hysterical). First, they are both on the ground. Then Hunt jumps onto a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The fight then comes from the office to the factory. I love the fact that, after being separated from the workers, you both feel bad when you get things out of control. There is also a scene where you can see the influence Hunt had on Kazihiro. He is in his house and his boss from Japan arrives and says he wants to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Not a good day tomorrow. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: Factory is complete and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine how Michael Keaton says that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's really funny & also shows how radically different people can not only learn from each other, but also become good friends.
