This film is similar in many ways to the "enemy of the state" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we have an innocent (black) man who is being persecuted by the "government" with all the modern technology known to man. If the story is copied like this, it's usually a disaster. That does not apply here. Of course, I love everything that David Morse does, so my comments may not be fair, but there were more good things about this movie than that. The main baddy, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant and the story flowed with great extras like David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. However, our hero Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx) irritated most of the role. He is so out of place, breaks bad jokes and does not cause sympathy from the audience. Or not at first, the strange thing is that it grows on you somehow (and also on its followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised with a good, solid action movie with comedy bits. 10.7
