This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, the fat of the group, shows his talents as these generations of Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, the "king of the $ 1 bet," shows that he is no longer in Kansas by consistently increasing the stakes. Kyles laughter is really contagious and also offers a little eye candy for the ladies (as well as Matt). The dwarves, while they had their moments, did not live up to the Mexican Huttanz as he deserves. And finally we have our protagonist Ed. He gives hope to all of us, stubborn, lanky, pale people who are still searching for this special person. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just barely missed the theaters, this is a must as we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.
