I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. The fact that there are long train lanes available, bike rides from the station, soup stalls and other typical scenes that are so well represented has certainly contributed to my own appreciation for this film, which I really enjoyed. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film that are painted with vivid colors, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Suos Tricks were for the most part subtle; I found his emphasis on the character Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, which made her sublimely, a bit small, but most of the directors' tricks were so gentle that I was totally drawn in and just danced with his characters. Or cried. Or laughed out loud. Wonderful A +.
