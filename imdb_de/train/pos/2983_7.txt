BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh again, in a really stupid but often clever comedy. <br /> <br /> The two designers of South Park, the protagonists of this film, play surprisingly well, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The movie often reminded me of South Park - one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
