"Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, is sweet and charming, witty and poignant, but less significant. He is dedicated to everyone who was ever in love, in love, or never in love, but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare films that are / should be interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents alike. It seems to be a very simple little movie without spectacular visual effects, chases or long and hot sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke returning home after the summer in Europe and French student Julie Delpy traveling to Paris to attend class in Sorbonne) meet a train. They dress immediately before they start talking, getting off the train in Vienna and exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but instead it's a lovely, believable, smart and moving romance that only gets better every time you watch (at least for this spectator). Kudos and sincere gratitude goes to the director and the writers for two charming characters, great writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two great performances and the magical atmosphere in which everything falls in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like an Angel by Botticelli, is great at showing a smart, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
