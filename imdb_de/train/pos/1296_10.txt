It is an extremely difficult film, especially because it aims at the innermost core of our lives. But in the end it is a very beautiful and deeply moving movie. Anyone who thinks it's cynical has to say that they have missed the point of the overall message of the film. For those who actually watch the movie, they will find that the way the problems are handled is absolutely necessary, and ultimately the result is uplifting. Sure, it's hard to look at, a difficult subject and even brutal. However, it is extremely important to society and everyone. It's the culmination of what world cinema is doing (I'm not going to limit that to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is best to take a clear mind without being influenced by conflicting views and just let the movie work for you.
