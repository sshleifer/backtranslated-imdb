I liked this movie. I remember there was a very successful scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is lying in her bed and smoking, and then she begins to visualize that the Ramones are in the room singing the song "I Want You Around" ... very, very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yeah, I admit the end is over the top and far-fetched ... but it does not matter because it's fun that this is a very funny movie. It's sex, pot and rock n 'rocll forever. <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that originally starred in this movie. But I do not know if that's true or not
