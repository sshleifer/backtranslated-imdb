There should be a minor genre called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, generally underrated western family imports his film noir personality to draw compelling dark character sketches, producing an elegiac world fatigue more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah. "Man with the weapon" is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, the protégé of Orson Welles, it is a clear, monochrome beauty, full of refreshing silhouettes and fearsome bursts of ferocious violence, while Mitchum tames a city terrorized by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a soft-spoken stranger to a disturbed killer with a lot of dark emotions in between is a miracle of expressive, physical action.
