I saw Enchanted April for the first time about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April and leave their weary life behind. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you can not avoid rooting them when they plan this getaway with two other women inviting them to share the costs. This is perhaps the most comfortable movie I have ever seen. It is simple, without chases, no animosities and no deaths. It was made with care and great taste. You can not help but smile, except when you cry happy tears!
