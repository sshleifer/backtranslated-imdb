And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie and different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal," where she was more like a man-eater. I think she should have been nominated for a jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did a good job for the first time, and I noticed that he had taken some of his mates from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage & Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them here, I did not know that they would appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw a romantic Quebec comedy I did not like and this one is as good as any I've ever seen. And if you're in the United States wondering how to get a DVD, www.archambault.ca has delivered it to me in less than a week.
