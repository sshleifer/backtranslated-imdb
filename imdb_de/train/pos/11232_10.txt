Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get into the special effect path, but Hidden Frontier has consistently been doing good storylines and performances right from the beginning and was always ready to make mistakes that they made. They advise people to first watch newer episodes so they can see how good the show is, and understand how much they've changed since the first few episodes. The cast has a fantastic camaraderie and shows it on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors leaving their mark on the show and fans also testifies to the show as the action grows stronger. The show has encountered barriers with its various storylines - depression, drug addiction, and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed some people the wrong way, but that's exactly what Star Trek is and is. It portrays these storylines in an intelligent and emotional way and handles them subtly and smoothly. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters from the trek story, but they did them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler, and Necheyev, who were not used enough on the show, were in the New Frontier Books A Rebirth They lost their sizzle after a while, when Peter David turned rather to wild fantasy over serious science fiction technique and HF shows these characters in a completely different light, which makes them feel better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and get to know the people involved. They release Bloopers for each episode, so fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people who do it in their spare time, with a dedication that would have shocked many professional actors! <br /> <br /> What has reached this series, which ends after seven years, with such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - it brings people together and inspires others to do the same. HF will live long after his end, as long as people still enjoy the reason they started out.
