CHANCES ARE is an enchanting romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after she learns she is pregnant. Then we see the man in heaven who lets the powers know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth, but not like himself. Flashforward 19 years in which we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing for high school and a young man (Robert Downey Jr.). ), which turns out to be a reincarnation of her father. The movie is a little predictable ... the story goes to all the places you expect it to be, but it's so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but wrap yourself up the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to benefit better, and she and Downey are supported by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. An enchanting and enchanting fantasy that will enchant and enchant you.
