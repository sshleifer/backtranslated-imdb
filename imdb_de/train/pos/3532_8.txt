Scott Henderson, the engineer who employs Carol Richman as his assistant, insists on calling her "Kansas" whenever he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, effectively played by Ella Raines, is said to be a baby in the woods as far back as 1940s Manhattan. Only a woman from the city would follow the shady bartender to a lonely subway. Even then, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak has managed this movie very well. He has a flair for giving the story a lot of raw sex, which was surprising for those days. How else could one justify how the drummer in the orchestra of the musical, in which Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, walks so openly with a lady on a date? The drummer, who was played with high tension by Elisha Cook Jr., hides his desires for none of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical in which he plays. It was a real express invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of the story, Fay Helm; Afterwards, Cliff, the drummer, very openly advocates for Ella Raines, who goes to the theater disguised as the mysterious lady, her boss had originally made. This is a movie that will captivate every viewer from the beginning. There are things that are not explained in it, but it holds the whole interest. The killer will only be revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines was an underrated actress with her expressive eyes. She holds against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor who works in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis looks like a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the obstinacy of the woman who secretly loved him. As Inspector Burgess, Thomas Gomez is an asset to the film because the police doubt that the police caught the man who committed the crime. This movie will not disappoint.
