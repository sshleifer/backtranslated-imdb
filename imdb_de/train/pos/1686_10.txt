After a long, hard week behind the desk making all the important decisions, this movie is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio show, this movie takes you to a land of alien humor and the sci-fi parading. Captain Zippo died in the big charge of the Buick. He was a brave man. The Jack Nicholson impressions shine through this strange face with the dark sunglasses and the leather jacket. Always remember to beware of the death donut! Remember Rule # 1 of this movie - Suspending Unbelief - Sit back and relax. You only have to see it yourself.
