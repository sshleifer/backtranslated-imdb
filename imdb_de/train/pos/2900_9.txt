If it is an American movie, I would rate it with 7: We have already seen. Since this is an Argentine movie and I am an Argentine myself, I would like to give it a 10 because it is the quality I was hoping for - rather than expected -. The quality is amazing, given the limitations imposed by 3rd World ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene in which Díaz compels Silverstein's fiancé to confess - you know what I mean, if you see the movie. I think that's the key moment of the movie, maybe not surprising, but original. Then the actual action begins. <br /> <br /> Before I see a movie, I always try to gather previous information. As this is a mainstream satyrist, commercial, I express "play" and make a reversal of reality and logic. I would say the best condition to enjoy movies like this one. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the entire conspiracy, but it is credible in a certain way. As for me, I could not stop laughing at every single joke and comment - "sos malo" ("you're mean") ... in the mouth of Díaz, the biggest one. <br /> <br /> I'm really tired of watching movies designed for Peretti. I know that he is a great actor, but sometimes I find his roles unfairly opaque, the rest, Luis Luque's role in this case. I do not like Argentine TV very much so I did not see much of Luque's work, but it's pretty obvious he's a great performer. His physical role, his looks, his attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should be improved a little so that he can show us how great he can be! I do not know if Szifrón plans a sequel or not. I know he will not succeed if he follows the rule that "second parts were never good". If he succeeds, I will certainly see it. And I hope that in the future the possibility will be taken to give Peretti's colleagues the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performances and a lot of laughter!
