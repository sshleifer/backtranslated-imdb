In Mexico, this movie was only aired on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of a good German and especially a good man. Particularly interesting are the discussions between Tukurs character and the Nazi prosecutor. A true idea war: Two different Germans, both believe in it. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, friend, churchman and a great intellectual. Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I have highly recommended this film, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer and his heritage. This is a great job to save a forgotten hero.
