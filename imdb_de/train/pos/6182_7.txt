This murder mystery with musical numbers is long in atmosphere and character, but rather in tension and plausibility. Based on a stage play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage ambience (a murder investigation takes place on the opening night in the theater where a musical revue is staged). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and varied: Victor McLaglen, the hardened cop who conducts the investigation, and always stupidly looks at the showgirl that is just in sight; Jack Oakie (the pre-war Jack Lemmon or Jack Lemmon of post-war Jack Oakie?) A troubled director who has to coordinate the staging and the chaos behind the scenes; the always homely Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe gentleman with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who ends up with a stunning monologue up close, as the trembling girl who falls madly in love with the male lead; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as this male lead role that did not once but twice ravage the classic "Cocktails for Two"; Kitty Carlisle, the "Where do they come from and where are they going" and other operational Johnston Coslow songs supply; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who had separated from us too soon, as a mean showgirl whose love for Brisson is spurned; The usually ridiculous Toby Wing, who is here at least the center of a laughing joke. <br /> <br /> When the complications of the complications get out of hand, there is always an interesting performer or a funny and sonorous musical number that distracts the observer. The most famous sequence of the film is the "Marahuana" number led by Michael, which is, apart from the controversial story, really one of the lesser musical offerings. All the songs here are staged as if they could actually fit into a standard Proscenium theater space, in contrast to the cinematic fantasy setup of the Busby Berkeley style.
