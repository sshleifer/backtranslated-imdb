Wonderful family drama / comedy with MacClaine and Garr, who keeps and warms the heart every time I see it. Highly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grandmas. Beautiful piece that captured 1962. The story includes Garr fighting, their two children, and Aunt Zena (MacClaine), who tries to make ends meet without a man as head of the household. The "family" moves west to inherit the legacy of a long forgotten relative who left Garr a run-down, rundown sidewalk café dating back to the late 1940s. The stubborn Garr as a sweet but determined mother brings the whole family into the restoration and opening of the café. But wait ... Aunt Zena is an old circus artist with card tricks, magical powders and a funny humor. She loves to lure the kids and them into silly and sometimes dangerous games. Next comes a wonderful combination of "Miracle at Lords" thrown together with the Cuban missile crises (with authentic real-time TV news) and a "ghost" stroke that gets completely out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiosity, and gives a disquieting glimpse of the frightening fear of the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In the end, the miracle of faith, family, and rediscovered love remains. Oh, and the music from the early 60s is just great! <br /> <br /> Recommend STRONGLY as FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out 10
