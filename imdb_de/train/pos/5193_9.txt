The sword fighting was out of this world, the fights are spectacular without the techniques flown on the tightrope (until the end), which are far too common today. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the film. The characters in the attack on the Evil Villa were a clich√©, but the movie agrees. A shot of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> The plot with its twists was unpredictable and exciting and you could not tell who was good or bad or which side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of excitement and temporal surprises. The depth of the story is pretty intense for a fleeting movie of this genre and reaches you in a way that most kung fu films do not.
