This story is known in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that if you do not catch the mouse, two cats will be expelled except a cat (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed buddy ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so this really upsets "Mammy Two Shoes," who can not believe they have a mouse in spite of TWO cats in the house. Anyway, the one who gets Jerry can stay while the other one gets the shoe, so the competition is in! <br /> <br /> Although it's a familiar area, I still enjoyed it because the cartoon had enough original gags to entertain you. They had not only the cats but also Jerry in the equation. So there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a Tom & Jerry fan.
