But the fun is on the journey. <br /> <br /> I found this movie extremely enjoyable, not only that both leads are extremely eye-friendly, the humor of the understaffing and the jokes have really made me laugh several times aloud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a romantic clich√© comedy. But the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding a single true love sounds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is dead and the drama is well done in all areas, and exaggerated for a weird effect. The Bulgari scene is worth the gold, the actress deserves a mention! For those who have made it predictable - predictable - If you want a movie with twists and turns that will make you guess ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it definitely paid off. <br /> <br /> Great Date Movie, great movie for a happy cry ...
