While the premise of the film is quite lame (Ollie is diagnosed with "Hornophobia"), the film is a friendly and enjoyable little filmstrip. It's also a bit better than the movies they shot after that - probably because this was the last Halel-produced Laurel and Hardy movie. It would not be a bad idea NOT to watch the latest movies because all the chemistry in these films is lost and the guys play their role only for pathos - something that Laurel and Hardy would never do. They had a certain advantage that all later films do not have. <br/> <br /> Stan and Ollie work in a horn factory. That sounds pretty weird, but it is not. Not surprisingly, Ollie has a nervous breakdown with the whole racket and has to take some time off work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last movie with the team) recommends a voyage. However, they do not like sailing, and Stan has the idea of ​​simply renting a boat tied to the dock. Then they can get all the sea air they want without having to worry about the trouble. Once they are on the boat, a dangerous criminal can leave the boat and they all go to sea accidentally. Fortunately, this part of the movie was actually good and the end worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a great full-length Laurel and Hardy movie, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and annoying musical numbers (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). Plus, there's still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would hardly see after this movie. Part of this was due to the declining health of the boys (and the growing size of Ollie), and part of it was due to the general drowsiness of these later films.
